**Key Quote:** "Varahadeva is completely unperturbed because the Lord is the supreme proprietor of everything."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Hiranyaksha and Varahadeva, emphasizing the Lord's supreme power and the insignificance of demons before Him.

Because he wanted to show off. So then he approached Varanadeva and he said, I heard you are very powerful, why don't you fight with me? So Varanadeva said, I am old, I am retired, please leave me Baba, don't fight with me, don't worry, soon there will come one person, Vishnu will come, he will take care of you. So from that time, he was searching, where is Vishnu? So when he came across finally Varanadeva, Vishnu in the form of Varanadeva, so he was thinking that, ah, I am so powerful, I will finish off this Vishnu also, what is this Vishnu in front of me? So until that point of time, nobody had dared to stand up and talk to him even. So when he approached Varanadeva and started insulting him, Varanadeva immediately gave it back to him. So he got angry, how can somebody talk to me like this? So, Shaila Prabhupada is saying here, the Bhagavatam is saying here, that in the purport, Shaila Prabhupada is saying, that a cobra may be very fierce for an ordinary person. Like I said, if a cobra were to enter into this room, what would happen? Everyone would start running here and there, right? No one will sit here. But if there is a snake charmer, among the monsters, what he will do, he will not fear, he will immediately take out his, whatever that he blows, and he will immediately start chanting his mantras and he will subdue the serpent. Simply catch it with his hand and he will take it and go away, isn't it? Just like in Vandavan, because we are in the midst of open fields, sometimes snakes come into our campus. So when snakes come, then all the staff, everybody starts running around and everybody is yelling and shouting and all that, and we get some snake charmer. So when the snake charmer comes, everybody tells him, see, it's there in that bush, it is sitting there. So he will go there, he will put his hand, take it and he will have a basket, he will put in that, he will take and he will go. And you pay him something for that. So snake charmer is not afraid of the snake. For him, what is there, it is a plaything. So similarly, Hiranyaksha, a demon, might sometimes become very powerful. He may become extremely powerful. Just like this Hiranyaksha, he is so powerful, even the devatas, none of the devatas were courageous enough to stand in front of him. Even Varanadeva said, no, I don't want to fight with you. So a demon may become so powerful, but in front of the Lord, in front of Vishnu, in front of Krishna, they are nothing. So Varahadeva is not perturbed by Hiranyaksha's strength or his power or his reputation.

**Key Quote:** "So no matter how powerful a demon may become, for the Supreme Lord, he is nothing."
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the source of power through the story of Hiranyakashipu and Prahlad, highlighting that even demons' power comes from Vishnu and devotees may face harassment from demons, but the Lord ultimately protects them.

Varahadeva is completely unperturbed because the Lord is the supreme proprietor of everything. He is the most powerful, he is all-powerful. And in fact, all power is coming from him. If the demon is powerful, where is that power coming from? Just like when Hiranyakashyapu, he was trying to kill Prahlad Maharaj, his own son, five-year-old son. He tried various means to kill him. Put him into a pit full of snakes, threw him down from the top of a cliff, tried to trample him with elephants, all of that failed. And when that failed, Hiranyakashyapu started getting afraid. And he questioned Prahlad Maharaj, where are you getting this power from? None of the devatas can stand in front of me, you are just a five-year-old kid, and all my attempts to kill you are failing. How have you become so much powerful? So Prahlad Maharaj replied, whatever is the source of your power is also the source of my power, which is Vishnu. So when he heard that, Hiranyakashyapu could not tolerate. That is how he said, where is your Vishnu, show me, is he in this pillar? And we know the rest, what happened. So, no matter how powerful a demon may become, for the Supreme Lord, he is nothing. And these demons, when they become powerful, they try to harass devotees. So sometimes devotees become perturbed that this demon is there, he is attacking, he is creating so much harassment for us. Just like Hiranyakashyapu, so much he harassed Prahlad Maharaj. And Prahlad Maharaj was very disturbed, but he pacified himself by remembering Vishnu and Krishna. By chanting Krishna's holy name, he managed to calm himself. So similarly, in all of our devotees' lives, there will be circumstances where we will see some demon become very powerful. And he will harass devotees. It may, the harassment may last for several years.

#### Ravana's power and defeat, Lord Shiva's helplessness, Krishna's protection

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Rakhe Krishna Mareke, Mare Krishna Rakheke."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Ravana's defeat by Lord Ramachandra, emphasizing that even Lord Shiva could not protect Ravana when Krishna decided to kill him, illustrating the principle that whom Krishna protects, no one can kill, and whom Krishna wants to kill, no one can protect.

But finally, when the Lord decides to vanquish him, then nobody can come in the way. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada is mentioning the pastime of Ravana. Ravana was another demon who was so powerful. He was so powerful that he wanted to build a staircase directly to heaven. He was thinking, what is all this Punya, Girnya and all you have to go to heaven? I will build one staircase, let everyone go. What, only devatas should enjoy heaven or what? So he started building a staircase to heaven. He was so powerful. And he was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. And because of pleasing Lord Shiva, he had become very powerful. So when the battle between Ravana and Lord Ramachandra was going on, the fight was raging. And on one side, Ravana, on the other side, Ramachandra. And arrows were being exchanged, weapons were being aimed at each other. The fight was going on. And one by one, slowly all of Ravana's weapons were getting destroyed. So his chariot got destroyed, his horses were destroyed, his charioteer was finished, his flag was cut off, everything was finished. And then his bow also broke. So then Ramachandra fixed his last bow, last arrow on his bow. And he aimed it at Ravana. And Ravana knew, this is the end. Now, I cannot protect myself. So he immediately remembered Lord Shiva. And he started calling out to Lord Shiva. Go Shiva, please protect me, please save me. So Lord Shiva was sitting in Kailasa, sitting with Parvati Devi. So Lord Shiva heard Ravana's cry. Ravana's cry reached up till there. But Lord Shiva was unmoved. He was silently sitting. So Parvati Devi, naturally because she is Lord Shiva's wife, so she has a... She has that little bit of familiarity with him. So she said, What is this you are sitting here, your devotee is crying. Go, do something. Just like wives will tell husbands, No, what useless fellow sitting there, do something. No, like that. No, like that Parvati Devi will tell, What is this you are sitting here, your devotee is crying. Why don't you go and do something? So Lord Shiva replied, Devi, what can I do? Supreme Lord Ramachandra has decided to kill him. What will I do going to there? The Lord has already decided, I cannot do anything, sorry. So Ravana was crying and crying for Lord Shiva's protection. But in the meantime, Ramachandra fixed his arrow, released it and Ravana was finished. So even Lord Shiva refused to protect Ravana because he knew that now that Ramachandra Bhagavan, he has decided to kill Ravana, even I cannot protect him. Srila Prabhupada used to often quote that saying, Rakhe Krishna Mareke, Mare Krishna Rakheke. Rakhe Krishna, if Krishna wants to protect someone, Mareke, who can kill him? Just like Krishna wanted to protect Prahlad Maharaj, even Hiranyakashipu could not do anything. And on the other hand, Mare Krishna, if Krishna wants to kill someone, just like Ramachandra decided to kill Ramana, Rakheke, who can protect that person?

#### Humility of devotees, Difference between Lord's and demon's anger, Source of anger for non-devotees
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/KTHudZWO2Ac?t=782
**Verse References:** BG 2.62
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So the source of anger amongst non-devotees is the desire for sense gratification."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the humility of devotees with the pride of demons, explaining that the Lord's anger is for the welfare of living entities, while the anger of non-devotees arises from the desire for sense gratification, as explained in Bhagavad Gita.

Nobody can protect. So, the demons become very puffed up by their own power and strength, thinking that they are all powerful. But devotees, as devotees, we should not become puffed up whenever the Lord invests certain power in us for executing certain services. So as devotees, devotees are always humble and they know that the source of my strength and power is Krishna, is Vishnu. So they always treat that power which is invested in them by Krishna with lot of humility. Another thing that we can notice here is that Varahadeva also became angry and Hiranyakashipu also became angry. Both of them became angry. So what is the difference between the Lord and the demon? So the difference is that when the Lord becomes angry, his anger is for the welfare of the living entity. The Lord for the welfare of the demons, he becomes angry with them. So that by his anger, he can punish them and by that punishment they become purified of their offenses and they can become liberated. Whereas, the source of anger for the asuras, it's something else. Actually, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 62nd verse, 62nd and 63rd verse, Krishna explains what is the source of anger for the non-devotees. So Krishna says in the 62nd verse, ध्यायतो विषयान पुम्सा संगस्तेशु पजायते संगार्थ संजायते कामहा प्रोधो विजायते While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them and from such attachment, lust develops and from lust, anger arises. So the source of anger amongst non-devotees is the desire for sense gratification. So because of the desire for sense gratification, when a person contemplates on the objects of the senses, he develops attachment for them, he wants to fulfill his desire to gratify his senses. And then when he, and out of that and from such attachment, when he lusts after satisfying that desire, eventually that lust becomes frustrated. He is not able to fulfill that lust to the fullest extent. Then because of that frustration, anger arises.

#### Dangers of anger, Importance of sense control (Dhamma), Importance of mind control (Shama)
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/KTHudZWO2Ac?t=949
**Verse References:** BG 2.63, BG 2.58, BG 2.60
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "From anger, delusion arises and from delusion, bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost. And when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the dangers of anger, leading to delusion and downfall, and emphasizes the importance of both sense control (Dhamma) and mind control (Shama) for spiritual progress, referencing verses from the Bhagavad Gita.

Now when a normal conditioned soul becomes angry, Krishna explains further in the next verse what actually further happens, what does that anger lead to? क्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोहाथ स्मुर्थि विभ्रमः स्मुर्थि ब्रंशाद् बुद्धि नाश्यो बुद्धि नाश्याद् प्रणश्यति From anger, delusion arises and from delusion, bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost. And when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool. So we can see here, Krishna is describing the danger of becoming subjugated by anger. Actually in fact, in the little previous to this, in the 58th verse, Krishna mentions यदा सम्हरते चायम कोर्मों गानेव सर्वशः इन्द्रियाणि इन्द्रियार्थेब्य स्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws his limbs within the shell, is to be understood as truly situated in knowledge. So Krishna in the 58th verse, he spoke about Dhamma, controlling the senses. That we all have to control our senses. The senses cannot be freely left to enjoy the sense objects. Now Dhamma entails gross control of the senses. Whereas in the 62nd and 63rd verse, Krishna is speaking actually of Shama, controlling the mind. One is the force of the senses, which impels us to enjoy the sense objects. And the second is the force of the mind. The mind generates certain desires. So if the mind is uncontrolled, then it finally leads to anger, and anger leads to further entanglement in this material world. So, Shama and Dhamma. Dhamma is important, Shama is also important. If we do not control our senses, if Dhamma is not practiced, Krishna says what happens in the 60th verse. He says, यततो ही अप्यकाऊंते ये पुरिशत्सि विपस्चिता इन्द्रियानि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसवं मनः The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavouring to control them. So even a knowledgeable person, even a person who is a person of discrimination, not an ordinary person, विपस्चिता a person of discrimination, a learned person, an intelligent person, a person who is a ज्यानी even such a person, if his senses are not controlled, what will happen? He will be led to destruction. So, one is दमा another is शमा as we read in the 62nd and 63rd verses, if a person does not practice शमा, he may very well control his senses, but then, if his mind is not controlled, then that will eventually again lead him to destruction.

#### Practice of Dhamma and Shama for devotees, Dangers of uncontrolled mind, Mood of the Brajavasis
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/KTHudZWO2Ac?t=1145

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "I am not attached to doing something big or small, I am attached to pleasing Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while devotees easily practice Dhamma (sense control), Shama (mind control) is often overlooked, and emphasizes the importance of controlling the mind to avoid frustration and maintain interest in Krishna consciousness, highlighting the selfless mood of the Brajavasis who only desire to please Krishna.

So both दमा and शमा are important. Now, in the case of devotees, what happens is दमा is very easily practiced. We follow the four regularity principles strictly, then automatically दमा is practiced. And, but then शमा is something which we consciously, we may miss out in practicing. दमा is very conscious, we will consciously follow. I should avoid onion, garlic, I should not eat meat, I should eat only कृष्ण प्रसादम, very easily we can follow. But शमा is something which many times may miss our attention, that we have to control the mind also. On one level, controlling the mind means we do not allow the mind to dwell on material sense objects. On a higher plane, दमा also means that we cannot allow the mind to think whatever it wants. Sometimes devotees get carried away, that no according to me it should be like this, according to me we should do like this. And then when things don't happen according to the way they are thinking, they become frustrated. And they start thinking, what is all this, I thought I came to devotional service thinking that everything will be nice here, but there are so many problems here, this is not okay, that is not okay. And finally the person will lose his interest in कृष्ण consciousness. So, in the case of devotees, we have to be very careful to practice this शमा, this control of the mind. Sometimes this uncontrolled mind will generate some thoughts which will seem almost like devotional service, it will look like devotional service only. Sometimes devotees think, no I should do something big for कृष्ण and we give them some service, what is this small service you are giving me, I want to do something big, give me some bigger service. So, actually if one has such a mentality, even if one becomes a PR devotee, one will not be able to have permanent residence in the spiritual world. One will have to keep coming back to that. One will have to keep coming back to the material world. Because if we have that desire, I should do something big for कृष्ण. कृष्ण will say, okay, you continue doing that in the material world, you be there and you keep doing big things. Such people will generally become देवताःs. They are pure devotees, but they become देवताःs because they have some desire to serve कृष्ण in some big capacity. So कृष्ण says, okay, remain in the material world and do big things. So, a devotee of the highest order, will generally, will not have this kind of thought. If we look at the ब्रजवासीs, why are they considered the topmost devotees, even above the देवताःs? Why? Because the ब्रजवासीs, they have no desire other than to please कृष्ण. If कृष्ण is pleased by my doing some small service, I will do that small service. I will be happy doing that small service. If कृष्ण wants me to do some big service, then I will do that big service. I am not attached to doing something big or small, I am attached to pleasing कृष्ण.

#### Srila Prabhupada's example, Surrender to Krishna's will, Glories of Goloka Vrindavan devotees

**Key Quote:** "Make me a success or a failure as you wish."
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the mood of a topmost devotee through Srila Prabhupada's example, emphasizing his surrender to Krishna's will and detachment from success or failure, highlighting the respect and glorification of devotees in Goloka Vrindavan.

This is the mood of the ब्रजवासीs. And we can see that very strongly reflected in प्रभुपाद's life also. When प्रभुपाद was going to the US on the जलदूता, he wrote the poem, मार्किने भागवत धर्म So there, प्रभुपाद says, he prays for प्रभुपाद, he prays to कृष्ण, प्रभुपाद prays to कृष्ण, saying that, you have brought me to this land of the मलेचास and यवनास I do not know whether I will be able to convince them about कृष्ण consciousness. And then प्रभुपाद says, make me a success or a failure as you wish. You see, प्रभुपाद did not pray, कृष्ण I have come here to serve you, please make me a big success. प्रभुपाद is saying, make me a success or a failure as you wish. And प्रभुपाद says, make me dance, make me dance, make me dance. You see, this is the mood of a devotee of the topmost order. He is not attached to doing something big or something small. He just sees what कृष्ण wants. If कृष्ण is happy by my becoming a failure, I will become a failure. If कृष्ण is happy by my going to नरका, I will go to नरका. If कृष्ण wants me to go to स्वर्गा, I will go to स्वर्गा. Doesn't matter where I go, the central point is pleasing कृष्ण. And this is the mood of devotees in गोलोक वृण्दावन. Therefore, those devotees in गोलोक वृण्दावन are always respected everywhere. They are glorified by all devotees, by देवताश्य, everyone glorifies them, they respect them, they look up to them. They aspire to become like them. This is the standard of the highest order of devotees. And the same thing is what Śrīla Prabhupāda taught us, and the same thing

#### Following Srila Prabhupada's example, Satisfying Krishna in whatever service, Dangers of seeking attention and praise

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even the smallest thing, just cleaning the floor, you do it nicely, it's enough."
**Summary:** The speaker encourages devotees to follow Srila Prabhupada's example by satisfying Krishna and Prabhupada in whatever service they are given, emphasizing that even the smallest service done with dedication is pleasing to them, and cautioning against the desire for attention and praise.

Prabhupāda demonstrated in his life also. So we have to, we as devotees, following in Śrīla Prabhupāda's footsteps, following the example that Śrīla Prabhupāda said, we should try to satisfy कृष्ण and Śrīla Prabhupāda in whatever service we are given. It's not that we have to do something really big to satisfy प्रवुपा and कृष्ण. Even the smallest thing, just cleaning the floor, you do it nicely, it's enough. कृष्ण and प्रवुपा is pleased. If प्रवुपा and कृष्ण are pleased by my cleaning the floor, I'll keep cleaning the floor all throughout my life, no problem. This is the real mood of a devotee and one has to train one's mind to accept this mood and practice this mood. Otherwise mind always wants to do something which will gain lot of attention, lot of पूजा, प्रतिष्ठा, लाभा. So if I do some big service, many people will come and congratulate me, many people will come and praise me, that is very pleasing for me. Therefore I want to do big service. So the mind always tends towards these things. So actually in our condition stage, if we think that I want to do something big for कृष्ण, actually the motivation is not pleasing कृष्ण. The motivation is I want to do something big so that everybody will appreciate, people's attention will be there. Right now I am doing something nobody comes to know about it. What is this? I am going inside the अस्तन पुजार room, something I am scrubbing, nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody appreciates. So that's not the point. So we should be careful. So this will look almost like कृष्ण consciousness. We are serving कृष्ण only, what is wrong? But actually behind that there is another thing going. So we have to be careful about this, what we think, we have to control, we have to train the mind to be satisfied

#### Satisfaction in assigned duties, Freedom from material duties, Reactions for not performing duties

**Verse References:** BG 3.17
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For him there is no duty."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees who do not find full satisfaction in performing their assigned devotional service become liable for not performing their material duties, quoting Bhagavad Gita to emphasize that only those who are fully satisfied in the self are free from all duties.

in whatever service is given to us. Actually कृष्ण explains in the third chapter of the बगवत गीता, I will read that verse. एस्तु आत्मरतिरैवस्यात् आत्मत्रप्तस्य मानवः आत्मसंतुष्टस्तस्य कार्यम्न विद्यते So for a person who is engaged in devotional service, what happens is we devotees, we do not practice any other duties that we are supposed to perform according to the Vedas. According to the Vedas we have so many रनाs to fulfill, रनाs to parents, रना to one's forefathers, रना to the देवता's, रना to the teachers, रना to the रिशी's, रना to the रिशी's, so many people, we have so many kinds of रनाs. But then what happens is we don't follow any of those, actually in Kali Yuga nobody follows any of those duties. Instead, it is said that in Kali Yuga we have to simply serve Krishna, right? Now if we don't perform our duties which are enjoined in the scriptures, actually one becomes liable to liable for the reactions to those sinful activities. It is considered a sinful activity not to perform one's duties. Now as devotees what happens is if we do not find full satisfaction in performing one's devotional service whatever is assigned to us, then actually we will also become liable for not performing those material duties. That is why Krishna says यस्त्वात्मरेतिरेवस्यात् आत्मत्रत्तस्यमानमः आत्मन्येवसंतुष्टस्तस्यकार्यम्नविद्यते कार्यम्नविद्यते means a person does not have to perform those duties. Who is the person who does not have to perform those duties? This is the seventeenth verses. One who is taking pleasure in the self, number one. Number two, one who is illumined in the self. And number third, one who rejoices in the self, number three, and is satisfied with the self only, fully satiated, for him there is no duty. So, until and unless we come to the point where one is completely satisfied in performing whatever duties are assigned to one by one spiritual master, then one cannot, until that point one cannot be free from the obligations to perform one's material duties. So as devotees we should train our mind to be satisfied, to take satisfaction only in performing the assigned duties to us in whatever service we are doing. If we are not feeling that satisfaction, then we have to understand that I am going to get the reaction for all, for not performing all my material duties.

#### Practice of Shama, Avoiding sense gratification, Freedom from anger

**Key Quote:** "And thus one can be safe from the dangerous effects of Krodha."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of practicing Shama (mind control) to avoid sense gratification and the dangerous effects of anger, opening the floor for questions and comments.

So, this is another important thing that in the practice of Shama, that devotees have to diligently follow. So, if one practices controlling the mind in this fashion, if one practices Shama, then naturally one does not, one's mind will not try to find satisfaction in the sense objects. And when our mind is not engaged in trying to satisfying the sense objects, there is no question of frustration of one's attempts leading to Krodha or anger. And thus one can be safe from the dangerous effects of Krodha. So these are some of the points which we can glean from this. If there are any questions or comments,

#### Desire to serve Krishna, Devotional service of the highest order, Serving Krishna according to His desire

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Desiring to serve Krishna in some big way, it is not that it is not devotional service."
**Summary:** In response to a question, the speaker clarifies that desiring to serve Krishna in any way is devotional service, but the highest order of devotional service is to desire to serve Krishna according to His desire.

A devotee is denying some, you said that if a devotee is denying some services, discriminating the services, and in the future he may become a pure devotee, you mentioned. So how does the devotee who denies, discriminates the services, becomes a pure devotee? I didn't get the question. What was that? You said in the class, if a devotee is denying the menial services, want to do some big services, so in the future if he becomes a pure devotee also, he will become Devata in the material world. So how does a devotee who denies the, discriminates the services, and he can become a pure devotee? Well, the point is that, desiring to serve Krishna, in any way, is also devotional service only. It's not that it is not devotional service. If somebody desires, I should serve Krishna in some big way, it is not out of the ambit of devotional service. Because of one's past conditioning, one may have that ambition to do something big. So you dovetail that desire in doing something big for Krishna. Nothing wrong in that. But then, one has to go beyond even that. One has to, one has to go to a stage, where one will be simply interested in, serving Krishna's desires, whether as a success or a failure. So, such a devotee, when he becomes completely liberated, he will go to the supreme abode. He will go to the Goloka Vrindavan. So that is the point. So, desiring to serve Krishna in some big way, it is not that it is not devotional service. So that is also devotional service only, but it is not devotional service of the highest order. The main point is, when, when, higher than that is, to desire to serve Krishna according to his desire. That is more, that is even higher than desiring to serve Krishna in some big way. Is that okay?

#### Taking pleasure in the self, Atmarathi, Atmatruthah, Atmanyeva Santoshra, Progressive state of spiritual advancement

**Key Quote:** "By serving Krishna, everything else is performed."
**Summary:** In response to a question, the speaker explains the meaning of 'taking pleasure in the self' and the progressive states of Atmarathi, Atmatruthah, and Atmanyeva Santoshra, emphasizing that a person who is satisfied with the Self has come to a final conclusion and understands that by serving Krishna, everything else is performed.

Yes, please. Taking pleasure in the self, what it actually means. When we say taking pleasure only in the self, what it means is that, one, like Prabhupada is mentioning here, in the purport to that 17th verse, I will read that. Actually, those three things, that Prabhupada mentions, Krishna mentions, Atmarathi, Atmatruthah, and Atmanyeva Santoshra. These three are connected. So, Atmarathi means, a person, when a person engages in, when a, when a person, Atmarathi means one who takes pleasure only in the self. A person who is fully Krishna conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts in Krishna consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform. Due to his being Krishna conscious, all impiety within is instantly cleansed, and effect of many many thousands of Vijnaya performances. So actually Atmarathi means, a person who understands that, he is not the body, he is a spirit soul. So he is interested only in spiritual subject matter. He is not interested in satisfying his senses, right? So he is not interested in searching after the sense objects. He is more interested in understanding, he is more interested in understanding about himself, in spiritual subject matter. So such a person is said to be, taking pleasure only in the self. And, when one engages in, in devotional service to Krishna, with that understanding, that he wants to, with that, keeping away the desire for sense gratification, then what happens is, by such clearing of consciousness, one becomes fully confident of his eternal position, in relationship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated. So, Atma-tripta, Srila Prabhupada is translating, Atma-tripta as, one who is illumined in the self. So illumined in the self meaning, when one is engaged in understanding, when one is engaged in spiritual pursuit, and one engages in service to Krishna, one understands that, Oh! I am a servant of Krishna. This is my true position. So, such a position is called, self-illuminated, means he understands that he is a servant of Krishna, he is a part and parcel of Krishna, and he has to serve Krishna. And such a person, Atma-santushtaha, he is satisfied with the self only. Meaning, he is fully satiated, meaning he is satisfied, so by, first is he, he takes, he does activities only, related to spiritual subject matter. He is not interested in sense gratification. That is Atmarathi. And as an Atmarathi, when one understands that I am, I have to serve Krishna, I am a part and parcel of Krishna, then he becomes self-illuminated. Atma-tripta. And when in, when, when on that platform of understanding, I am part and parcel of Krishna, one is completely satisfied by serving Krishna. Oh! I am part and parcel of Krishna, I do service for Krishna, I am fully satisfied. He doesn't, he has come to a final conclusion. He is no more searching. There is no more search. What am I supposed to do? What are my duties? Nothing. This is the final thing. By serving Krishna, everything else is performed. So that is the level of satisfaction that a person feels. So then, that person is called an Atma-santushta. So that is a person who is satiated only in, only with the Self. So one is taking pleasure in the Self, one is illumined in the Self, and finally, one is satisfied with the Self. So this is, these are the three things. It's a progressive state.

#### Devatas vs. Brajavasis, Love vs. Duty, Following Srila Prabhupada's instructions

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada is giving us residence in Goloka Vrindavan."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between Devatas and Brajavasis, highlighting that Brajavasis serve Krishna out of pure love, beyond a sense of duty, and emphasizes that by following Srila Prabhupada's instructions and understanding his mood, we can attain residence in Goloka Vrindavan.

Yes. Not necessarily, because Devatas have, there are many kinds of personalities amongst Devatas also. There are, there are, they are all devotees, they may, some of them are Sakama Bhaktas, some of them are pure devotees, Devatas are all kinds. Brajavas is, Brajavas is of course, they are, they are not only satisfied in serving Krishna, they are, they are serving Krishna out of full love. So they are beyond even this stage, right? You see, the difference between the Brajavasis and a normal devotee is, a liberated devotee is, a liberated devotee still has a sense of duty. He is performing his service to Krishna out of his sense of duty. I am a servant of Krishna, Krishna is the Supreme Lord, so I have to serve Him. That sense is there. Whereas in the Brajavasis, they are, they are not bothered whether Krishna is Supreme Person or not, they are not bothered. We just love Krishna, we want to serve Him. That's all. So they are even beyond that. So they are, the whole mood is simply out of love, they are serving Krishna. They are in Krishna Prema. That's the stage. We have to, we have to follow in their footsteps. That is the standard that Prabhupada has given us and that's what we have to. If we simply follow the instructions of Srila Prabhupada, if we study his books properly and understand Prabhupada's mood, just like I was explaining the poem that Prabhupada has written, so if you understand Prabhupada's mood and follow that, we will be, we will be following the footsteps of the Brajavasis. Because Prabhupada has given us the ultimate thing, nothing beyond this. There is nothing over and above what Prabhupada has given. Simply we follow Prabhupada's instructions, read his books nicely and, and understand that Prabhupada's mood, then we will, we will, actually Prabhupada is giving us residence in Goloka Vrindavan. Not even Vaikuntha Loka, not in any of the other spiritual planets. He is giving us opportunity to go back to the, to Goloka Vrindavan itself. That is the, that is what actually Prabhupada has given us. It is the ultimate that Prabhupada has given us. We can never, we can never appreciate enough the, the glory of what Prabhupada has given us.

#### Accepting service from authority, Surrender to Srila Prabhupada, Flaws in surrender

**Key Quote:** "It all depends on the extent of surrender that we are having towards Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** In response to a final question, the speaker explains that accepting whatever service is assigned to one as coming from Srila Prabhupada requires a lot of surrender, and that any flaws or defects we see in the services or management are actually resulting from a flaw in ourselves and our surrender.

Yes please. Final question. Prabhu just wanted to know if, can one take for granted that whatever service comes from authority is perfect? You see, to be able to accept whatever service is assigned to one, as coming from Srila Prabhupada, requires a lot of surrender. If one is sufficiently advanced in Krishna Consciousness and one has surrendered sufficiently to the spiritual master, whatever service is allocated to one, that is actually it will be coming from Prabhupada. Because if you see, in that sense, what is this institution? This institution is set up by Srila Prabhupada. And Srila Prabhupada is giving instructions to all of us through a certain system that he has set up. There is a temple president, there is a temple commander, etc., etc. There is a hierarchy that is set up in the institution. And Prabhupada set this up to disseminate his instructions. So, if, actually, the, the, any flaw or any defect that we may see in the services or in the, in the, in the management of the temple actually is resulting from a flaw in ourselves. If we are flawed in our surrender, then to that extent, we will see flaws everywhere. We will see defects. If we are surrendered to the extent that we are able to appreciate whatever, this is a system that Prabhupada has set up, therefore whatever is coming in this, I accept as coming from Prabhupada. The service that is being allocated to me is coming to me from Prabhupada through this system, then actually what happens is it becomes direct service to the spiritual master. It is as good as Prabhupada directly calling you and telling, this is your service, please do it. So, the, it all depends on the extent of surrender that we, that we are having towards Srila Prabhupada. That is the whole point. So, it's as simple as that.

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of whether only full-time devotees can achieve Krishna consciousness, arguing that it's possible regardless of one's material circumstances, using Bhaktivinoda Thakur as an example.

This is the question: In Kali Yuga, is it only possible for a full-time devotee to attain Krishna consciousness until death, where we can remember Krishna at the time of death? That's not true. The point is that if we look at the example of great Acharyas like Bhaktivinoda Thakur, he was engaged in government service, but still he was Krishna conscious. Of course, he is a pure devotee, he is a great Acharya, we cannot compare with our own condition. But Bhaktivinoda Thakur, by his example, he established that no matter what condition we are in, we can

**Key Quote:** "Whatever we do, we have to surrender to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing the importance of surrendering all activities to Krishna, regardless of one's material status or engagement, as activity is inherent to the soul.

become Krishna conscious. We can remain in pure devotional service irrespective of what material engagement we have. So Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita, yad karośi, yad aśnāsi, yad juhośi, dadāsi, yad tapasya sikaunte, yad kurusva madharpanam, whatever we do, we have to surrender to Krishna. And that's why we have to give up our devotional service. Sthane sthitaha. Sthane sthitaha, wherever, whatever material situation we are in, we need not give it up. If we are able to give it up and dedicate ourselves fully to our spiritual master's mission, that's the best thing, definitely. But if due to some commitments, some considerations, some opposition, we are unable to dedicate ourselves, still in whatever condition we have, it's not possible to give up. So we are not able to give up our devotional service, we are not able to give up our spiritual service, we are in, we can render devotion and service to Krishna, we can remain Krishna conscious, and at the time of death, by the mercy of the Guru, by the mercy of a pure devotee, spiritual master, which is Srila Prabhupada, by his mercy we will be able to remember Krishna and go back to Godhead. So remembering Krishna at the time of death and going back to Godhead is not dependent upon my status. My status as a full-time devotee, congregation devotee, folk devotee, Grihastha, Brahmachari, Sanyasi, these are all material considerations, material situations. According to our body, according to the circumstances, we may take up a certain status or position in life because everyone has to have some, the material world is such that you have to have some status. Either as a man or as a woman. Either as a married person or as a bachelor or as a full-time devotee or working outside. You have to do something.

**Key Quote:** "When we start attributing the result to ourselves, then you are on the material platform."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while activity is essential, attributing the results of actions to oneself keeps one on the material platform, and receiving the mercy of Guru and Krishna is what truly matters for liberation.

Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that the nature of the living entity is to be active. And therefore Krishna says, "You cannot remain inactive because if you are inactive you cannot even maintain your body." So activity is the characteristic of the soul; the soul cannot remain inactive. Now, in what capacity he acts in the material world, as a Brahmachari, as a Grihastha, as a folk boy, as a congregation devotee, as a full-time missionary, whatever activities you do, in whatever condition, you have to situate yourself somewhere and carry out some activity. You cannot remain inactive. The point is, what do we do with the result of those activities? If I am a full-time missionary, then I cannot remain inactive. If I am a full-time missionary, but I am thinking, "Oh, this activity I am doing, because of this so much, this one result is coming is all because I have worked hard for it. I worked hard, therefore so much donation came to the temple. I worked hard, so many people became devotees of Krishna." When we start attributing the result to ourselves, then you are on the material platform. So, to whom do we attribute the result? No matter in what condition we are in, no matter what status we are in, no matter what is our field of activity, that actually determines whether we receive the mercy of Guru and Krishna and we are able to remember Krishna at the time of death and we are able to become free from the cycle of birth and death and go back to Krishna Loka or not.

**Key Quote:** "It is the consciousness of that individual which determines whether it goes back to Godhead or not."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes that while being a full-time devotee is conducive to Krishna consciousness, ultimately it is one's consciousness and surrender to Krishna that determines whether one returns to Godhead.

So it's not a matter of being a full-time devotee or not, it's a matter of receiving the mercy of Guru and Krishna. Guru is Srila Prabhupada and Krishna himself. And if we have the opportunity and the chance to dedicate ourselves to Krishna, our life, to Prabhupada's mission, to our Guru Maharaj's mission, then there is a very high degree of chance that every activity that we do, we will be able to surrender the result to Krishna. So the situation becomes more favorable when we are a full-time devotee, but ultimately it is the consciousness of that individual which determines whether it goes back to Godhead or not. So this is the fundamental point which we have to always keep in mind. Otherwise, being a full-time missionary, yes, is more definitely far more conducive to be able to practice Krishna consciousness and to be able to come to the point of remembering Krishna all the time, which will help us to remember Krishna even at the time of death and take us back to Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of whether modern science accepts reincarnation, stating that opinions vary among scientists and that belief in science doesn't preclude belief in God, as they are different fields of knowledge.

I believe in reincarnation. Does modern science accept it or not? Modern science, well, it ranges from 0 to 100. There are people in science who don't believe in reincarnation. There are people who believe somewhere in between. There are people who believe totally in reincarnation. So we have all kinds of people. It's not that if you are a believer in science, you cannot be a believer in God. It's not like that, because both are different branches of knowledge. It's like asking, does someone who believes in physics really believe in mathematics? Or someone who believes in mathematics really believe in biology? Both are different branches of knowledge, so you cannot compare both of them. But yes, there are people who believe in God. There are people who believe in science who don't believe in reincarnation, don't believe in the existence of soul, etc. And there are many scientists, Nobel laureates, those who have achieved a lot in the field of chemistry, science, physics, etc. There are many people like that who believe that there must be a higher being behind this creation. There must be a higher intelligence behind this creation.

**Key Quote:** "And all the living entities are trying to control the material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of material and spiritual energies according to the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting the distinction between matter and the living entity that seeks to control it.

So we go by, see, the point is that science deals with matter, material energy. According to the understanding of the Bhagavad Gita, Apareyam itas tv anyam prakritim viddhi me param, Krishna says, First of all, there is, First of all, Krishna says, there is one energy of his, which is called the differentiated energy or the interior energy. And this interior energy of Krishna, it consists of earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intelligence and falsity. These eight elements constitute the interior energy of Krishna. Apareyam itas tv anyam prakritim viddhi me param jiva-bhutam maha-baho yedam dharyate jagat. And then Krishna says, the entire material energy that we see comprises different combinations of these eight elements. Whether you look at a human body, animal body, tree body, earth, planets, different planets, all of them comprise these fundamental eight elements in varying proportions, varying forms, etc. But Krishna says, beyond this, there is a higher energy, superior energy of mind, which is called the living entity, jiva-bhutam yedam dharyate jagat. And all the living entities are trying to control the material energy. You see how Krishna has beautifully put it. If you analyze this material, entire material manifestation also, you have matter, which is what scientists are all studying. Then there is the scientist who studies that matter, who wants to control all that matter by studying it. There are two distinct things, isn't it? One is matter itself. Then there is the person who is trying to harness material energy, control it, use it according to his purposes.

**Key Quote:** "They say that no, living force is also part of the material energy. Some point of time, when the chemicals mix together, consciousness is produced."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the scientific view that consciousness arises from material interactions and contrasts it with the Vedic perspective, using the example of AI development to illustrate the point.

So Krishna brings this distinction out, and he says, both of them are different energies. Even the living entity is also energy of Krishna. Many scientists, of course, they do not accept that living force is a separate energy. They say that no, living force is also part of the material energy. Some point of time, when the chemicals mix together, consciousness is produced. That's all. And so that's why they are saying very quickly, we will produce sentient AI. And once we are there, we have produced life. Okay. Sentient AI already to some extent, they have already done. If you look at, if you go to Google, there is an option, Google Lens. You take a picture of something and put it into Google. It will search and bring out all the information related to it. Just the other day, somebody was asking us, if you see next to our compound wall, there are a lot of trees. There are those big, big fruits coming from the tree hanging down. So somebody asked, there must be some use for this fruit. So much of it is hanging down. Why are you not using it? So I immediately pulled out my mobile, took a picture and searched and found out that the fruit is poisonous, so you cannot use it. So I said, see, it is here. So you see, vision, form, identifying form. Our sight is what? Our power of sight is to identify forms and to be able to discriminate and determine. Okay. This form belongs to that of a speaker. This is the form of a fan. This is the form of a TV. We see the form and identify what the object is, what its functions are, right? Similarly, AI is doing that. You capture a photograph. It will give you all information, what it is all about. So power of sight is already there, right? And power of sound is already there. Now, latest thing is you hum a tune. Some song is running in your mind. You are remembering the tune, but you have forgotten the song. You hum a tune into your mobile and search, it will search out that song and tell you. I don't know whether you have used that feature. So even sound, it is able to, and also we are able to see that Siri and in Google also, there is one lady. You speak to her and tell, call this person. It will immediately, she will immediately call. You ask for directions, she will show from where to where, how to go. So sound also is recognizing. And you can dictate. Now it has become part of all softwares. Word, MS word you open, olden days we had to sit and type. Now we are all from that dinosaur age. So we are, you know, automatically tuned to open a word file and start typing. But now you don't have to do that. Open a word file and start dictating, whichever language you want. You dictate in Tamil, it will type in Tamil. You dictate in Hindi, it will type in Hindi. You dictate in English, it will type in English. So sound also it has got recognized.

**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing AI, focusing on the senses it lacks and arguing that even sentient AI cannot replicate human consciousness, free will, or the ability to discriminate between right and wrong.

So AI, now what is pending in AI? One is smell, and second is touch, right? And so we have sight, taste, smell, taste, sound, taste, smell, taste, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, taste, taste, and touch. These are the three things AI still not done, and they will reach there also. You take one specific agarbatti, light it and bring it near the sensor. It will identify and tell you which fragrance it is. So that also they may be able to do it. If at all it is just a sensor that you have to develop. Similarly, taste also. I don't know how they are going to do it. Feed a rasgulla to that AI and it will tell you what has been noticed. Eat. Do not do anything. Eat. Don't ask for sleeping habit. You what the taste it is eventually it may be possible to do that also but by so you have you have developed a sentient AC AI already partially a is sentient if you bring in these three more senses than fully sentient air but does that constitute a conscious living being capable of taking decisions processing desires processing the power of discrimination differentiating what is the right and wrong those things will not exist whatever you the way you program that AI it will respond accordingly somebody has has you know inputted into the air program the AI to give all atheistic responses we wait these things somebody some Krishna conscious devotee if he makes an AI to give all Krishna conscious answers possible no we all know how AI works now it's all biased there's no non biased AI so it will have no what do you say it has no intention or desire of its own whereas a human being possesses those faculties so desiring consciousness

**Summary:** The speaker argues that AI, being an imitation created by intelligent beings, cannot prove that original life arose spontaneously from chemicals, emphasizing the need for intelligence in creation.

decision-making, these cannot be replicated by AI. So you can call it sentient AI, but it is still artificial intelligence. It's not going beyond that. So you see people get carried away by this kind of imitations. After all, ultimately what is the experience? It is imitating, mimicking human intelligence, that's all, you know. So we are using our human intelligence and mimicking, imitating original intelligence. So AI is created, you did not come up with that. That is no off佐 so we all gotta communicate Napoleon about it that is looping in the air modificationsμε is created by us, it is created by an intelligent human being. So to create an imitation, you need a living person. So how can you say that the original has come into existence on its own, that it has come about just by a combination of chemicals? So AI also you, you know, allow chemicals to combine and form AI. Why it is not happening? It will not happen. So you see, anything that we have to create requires intelligence. Creating some meaningful object cannot happen without intelligence. Some by chance some chemicals came together and created a beautiful object, not possible. So meaningful objects can be created only when you have a person behind it, and that person cannot be created by a combination of chemicals. So the person is beyond the ordinary or intelligent physical form

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the Vedic perspective of distinct material and spiritual energies, highlighting the superiority of spiritual energy due to its consciousness and the easily observable difference between a living person and a dead body.

called material energy. This is the way the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedic scriptures approach the world around us, that there are two distinct separate energies. Both are energies. One is material energy, another is spiritual energy. Spiritual energy is superior because it is trying to control and manipulate the inferior material energy. Why is one called the inferior and the other called superior? Because the superior energy has got the controlling tendency and manipulating tendency, whereas the other energy does not have. The spiritual energy, the superior energy has consciousness, therefore it is superior. Material energy cannot possess consciousness at any point of time, therefore it is inferior. So this is how we have to see distinctly, you know, any person with common sense can make out this distinction. There is a distinct difference between a living person and dead matter. And that is why very simple example, as long as we are alive, we look at each other and call each other by names. We go to a hospital, they will ask for the medical record and they will say so and so person is getting treated here and all that. And suppose a person goes to the hospital and he dies in the hospital. What happens? The doctor will come and tell, please take the dead body and go. They will not tell the name of the person because no more, that person is no more, that person is gone. Only body has been left behind. Very simple, no, what is the difference between a living person and a dead body? It is the person who is there within the body. So it's very common sense. It doesn't require much, very great intelligence

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes scientists who are blinded by the allure of material advancements, preventing them from seeing the simple truth of reincarnation and the limitations of material explanations for life.

to understand this. But unfortunately, scientists, although they are apparently very intelligent, they are not able to see even this simple truth. That is why Krishna refers to them in the Bhagavad Gita as mayaya apahrta-jnana. Their knowledge has been snatched away by the glamour, the glitter of material energy. They will invent one AI and they will say, we are almost there. We are going to create sentient air. We have, we have figured out how to create light. And they go on like this, like this. They will, you know, they will die. Their sons will come. They will also die. Their grandchildren will come. They will also die. Each of them will keep telling the people of their generation, we are almost there. We have figured it out. Don't worry. And life will go on. Death will go on. Business of science will also go on like this. So we should not get carried away by the glitter of the material energy. That's the whole thing. If you are carried away by the glitter of material energy, how much science and technology has had to do with it, how much science has advanced, what all discoveries have happened. So when you look at all those things, yes, we will be able to figure out what are the chemicals bringing about consciousness and life. This is how maya covers the intelligence of the living entity. This is called the avarana-atmika shakti of maya. Material energy, although it is inferior, it has the ability to blind us with her glitter, promising something in the future. In the future, we are going to find out. In the future, we are going to be able to create, recreate life. So these kinds of false assurances are given to us by maya which covers our intelligence and we are unable to see the simple stark reality.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that some scientists, less influenced by illusion, can recognize the existence of God and a higher intelligence beyond human efforts, acknowledging the diversity of beliefs within the scientific community.

This is what the Vedic scriptures are pointing out. So it doesn't matter. Amongst the scientists, those who are mayapahrta-jnana, their intelligence has been stolen away by maya, will not be able to see how reincarnation is happening. Whereas those who are not completely bewildered by that illusory energy will be able to see the truth. That's why among scientists, you will see some of them are definitely, they believe in God. There are many others who don't believe in God. So many scientists will say, religion is all not required. We should remove religion. And there in his row, one scientist will be releasing one satellite and before that he'll be going and doing one Ganesha puja. So you have both varieties, because ultimately human beings, human beings, some people whose intelligence is not so much covered will be able to see that beyond our efforts and beyond our intelligence, there is a higher intelligence and we are dependent on that. So that's how things are.

### AAQ: How do we not Overthink, Over Analyze | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

**Key Quote:** "Faith is common for any acquisition of knowledge, whether biology, botany, chemistry, physics, mathematics, any branch of knowledge if you want to acquire, faith is common."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of overthinking and argues that faith is essential for acquiring any knowledge, including scientific knowledge, drawing parallels between accepting scientific principles and accepting scriptural teachings.

Interesting question. How do we not overthink or overanalyze? How to avoid overthinking and overanalyzing? Well, if we look at the Vedic scriptures, if we look at the Bhagavad Gita, faith is given a very important role to play in acquisition of knowledge. Now of course, in the modern day, faith is given a very, you know, it is treated as a very contemptuous thing. All religions are all fakes. Leave it aside. Science is real knowledge. That's the way it is presented. It is true that to acquire spiritual knowledge, you need faith. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that ashraddha dana, those who are unfaithful, those who do not have faith, they will have neither peace in this life nor in the next one. So to be able to acquire spiritual knowledge, faith is very important. But then to acquire science also faith is required. All of us, we learn science. How? By going to the school and college, sitting in a classroom and studying the textbook. Whatever the textbook is teaching, we accept it as truth. We say to water, consciousness, there are two molecules of water. All of us have done it. How many of you have actually taken out water and analyzed how many atoms of hydrogen, how many atoms of oxygen are there? How many of you have done it? None of us have done it. True, no? But if anybody asks any one of us, what is the composition of water? What is the chemical composition of water? H2O. Immediately answer will come. Where did you get this H2O from? What is hydrogen in the first place? What is oxygen? Oxygen, can you separate it out and show it to me? If you can you show it to me, where is oxygen? Show me. Can you show me? Not possible. Can you show me hydrogen? Not possible. Can you show me God? Not possible. So can you show me God? I cannot show you God because you cannot see. So God does not exist. You cannot show me hydrogen, how should I accept that hydrogen exists? You are telling periodic table you are showing and all those things. Very fine. All right. That table anybody can make. Even a child can sit and make. So just because you made it and you put it in the textbook, I have to accept. So when you teach from a book, we have to accept it blindly. I have faith. This is a science book. Accept it. That's all. When it comes to same Bhagavad Gita, that is also a book. No, no, no, it is faith. Faith is common for any acquisition of knowledge, whether biology, botany, chemistry,

**Key Quote:** "So that faith in an authorized source of knowledge is essential for acquiring knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of having faith in an authorized source of knowledge, comparing the process of learning science from authorized textbooks and professors to acquiring spiritual knowledge from authorized scriptures.

physics, mathematics, any branch of knowledge if you want to acquire, faith is common. But not blind faith. Faith in an authorized source of that knowledge. Why we have faith in the science books? Because the science books are being taught in an authorized college, by an authorized professor. We are not going to some sabjeevala and learning what is the components of water, what is the chemical composition of water. We are not going to some street vendor who is illiterate and learning from him, right? We are going to an authorized college and authorized professor and authorized textbooks we are studying and we are learning from that. So that faith in an authorized source of knowledge is essential for acquiring knowledge. So that faith in an authorized source of knowledge is essential for acquiring knowledge. Any branch of knowledge without that faith, fundamental faith, nobody can acquire any knowledge. This is the reality. So, similarly, in for acquiring spiritual knowledge also, you have to have faith in the authorized source of that spiritual knowledge. So, just like we have textbooks which are prescribed by the university which are called authorized sources of knowledge, material knowledge, But similarly, for acquiring spiritual knowledge, the authorized books are Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures. So if we acquire knowledge from them, we will be able to, we will, if we have faith in those authorized books of spiritual knowledge, we will be able to acquire spiritual knowledge. And just like in the science books, first you have faith in the college and the teacher and the textbook, go and sit in the classroom, hear the theory, then you go to the lab and conduct the experiment. You will be able to see for yourself how the theory is correct, yes or no? But for you to conduct that experiment also, first you should have faith that yes, college is authorized, textbook is authorized, this knowledge being taught to me is authorized. If you have no faith, hey, this is all bogus, yeah, you will never acquire any knowledge. So with that faith, you first go and learn the theory. Then you go to the lab and do the practical experiments. Then whatever you learned in theory gets validated, our faith in that source of knowledge becomes stronger. This is the phenomenon which is working in science also.

**Key Quote:** "You have faith in the authorized scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, and you study that and apply those principles in your life, you will be able to see the results which are predicted."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that just as scientific theories are validated through experiments, spiritual knowledge is validated by applying scriptural principles in one's life, leading to stronger faith.

Same thing, same principle works even for spiritual knowledge also. You have faith in the authorized scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, and you study that and apply those principles in your life, you will be able to see the results which are predicted. In the end, you will be able to see the results which are predicted in the Bhagavad Gita and in the Vedic scriptures. And if you do that, so what happens? You are validating, you are applying the principles, practically you are applying them in the laboratory of your life. In the, to study science, the laboratory for you is some classroom within the college or school. In the case of spiritual knowledge, the laboratory is yours. You apply, you experiment. By applying those spiritual principles in your life, you will be able to see the results. You are validating, you are doing studies according to those spiritual principles in your life, and you validate whatever is told in the Vedic scriptures, that way your faith grows. So, when we speak of any branch of knowledge, we need to have faith in that branch of knowledge. Without that, we cannot acquire any system of knowledge. So, when we speak of overthinking or overthinking, then it is not worth knowing the knowledge at all. One must never wax and notice Hay жеä président intrigued and known all his deviations andmm eternal. One must never lose attention to knowledge all the time. Without it, one cannot, we cannot acquire any system of knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "So the root cause of overthinking and over analysis is what lack of sufficient faith."
**Summary:** The speaker connects overthinking and overanalyzing to a lack of faith in the source of knowledge, suggesting that once the authenticity of a source is established, its teachings should be accepted.

Stanugen was an lett definition of artificial intelligence. analyzing what it simply means is we are not having sufficient faith in the source of knowledge so if you have faith in that source of knowledge if you have done a little bit of analysis and determined for yourself that yes i accept that this is a bona fide source of knowledge then you don't after that analyze whether this source what the source is saying is correct or not you accept that whatever is coming from the thoughts is correct so then we have we become free from overthinking and over analyzing but if all our life we keep questioning the source then we will never be able to acquire knowledge same thing you go to college first you determine college has certain registration accreditation it has got a recognition you analyze all those things and then you look at who are the professors what are their qualifications and how many years they have been teaching so you analyze all this and come to a conclusion yes this college is authorized after that you get into the college admit yourself in the college then whatever they teach you have to accept this accept it as school right now after admission three years you are in the college still you are researching is this college authorized or not and then why are in the college via this is called over analysis and working so we have to learn to place faith after an initial assessment of the of the authenticity of the source of our knowledge once we have determined that this source of knowledge is authentic whatever comes from there we have to accept it as

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the need to obtain spiritual knowledge from the right source, referring to the disciplic succession stemming from Krishna as presented in the Bhagavad Gita.

then we will become free from overthinking and over analysis so the root cause of overthinking and over analysis is what lack of sufficient faith so we have to learn to develop faith if we and that development of faith comes from the determination of the authenticity of the source of knowledge so therefore it is important that is why krishna also tells in the bhagavad-gita attaining this spiritual knowledge should be obtained from the right source what is the right source right source is how do you determine what is the right source for spiritual knowledge that has to come in a bona fide parampara and that is why prabhupada has given him towards the end of the introduction of the bhagavad-gita the unbroken chain of discipleship succession stemming from krishna himself krishna gave this knowledge to brahma brahma gave it to narada narada gave to vyasa dev vyasa dev gave it to madhavacharya like that prabhupada is the 32nd in the line of discipleship success like that prabhupada is the 32nd in the line of disciples so the criterion for the criterion for reposing our faith in the source of knowledge is given in the Bhagavad Gita and we use that criterion and we repose our faith in the Bhagavad Gita and then we will be able to take advantage of the knowledge in that.

**Key Quote:** "So, devotional life, Bhakti Yoga is such that it is the means as well as the end."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that in spiritual life, the long-term and short-term goal is the same: service to Krishna and Vaishnavas through chanting and serving Prabhupada's mission, emphasizing that devotional service is both the means and the end.

How can I achieve my long-term and short-term goal through spiritual practice? This is the next question. You see, now it all depends on what is your goal. Is your goal material or is it spiritual? If it is spiritual, how to achieve your long-term and short-term goals? Long-term and short-term goal in spiritual life is only one: service to Krishna and service to Vaishnavas. So, we chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. We serve the mission of Prabhupada. That's the short-term as well as long-term goal. Life after life, we want to be engaged in the service of the mission of Srila Prabhupada. Life after life, we want Srila Prabhupada as our Diksha Guru and want to follow his instructions. And we want to chant Hare Krishna. We want to never forget Krishna's holy name. This is the short-term goal. This is the long-term goal. So, devotional life, Bhakti Yoga is such that it is the means as well as the end. The means to perfect yourself spiritually, to achieve spiritual perfection in Bhakti Yoga is to chant Hare Krishna. And after perfection, what is it that you are going to do? What is it that you are going to achieve? You will chant Hare Krishna. That's all. So, devotional service is both the means as well as the end.

**Key Quote:** "Because human life is not meant to work towards results."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritual goals with material goals, arguing that focusing solely on achieving material results is a regressive way of thinking, leading away from the true purpose of human life.

Now, if you are talking about material goals, short-term, long-term goals, how to achieve through spiritual practice? Well, you see, this focus on achieving a certain goal, first have a goal in life, work towards it, achieve it. This is a very recent and very, what you say, regressive kind of thinking in the human society. It's not a progressive thinking. Why regressive? Because when we speak of goal, that means we have to have a result in mind. What is it that I want to achieve? So, all your activities become result-oriented. All your decisions in life will be result-oriented. Today's world people say, yes, we have to be result-oriented. Yes, that is the way to me. We have to focus. We have to have a goal. We have to work towards it, hard work, etc. But according to the Vedic scriptures, it is not a progressive way of life. Because if we focus too much on the goal that we want to achieve, we will be slipping from the human form of life into animal form of life and lower species of life.

**Key Quote:** "Better than working towards the result is to work for duty."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of duty over being result-oriented, stating that Vedic civilization prioritizes performing one's duty above achieving specific goals.

Because human life is not meant to work towards results. Better than working towards the result is to work for duty. That we also know in the material world. I mean, even in today's society, little bit of still, there is some respect for duty. Somebody wants to achieve a certain goal. I want to make a lot of money. And he doesn't take care of his parents. He doesn't bother about his family. Only focuses on to earn money. What will you say? He is a good guy? Isn't it? He should take care of his parents. Okay, we can have a goal. But some things are there. Some duties are there. You cannot give up. How can you give up your parents? How can you give up your family? So, you see, having a duty is considered higher than simply working for a goal. So, in the Vedic civilization, focus is not on the goal or on the result you are going to achieve.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Focus is on doing one's duty."
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the concept of duty in Vedic times through the example of teachers who prioritized imparting knowledge based on a student's qualification and character rather than monetary compensation, highlighting the importance of Guru Dakshina as an expression of gratitude.

Focus is on doing one's duty. The best example of this is Dronacharya. Dronacharya was a teacher. And his duty was to teach any eligible, qualified candidate if he comes. That's the duty of the teacher to teach. And in the Vedic times, teachers would not work for money. They would not say, give me a certain piece, then I will teach you. Today's world, teaching means only qualification required is you have to have money to pay the teacher. You have money to pay the teacher, college, whatever, you will get educated. That's the only thing. No other consideration is there. But in the Vedic times, money was never in the picture. The teacher will never ask for money. Teacher will assess, is the student qualified to receive this knowledge and will he use this knowledge properly. If yes, then the teacher will teach him even if he doesn't get any fees in return. And after receiving the knowledge, the student will not just walk away. Today's world, what others? Go to college, get educated, convocation will be there, go, take a degree, walk out after that, you are not bothered. You will not even remember the name of your teacher. But in the Vedic times, it is not like that. If you have received knowledge, then the student at the end of it, although teacher is not asking for any fees, it is the duty of the disciple to give some Guru Dakshina. Dakshina means it is whatever it is possible for you, you give. It is not a fee. It is a Dakshina. From my side, I am giving according to what level of gratitude I feel and what is possible for me, what is my capacity, I am giving. So it is Guru Dakshina. So the student has to give. Guru Dakshina, he cannot come away empty handed. So the teacher also, whatever possible for you, give. I give like that.

**Key Quote:** "Dronacharya thought, what is my duty in this circumstance?"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Dronacharya teaching Drishtadyumna, who was destined to kill him, to exemplify the principle of performing one's duty impartially, even when faced with potential negative consequences.

So Dronacharya was approached by Drishtadyumna. Who is this Drishtadyumna? Drishtadyumna was the son of Drupada. And Drupada had some fight with Dronacharya. And Drupada had conducted a yajna to beget a son who would kill Drona. And that is how Drishtadyumna was born. So Drishtadyumna was born to kill Dronacharya. And this Drishtadyumna comes to Dronacharya and says, I want to learn the art of archery from you. I want to learn Dhanur Vidya from you. And what does Dronacharya do? Dronacharya says, yes, I will teach him. Dronacharya knows very well that Drishtadyumna is born to kill him. So if Dronacharya were to be result oriented, what he will think? If I teach him, what is the result? I will kill him. So I will not teach him. Correct knowledge. That is the common sense. Anybody in today's world, he will think like that. And you cannot fault him. But Dronacharya did not think like that. Dronacharya thought, what is my duty in this circumstance? I am a teacher. He is a qualified student seeking knowledge. I cannot deny him. I will teach him. So impartially he taught Drishtadyumna also along with the Pandavas and Kauravas. So duty.

**Key Quote:** "The higher than being a result oriented worker is to be a duty oriented worker."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Duryodhana's result-oriented approach with the Pandavas' duty-oriented approach in the Mahabharata, highlighting that the Kurukshetra war was a Dharma Yudha because the Pandavas followed Dharma while Duryodhana did not.

In Vedic civilization, duty was the foremost. If you look at Duryodhana, Duryodhana was result oriented. I want the kingdom. Somehow I have to get the kingdom. Either cheat, fight, do whatever, get the kingdom. Result oriented. Pandavas, duty oriented. We will do our duty. Whatever our duty requires of us, we will. Result is immaterial. So Duryodhana cheated and got the kingdom. Pandavas also could have cheated and kept the kingdom. But they said, no, we will not cheat. We will do our duty as a Kshatriya. We have lost the game of dice. We have won in Vannavasa and Ajnatavasa. We will do it. So they were like that. So in Vedic civilization, the whole fight of the Kurukshetra happened. Why? Because Duryodhana was result oriented. Pandavas were duty oriented. That is why it was a Dharma Yudha. Because Duryodhana was not following Dharma. Pandavas were following Dharma. So the higher than being a result oriented worker is to be a duty oriented worker.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Focus is not on the goal or on the result you are going to achieve."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that following duty according to Varnashrama Dharma and Sanatana Dharma is superior to simply fulfilling duties related to one's livelihood, emphasizing the importance of duties towards other living entities, Devatas, Rishis, and the performance of Yajna, Dana, and Tapasya.

And in duty oriented work also, following the duty according to the Varnashama Dharma, Sanatana Dharma given in the Vedic scriptures, that is even better than executing duty according to our understanding in today's world. I have to go to office on time. I have to work 8 hours. I have to do my whatever assigned tasks are there. That is one level of duty. But according to Varnashama Dharma, I have to situate myself in a particular Varna and Ashrama and perform those duties. Those duties are not limited only to the office work. The duties extend not only to one's office or one's vocation, one's livelihood, but also to the other living entities, to other human beings, to the Devatas, to the Rishis and Sages, to even the animals in the society like cows and dogs and bulls and horses which from all these animals will take so much service. So there are duties to perform towards them also. And over and above all this, Yajna, Dana and Tapasya. There are duties towards sacrifice for the Devatas and for Vishnu. Then there is Dana, charity. One has to compulsorily give charity. That is one of the duties. If you are earning money, it is not that you have to put it in your bank and you have to enjoy. No. You have to also give Dana. That is also a charity. Charity is also a duty. And Tapasya. Not only that. You also have to undertake certain austerities. Tapasyas. You have to fast on Ekadashi. You have to fast on Janmashtami. You have to follow certain Pratas. So certain Tapasyas are also built in. So all these duties, if somebody follows, that is higher than simply doing duty according to one's livelihood.

**Key Quote:** "Your only duty should be to serve Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita (18.66) to emphasize that the highest form of duty is to give up all other duties and exclusively serve Krishna and the spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada, without concern for personal liberation or destination.

That is even higher. Now out of all the people who perform duties, according to the Varnashrama Dharma, those who give up all those duties, and make it their only duties to serve Krishna exclusively, he is even higher. That is why Krishna tells in the end of the Bhagavad Gita, here in chapter 66 verse, sarva dharman parityajya: Give up all other duties. sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: Surrender unto only me. Your only duty should be to serve Krishna. So the person who makes it the goal of his life and the existence of his life, his duty of his life is only exclusively serving Krishna. Serving Krishna means serving the duty of the spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada. So a person who does this, he is the topmost. Even there also there is no goal. There is no goal that we have to achieve. I have to go back to the garden. I have to achieve liberation. I should go to Vaikuntha. None of those things should be there. My only goal is my duty which is to serve Krishna and my Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada. That's all. Where I go, how many births I will take, whether I get liberated or not, none of my consideration.

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "That is where that sense of duty springs from."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the human form of life is unique because of the faculty to understand and perform duty, which involves self-restraint, sacrifice, and the willingness to do things that are not personally pleasing.

So that is the topmost. Development of the human intellect and human faculty. You can go up till there. Because only human beings have this faculty, you see, to think of duty. Animals have no sense of duty. That is why you don't have dharma for them. That you have to fast on Ekadashi. Can you go and tell your pet dog or pet cat, today is Ekadashi fast. You can forcibly make the cat or dog eat Ekadashi Prasastu. That's a difficult matter. But you know, it's not that the cat or dog is voluntarily following. No, we are voluntarily following. So that faculty to take tapasya, that faculty to sacrifice, that faculty to undertake certain austerities, the faculty to exercise self-restraint, is there only in the human form. So if you use that capability, that faculty in the human being, to do things which are not one's liking. I may like to do something, but I say, no, I will not do that. I will do something which is not very pleasing. If you ask me what I like to do, I like to eat when I feel hungry. But today is Janmasthami, I have to fast. So, although you would like to eat, you are ready to sacrifice that desire to eat and you are ready to fast. That faculty is there in the human being to do something, to give up something which you like to do and to do something which is not very pleasing. This faculty is there in the human being. And that is where that sense of duty springs from. In duty, what is there? Duty, you will do your duty even if it is not palatable, even if it is distressing. So, duty means you should be ready even if something, I have to do something, I have to do something which I don't like to do, I have to still do.

**Key Quote:** "That is the topmost development of the faculty."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the progression from basic duty to Varnashrama Dharma duty to exclusive service to Krishna and Guru as the highest development of human faculty, emphasizing that the ultimate goal is to serve the pleasure of Guru and Krishna without any other motivation.

That is called duty. So, you develop this faculty in the human being of self-restraint. You develop from the point of you know, doing your duty to doing varnashama dharma duty to rendering exclusive service to Krishna. That is the topmost development of the faculty. So, achieving long term, short term, goals is at the very bottom level. We have to progress far beyond that. We have to go to a certain level of sense of duty and in that also we have to go to duty towards varnashama dharma and finally duty towards guru and Krishna. That is the topmost decision. So, we should instead of thinking of short term, long term material goals, we should be thinking of when will I come to the stage where my only duty will be to serve Krishna and Guru. No other duty in my life. That is the real goal that we have to have. And how to achieve that? Very simple. Chant Hare Krishna, associate with devotees and render whatever practical devotional service you can. That chanting of Krishna's holy name and rendering service will gradually pull you towards that final destination of your devotional service, where you have no other motivation than to serve the pleasure of Guru and Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by encouraging listeners to chant Hare Krishna, associate with devotees, and render practical devotional service, explaining that the taste for Krishna will gradually lead them to the final destination of pure devotional service, emphasizing surrender to Krishna and Guru without concern for personal results.

So, rendering devotional service to Krishna is very powerful. We don't have to force ourselves. Oh no, I have to chant sixteen rounds. You don't have to do that. It's not a matter of force. We all begin, most of us, we begin by chanting one round, two rounds. Slowly we will make it four rounds. Slowly make it eight rounds. Then we will come to sixteen rounds. Isn't it? So, how does that happen? It's not that somebody is standing behind us with a stick. If you don't chant four rounds today, from today onwards I am going to beat you. Nobody did that. We automatically, we felt a taste for chanting. And we felt yes, I want to chant four rounds from today. Start chanting. So, the taste for Krishna is like that. Once you taste the devotional service, that devotional service will drag you until you come to the final point of your devotional service. So, simple thing. Read Prabhupada's books. Follow Prabhupada's instructions. Chant Hare Krishna. And you will achieve your long-term goal, which is to become a pure devotee of Krishna. That's the only result you can, you can desire. That also, it is dependent on the grace of Krishna and Buddha, whether they give award as pure devotional service or not. But as far as we are concerned, we want to serve our Guru's instructions and Krishna's instructions. That's a period. Whether we get Krishna Prema or not, whether I go to the spiritual world or not, whether I get liberated or not,

लो प्रो पोर्ग्राम I am for program आपका विद्धी वर्ष निश्चा ने आई था, बहुत कृपी रहा हुआ था, में वांट में आश्च रहा था, और इसमें उस स्थित्र के लिए आपके बाद बढ़ने बहुत रहा हुआ था. में एक बिल्ड थक गुड़ थे. ए, प्रभुजी, प्रभुजी. मैं कह दूसरा हूँ, वाला। क्या बिल्ड हूँ? आप वहां पहला पूंठते हैं। कूपका में बिल दे रहा है कि, हम उस संखित हल्पारों के बाद उसमें करने के लिए नहीं करने चाहिए। एक पटमा करना रखा गया था। एक योग उपसे बात करने की वजह नहीं जाना था। मेरे बास, हमें वह बहुत मुझे उपचार भूल्यया था। लेकिन शर्पद बिल्कुल नहीं बता सकता था। मेरी बहुत मास्ट पर एक पटमा ले गए। मैं बहुत खुश हूँ। किसी में मुझे देखेंगे, क्या हो जाएगा। दोस्तों, वहाँ देखेंगे, मोबाइल नहीं हुआ, किसी में पिक्चर देखेंगे और जोड़ेंगे। तो, आज वे वहाँ लिए आधे बजाएगी, आज आप नहीं कहेंगे। तो एक पारण में एक मैंसेज़ बढ़ाए गया। इन मुझे यहाँ पढ़ रहा था और मैं जब वहाँ पढ़ना चाहिए। उस परिणान कहा, उस चारे यहाँ पाठे जाएगा। I went, kept that in the corner, slowly started walking towards the door. Again, प्रभुजी, प्रभुजी! I said, now what? I said, where are you? He said, where are you going? There are so many more mats. I said, what, one mat is not enough? You want me to pick up more mats? अप्पा, it was such a, I tell you, it was a, you know, for my ego. Because all my life I have never done any menial work like that. Lived always like a prince, like a king, you know, there are always people to take care of washing the clothes and washing the dishes and all that. Never did any such thing in my life. So it was really, you know, it was really, it was like somebody is pushing me, very uncomfortable doing that and all that. But if that devotee had not done it that day, today I will not be sitting here. That's the reality. So I'm thankful to him that he broke through my false ego barrier and he pushed me to engage in service because of which today I'm here.

**Key Quote:** "So Maya will use false ego and tell us, why you are to do all these things? This is not meant for you. You are supposed to live like a king."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that false ego, influenced by Maya, prevents us from engaging in joyful service to Krishna, and that overcoming this requires pushing beyond our comfort zone with the help of other devotees.

So reality is, what is preventing us from rendering service to Krishna? Why are we feeling reluctant? Why are we feeling burdensome? Krishna actually says in the ninth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, सुसुकं कर्तुं अभ्ययं Devotional service to Krishna is very joyfully performed. So then if it is joyfully performed, when picking up the mat, why am I feeling so much, discomfort, so much embarrassment? Because false ego. Maya doesn't want us to engage in service to Krishna. Because if we engage in service, we'll get out of our clutches. So Maya will use false ego and tell us, why you are to do all these things? This is not meant for you. You are supposed to live like a king. What is all this, you know, picking up the mat, wiping the floor? No, no, no, no, no, no. These are all burdens. And you are engaging in spiritual life for this. I mean, you are an engineer, you have studied in so much, this one big college, you have got so much rank, this, that, and all that. All that for this? So these are the thoughts that will come to your mind and which will inhibit you, which will discourage you from doing service to Krishna. So at that time, some devotee has to come and push you. Baba, do know. So little by little, little by little, that barrier gets broken, broken, broken, broken. What will happen is eventually we'll become comfortable. We'll go beyond comfortable. We'll start loving to do that service. So this is how we have to be ready to go beyond our comfort zone. Then only we can expect to progress. No pain, no gain. The pain that you have to take in Krishna consciousness is the pain of overcoming our false ego, which always advises us against rendering service to Krishna. So therefore, if somebody is pushing you into services, you should not develop grudge against that devotee. You should be grateful to that devotee. You see my false ego, Maya is so strongly preventing me from doing service, but this devotee so mercifully, is pushing me to engage in service to Krishna. That is the way we should look at it.

**Key Quote:** "Mind, intelligence and false ego transfers us to another body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the process of reincarnation, emphasizing the role of the subtle body (mind, intelligence, and false ego) in carrying the soul to the next body.

So Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita that, within this very life, you can see that we are changing so many bodies. I gave up the body of a baby, got the body of a child, gave up the body of the child, got the body of a youth, gave up the body of the youth, got an old body, got a new body, got an old person's body, and finally when death comes, I will give up this body. So logically speaking, when in this life I have changed so many bodies, but I continue to exist. I didn't cease to exist. Body of the baby finished means I was not finished, I continued, right? So same logic, if you extrapolate, at the time of death, this body will cease to be, I will go on to another body. So when death comes, what happens? We are taken by our subtle body. Mind, intelligence, and false ego transfers us to another body. Actually, that's what has happened to us in this life also. When the body of the baby went away and we got the body of the child, we continue to feel I am the same person. And when we get a youthful body, we continue to feel I am the same person, although the body of the child and the baby is not there. Why? Because the same subtle body is continuing. Same mind, intelligence, and false ego is continuing. That is continuing uninterrupted. So for me, that feeling of I, I am this, doesn't cease. So we don't feel that I am changing the body, because although the gross body is changing, the subtle body is not changing. So the subtle body carries us from the body of the baby to the body of the child to the body of the youth to the body of the old person. Similarly, the subtle body will carry us from this body to the next body. So this cycle of birth and death goes on.

**Key Quote:** "Whenever a person is born, 100% guaranteed that that person will die."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the inevitability and painful nature of both birth and death, highlighting that both experiences are filled with suffering.

So Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita, jātasya dhruva mṛtyur. Whenever a person is born, 100% guaranteed that that person will die. Yes or no? Everybody accepts this. And Krishna says the reverse is also true. Jātasya dhruva mṛtyur janma mṛtasya ca. When a person dies, it is guaranteed that he is going to take another birth. So we are all caught up in this cycle of repeated birth and death. It's not a pleasurable thing to undergo birth and death. Death is a very, very painful experience. That's why nobody wants to die. Even an animal understands this. So if somebody, if a human being says, what is there? Death, you know, it's not a big thing. I am not afraid of death. That means he is duller than an animal. Even an animal understands death is very painful. That's why you try to cut the throat of an animal, it will shout, it will shriek, it will scream, it will try to run away. It will not give up so easily because even an animal knows death is very painful. So death is a very painful thing. Similarly, birth is also very painful. How are all of us born? We are all born crying, no? None of us are born, ahahaha, you know, laughing, you know, I had a wonderful experience, so joyful to take birth. Nobody takes birth like that, right? Everybody takes birth crying. It's extremely painful experience. The pain is so great. It's so painful, the process of birth.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the suffering inherent in the cycle of birth and death, including old age and disease.

And if you say, okay, momentarily, I have to undergo some pain for nine months, 10 months, I'm in the mother's womb, painful, but after I come out, over, no pain. And death, few seconds, it will be over. Okay. So, you know, birth, when I took birth, some pain I underwent, some suffering I underwent, 100 years I lived, happy. And at the end of my life, I was happy. And at the end of 100 years, death came, I had to struggle a little bit, no problem. No, sir, in between birth and death, two more things are there, old age and disease. That is also painful, no? One small fever comes also, it will be so depressing for us. We have to take medication, body will ache, there will be headache, eyes will be burning, nose will be burning. So many problems. We will not be able to digest proper food. Taste will go away. So it's painful. Disease is painful. And old age is also painful. All the joints will ache, there will be no energy in the body, you will not be able to walk, you cannot sit down, you cannot walk properly. So much trouble.

**Key Quote:** "So you see, in the midst of this birth and death, so many miseries we have to undergo."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the threefold miseries (adhibhautika, adhidaivika, and adhyatmika kleshas) that cause suffering in the material world.

And as if these four things are not enough, there are also three kinds of kleshas, adhibhautika klesha, adhidaivika klesha, and adhyakmika klesha. Adhidaivika klesha. Excessive redness. It is hair. Headaches. Empty brains. Floods. You built a house with great difficulty. You earned a lot of money, you did hard work, built a house, one flood will come, everything is swept away. Gone. Nobody has control over this. Supernatural occurrences. Distress, miseries which come on account of supernatural forces. Floods, earthquakes, extreme heat during summer, extreme cold during winter, all these things will create problems for us. Okay, all the rainy season got over, weather has become very nice and you know October, November season very, very pleasant weather. So things have become peaceful. No Adi Bhavathika Klesa. Immediately what will happen? There will be Adi Daivika Klesa is not there. Adi Bhavathika Klesa will start. Trump will announce H1B visa, $100,000 you have to pay and he will say 50% tariff I am putting exactly when Diwali is starting. So all your festival mood is all dampened. Arrey, I did not do anything to Trump. Why is he putting tariff on me? So other living entities will cause problems for you. And you will see when it is extreme heat during summer or extreme cold during winter, what will happen? You will be troubled by winter. The heat and the cold of the winter but there will be no mosquitoes. Weather becomes very good, immediately mosquitoes will start. One problem goes another will come. Adi Bhavathika Klesa. Other living entities will come and trouble us for no reason, for no fault of ours. And then there is Adhyatmika Klesa. Everything is fine, but my own mind will give me trouble. I will become depressed for no reason. Mood is not good today. I feel very grumpy today. You cannot help it, isn't it? Everybody around you is happy. You alone are feeling very, you know, very foul mood today. So everybody will start avoiding it. Today's mood is not okay. Don't go near it.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that understanding Krishna's transcendental nature can liberate one from the cycle of birth and death, leading to Krishna's abode.

and death, so many miseries we have to undergo. So an intelligent person will question, how can I get out of this cycle of birth and death and disease, old age, and these threefold miseries? What should I do? So if you want to do that, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, janma karma chamedivyam evam yojanati tatvatah, tyaktvadeham punarjanma naiti mameti sorjuna. Krishna says that if a soul takes the trouble to understand the position of Krishna, that Krishna, his birth, his activities, his qualities, these are all not material. Krishna's birth is not like my birth. Krishna doesn't have to undergo old age and disease like me. Krishna doesn't have to undergo Adhyatmika klesha, Adibhavitika klesha, Adidaivika klesha. Krishna is beyond all this. Simply to understand that Krishna is transcendent, his activities are transcendental, his birth is transcendental, his every quality is transcendental, simply by understanding this, Krishna says, punarjanma naiti, you don't have to take repeated birth and death in this material world. Then what will happen to us? Mameti, Krishna says, we will go to Krishna, we will go to Krishna loka. Just like we all live on this earth planet, Krishna has his own home, which is called Goloka Vrindavan. We will go there.

So, what happens to the troubles of birth, death, disease, old age, and the Adidaivika klesha, Adibhavitika klesha, Adhyatmika klesha, what about all these things? Krishna says that once you go to the spiritual world, that Goloka Vrindavan Vaikuntha, there is no more birth, death, disease, old age.

And if you follow the instructions of Krishna, then no more the problems of birth, death, disease, and old age. All right. So, the simple solution to this repeated birth and death is engaging in devotional service to Krishna. That's the simple thing.

### AAQ: Is Evil The Highest Ignorance? Does It Have a Form? | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

**Key Quote:** "The standard of what is evil, what is not evil, what is good, what is bad, all these things keep changing with time."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of whether evil is the highest degree of ignorance and argues that the definition of good and evil changes with time and societal norms, using examples like alcohol consumption and premarital relationships.

Is evil the highest degree of ignorance? Does evil have a personified form? Well, what constitutes being evil? We may have different concepts of what is evil and what is good. In the olden times, in the Vedic times, to consume alcohol, to have an illicit relationship outside of marriage between a man and a woman, this was considered sinful. To engage in gambling was considered sinful. Today the definition has changed. Man and woman, outside of marriage, they have a relationship, consensual, it's all fine. Who are we to interfere? It is their private matter. We see online so many betting apps and betting channels and so many things are going on. Even online, openly it is all being advertised. Come and play and gamble. Intoxication, I mean, who doesn't intoxicate now? So today all these things are not considered sinful. They are all considered normal, that's part of normal life. So, the standard of what is evil, what is not evil, what is good, what is bad, all these things keep changing with time.

**Key Quote:** "By today's standards, Ramana is a very good man."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Ravana's abduction of Sita to illustrate how perceptions of good and evil change over time, contrasting the severe punishment Ravana faced in Vedic times with the relatively lenient punishments for similar crimes today.

If you look at Ravana in his time, he was considered an evil man because he abducted Sita against her will and he imprisoned her. And when Ramachandra came to claim her back, he refused to return her and fought a battle to death with him. By today's standards, if you see, Ravana just abducted her, that's all. He didn't do anything else. So by today's standards, Ravana is a very good man. He was very honorable. He kept telling Sita Devi, marry me. He did not violate her in any other way. But in his time, what he did was evil. To abduct a woman against her will, he had to give up his life. So, in Vedic times, even abduction of a woman was considered so evil that anybody who would do that could be sentenced to death. That was the culture at that time. Today, you know, it's not a major thing. Somebody, even if he forces himself upon a woman, even if he rapes her, maximum the court will give some few years of imprisonment. After that, he is free. And that imprisonment also will come after decades of trial. So many years of trial, then Sessions Court, then the High Court, then the Supreme Court. Practically, by that time, the man who committed the crime will already be on his death bed. What is the use of all this sentencing? So in today's world, the maximum punishment that a man can get for violating a woman's modesty is a few years of imprisonment. That's all. It's not considered all that evil. Whereas, Ravana, just for abducting Sita, he had to give up his life.

**Key Quote:** "What is good at one time becomes bad at another. What is bad at one time becomes good at another time."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to argue that the definition of evil changes with time, citing examples of intoxication and live-in relationships, and how societal views on these topics have shifted over the years.

He was punished by taking his life. So, according to Shastra, Atataina, seven kinds of aggressors are there. One of them is one who abducts another's wife. He is considered an Atatain, aggressor. And all such aggressors can be given the death penalty. So, evilness is... The definition of evilness keeps changing with time, according to society's perception of what is right, wrong, changing cultures, societal norms, etc. Similarly, if you look at intoxication. A hundred years back in India, if anybody intoxicated, the whole society would look at him with abhorrence. Oh, this man is a drunkard. But today, it is a prestige matter to drink. You go to any rich man's house, there will be one section, a bar with all kinds of alcoholic drinks. It is prestigious to have. If you go to a rich man's house and there is no bar, then it looks very bad. What is this man? He is not even having a bar in his house. You can imagine. Today, the perception has changed. People's values have changed. That is why in Chaitanya Charitamrita, Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami says, This is good, this is bad. What we think this is good and this is bad in the material world is all Manodharma. It is all our mental concoction. According to the circumstances, we say this is good, this is bad. Some years later, our perception changes, our value system changes, our culture changes. We will say no. What we considered bad earlier, is actually good. And what we considered good till now is bad. A hundred years back, in India, if you spoke of live-in relationships, very bad. Marriage, good. Today, if you speak of marriage, very bad. Live-in relationship, very good. Changes. People's perception, people's value system changes. What is good at one time becomes bad at another. What is bad at one time becomes good at another time. So, there is this.

**Key Quote:** "All this consideration in the material world, everything is born of ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the concepts of good and bad in the material world are mental concoctions born of ignorance, using the analogy of wet and dry stool to illustrate that both are ultimately undesirable.

This keeps on changing. So, you cannot say what is permanently good and what is permanently bad. This is all because of our mental concoction. Prabhupada gives an example, just like wet stool and dry stool. If we say this is wet stool, this is bad. This is dry stool. Dry stool is good. Does it have any meaning? Wet stool, dry stool, all bad only. Similarly, This is good, this is bad. All this consideration in the material world, everything is born of ignorance. Though this, we are, somebody is helping other people, somebody is doing good to others, somebody is doing charity. Oh, these are all good things. Somebody is stealing, somebody is harming others, somebody is cheating others, these are all bad things. All good, bad is good. All good, bad, everything is bad only in the material world. Everything is born of ignorance only. We have created our own mano dharmas, our own dharmas, our own duties and what is right and wrong in this material world out of our own mental concoctions arising out of our bodily concept of life which is a result of our ignorance. So, it is not a matter of only evil being born of ignorance. Even whatever we think good is also born out of ignorance.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The only eternally good thing is surrendering unto Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes that only devotional service to Krishna is outside the realm of ignorance and that surrendering to Krishna is the only truly good thing, contrasting it with the ever-changing and ultimately ignorant notions of good and evil in the material world.

Only devotional service to Krishna is outside the purview of ignorance. Therefore, Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita, sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. Give up all other types of concocted duties. Simply surrender unto me, Krishna says. This means surrendering to Krishna is the only really good thing, the only really thing which is arising out of enlightenment. That is why Krishna also tells in the Bhagavad Gita. What does Krishna say? Krishna says that bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan, meaning a person who is in knowledge, one who has cultivated spiritual knowledge for many many lifetimes. bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate vasudevaha sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah. If you are really not in ignorance, if you are really in jnana, knowledge, then you should be surrendering to Krishna saying that Krishna is everything. If I serve Krishna, then all other duties are fulfilled. If I don't surrender to Krishna, no matter whether I am evil or good in the eyes of the material people, it is all ignorance. Alright. So therefore, it's not a matter of evil being the highest degree of ignorance. The ignorance is our non-surrendering to Krishna. Non-submission to Krishna is ignorance. Rest, good, evil, bad, all these things, it's all changing from time to time. There is no set standard. There is no eternally good, eternally evil thing. The only eternally good thing is surrendering unto Krishna. That's all. Everything else is born of ignorance.

**Summary:** Chanting the holy name of Krishna is a merciful gift that cleanses the heart, leading to self-realization and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

Can I chant without mala and can I chant while walking with slippers? Krishna, sorry, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in his Sixth Ashtaka, he says, Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, O Krishna, you are very, very merciful. Why? Because you have given your holy name. And your holy name can be chanted by everyone in the material world today. And by chanting the holy name, we can develop love of Krishna. This is your great kripa. That when the holy name rises in our heart, what happens? The mirror of our mind gets cleansed. Our perception of the material world becomes clearer and clearer. We are able to see, I am not the body, I am a spirit soul. We are able to see that material sense creativity. We are able to see that material sense education has no value. We are able to perceive that going back to Godhead is the goal of life. So all these perceptions come about by the cleansing of the mirror of the mind. And because of this cleansing of the mind of the heart, what is it that we are achieving? Chetodarpana marjanam bhava maha dava agni nirvapanam. The intense forest fire of... Repeated material birth and death gets vanquished simply by chanting Krishna's holy name. Param vijayate sri krishna sankirtanam. So Krishna is very merciful. He has given his holy name simply by the process of chanting Hare Krishna. No big endeavor required. Simply we are to chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare, Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. Simply by doing this, the forest fire... Which is burning our heart of repeated birth and death within this material world will be vanquished and we will be able to see everything properly in full enlightenment with self-realization that I am not the body, I am spirit-soul.

So when we chant Krishna's holy name, that holy name of Krishna has as much power as if Krishna was personally standing there. This is an extremely wonderful thing. So you see the kripa of Krishna. This is the kripa of Krishna. This is the compassion of Krishna. That he has invested all his powers in his holy name. Simply by chanting Krishna's holy name, Krishna, along with all his Shakti's, potencies is present there. Nam Namakari Bahuda, Nija Sarva Shakti. Tatrarpita Niyamitah Smarane Nakalaha. Nakalaha Nanyamaha. There is no rule and regulation to be followed in chanting Krishna's holy name. Anywhere and everywhere, all the time, 24 bar 7. You can chant Krishna's holy name. And there is no consideration of place. Kala and time. No, it has to be chanted only during the three Sandhya. I cannot chant during evening. I should not chant during night time. No such restriction exists in chanting the holy name of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Although chanting Hare Krishna has no rule and regulation, what it means is, I have, there is no rule and regulation for chanting Hare Krishna, but if I want rapid progress in spiritual life by chanting Hare Krishna, I should chant a minimum fixed number of times every day without fail."
**Summary:** While there are no strict rules for chanting, a fixed number of rounds chanted daily is recommended for rapid spiritual progress.

So, to chant Krishna's holy name, to chant Hare Krishna, there are no hard and fast rules and regulations. You can wear your slipper and walk and chant Hare Krishna. You can remove your slipper and walk and chant Hare Krishna. You can wear your slipper and sit on a chair and chant Hare Krishna. You can remove your slipper and chant, sit and chant Hare Krishna. Whatever condition you want, you can sit, you can chant Hare Krishna. Whether you have a mala, you don't have a mala, you are walking, you are running, you are driving, you are swimming, you are bathing, you are eating, you are sleeping, whatever condition you want, you can sit, you can chant Hare Krishna. Whether you have a mala, you don't have a mala, you are walking, you are running, you are driving, you are swimming, you are bathing, you are eating, you are sleeping, whatever condition you want, you can sit, you can chant Hare Krishna. Whether you have a mala, you don't have a mala, you are walking, you are running, you are driving, you are swimming, you are bathing, you are eating, you are sleeping, whatever condition you are in, you can chant Hare Krishna. But the point is, this chanting of Hare Krishna has to be done according to a certain fixed number so that we can achieve quick results, rapid results in advancing in Krishna consciousness. Although chanting Hare Krishna has no rule and regulation, what it means is, I have, there is no rule and regulation for chanting Hare Krishna, but if I want rapid progress in spiritual life by chanting Hare Krishna, I should chant a minimum fixed number of times every day without fail.

**Key Quote:** "And Prabhupada said, the basic qualification, the basic number of rounds that we all have to chant is minimum 16 malas of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra every day."
**Summary:** Chanting a fixed number of rounds, specifically 16 malas, is like exercising to develop muscles, and using a mala helps keep track of the count to maintain the vow.

This is like how we exercise, suppose I want to develop my biceps, then I have to do certain exercises with dumbbells every day. I have to do it a fixed number of times every day, I have to count and do, one, two, three, four. When you go to the gym, you have seen, no, you have seen people, whatever they do, they will do according to one count and they will say, yesterday I did 30 times, now today I will do 35 times, I will do 40 times, they will count and do. So if we want rapid progress in spiritual life. And we want to take full advantage of the holy name of Krishna, then we have to chant a fixed number of times as a vow every day, minimum. And Prabhupada said, the basic qualification, the basic number of rounds that we all have to chant is minimum 16 malas of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra every day. Now, if you have to count every day that you are chanting 16 malas. 16 into 100. Each mala is 108 beads, 108 times you have to chant the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. And like that you have to do 16 times. That means 1728 times you have to chant the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra every day without fail. So to help you to keep count of how many times you are chanting, it is, the Acharyas have given us the process of chanting on the beads. So chanting on the beads is a process in our Sampradaya which is given by our Acharyas by which we can count, we can keep track of the number of times I am chanting every day so that we can maintain our vow or vrata and this will ensure that we get the richest benefit of chanting Hare Krishna. Otherwise there is no rule and regulation which needs to be followed in chanting the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the four bona fide Vaishnava Sampradayas according to the Padma Purana: Sri Sampradaya, Madhva Sampradaya (Brahma Sampradaya), Kumara Sampradaya, and Rudra Sampradaya.

According to the Padma Purana, there are four Sampradayas which are actually bona fide, referring to the four systems of philosophy: Dvaita, Vishishtha Advaita, Dvaita Advaita, and Suddha Advaita. So these four systems of philosophy are propounded by four Vaishnava Acharyas. These are the Sri Sampradaya, the Madhva Sampradaya, which is the Brahma Sampradaya, then there is the Kumara Sampradaya, and there is the Rudra Sampradaya. Vishnu Swami is the main Acharya for the Rudra Sampradaya.

**Summary:** The speaker identifies the Acharyas associated with each Sampradaya and contrasts them with Shankaracharya's Mayavada philosophy, which is not considered bona fide.

For the Kumara Sampradaya, it is Vishnu Swami, and for Sri Sampradaya, it is Ramanuja Acharya, and for Brahma Sampradaya, it is Madhva Acharya. These are the four systems of philosophy which are declined to be bona fide in the Puranas. The fifth Sampradaya, which is founded by Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya, is called Mayavada, and it is not recognized as a bona fide philosophy in the Indian system. So all these four systems of philosophy—Dvaita, Vishishta Dvaita, Shuddha Dvaita, Dvaita Dvaita—these four systems of philosophy come in the Sri Sampradaya, Kumara Sampradaya, Rudra Sampradaya, and Brahma Sampradaya.

**Key Quote:** "These four systems of philosophy, all of them are Vaishnava philosophy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the four Vaishnava Sampradayas share the common goal of achieving liberation and going to Vaikuntha, maintaining individuality as servants of the Lord, contrasting this with Adi Shankara's Kevala Dvaita, which aims at merging into impersonal Brahman.

They all accept Vishnu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all of them say that when we achieve liberation, or moksha, or mukti, we go to the spiritual world, Vaikuntha, where we will continue our individuality as an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Now, in terms of certain finer details of the philosophy, there may be some differences between these four systems, but ultimately, all of these four are aiming towards the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas Adi Shankara's philosophy of Kevala Dvaita is aiming at merging into Brahman.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Vaishnava understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth as a person (Paramatma) and the individual soul (Atma) as a fragmental portion, contrasting this with the Mayavada concept of impersonal Brahman.

There is no individual existence. The Supreme Absolute Truth is some impersonal Nirakar Brahman, whereas all the other four Vaishnava systems of philosophy, they declare that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person. It's not just some impersonal Brahman, and we are Atma. We can never become equal to Paramatma. We will always remain Paramatma as a fragmental portion of that Supreme Absolute Truth, and we will always remain as a small Jeeva, a small Atma, whereas Vishnu or Narayana, He is the Paramatma. He is the Supreme Personality. So this is the fundamental difference between the Mayavada philosophy and the combined all the four Vaishnava philosophies.

**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges minor differences within the four Vaishnava philosophies, highlighting that all accept Narayana as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, except for the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy, which considers Krishna as supreme.

Now, within the four Vaishnava philosophies, there are finer differences, very minor, they are not major, but all of them accept Narayana as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy, which is Achintya Veda Veda Tattva, which is a sub-sect of the Madhva philosophy, of the Brahma Sampradaya, we accept Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All the other four, it is Narayana. So, Krishna being the Avatari, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, on the basis of scriptural evidence, is accepted only in the Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya. All four are Vaishnava Sampradayas, but amongst the Vaishnava Sampradayas also, there are some differences.

According to the other Vaishnava Sampradayas, Krishna is supposed to be an Avatara, incarnation. But in the Madhva Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya, we understand Krishna is not an incarnation, because there are references. Krishna himself tells, declares in the Bhagavad Gita, am sarvasya prabhavo mattaha sarvam pravartate. Krishna says that He is the source of everything else. Sarvam pravartate, everything is emanating from Krishna. Everything means everything, including Narayana and Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "there is nothing above me, Krishna says."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to establish Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, citing verses from the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam that support the idea that Krishna is the source of all incarnations (Avatari).

Krishna declares openly, there is nothing above me, Krishna says. So when Krishna is saying, nothing is above Him, that means even Narayana is not above Him. Not only that, in the Bhagavatam, Bhagavatam lists 22 incarnations. Bhagavatam lists all the Purusha Avataras also. Vishnu's incarnation, three forms of Vishnu are incarnations: Karanodaka Sai Vishnu, and then Garbhodaka Sai Vishnu, Sri Rodaka Sai Vishnu, apart from that, all the other incarnations, Lord Ramachandra, Narsimha, Vamana, Kurma, Meena, all of them are listed. At the end of listing all of them, the Bhagavatam says, eteya chamsa kalahapamsa krishnastu bhagavan svayam. That all these lists of incarnations are expansions, or expansions of the expansions of Krishna, but Krishna himself is not an incarnation. He is not an avatara, He is an avatari. He is the source of all incarnations. He is the fountainhead of all incarnations. So you see, the Bhagavatam also very clearly establishes that.

**Key Quote:** "But ultimately, the four Vaishnava systems all accept that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, Paramatma, Narayana or Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the common ground among the four Vaishnava systems: the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, and the goal is to reach Vaikuntha and serve Narayana or Krishna, emphasizing that following a bona fide parampara in any of these four Sampradayas leads to this goal, unlike the Shankaracharya system.

And so, there are many other verses also in the Bhagavatam. So, like this, there may be some finer differences of opinion in the philosophies of the four systems, but ultimately, the four Vaishnava systems all accept that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, Paramatma, Narayana or Krishna, in Vaikuntha, Goloka, Vrindavan, and the goal of the human form of life is to go to the spiritual world, Vaikuntha, and remain as a person, as a personal servant to Narayana or Krishna. So, this everybody answers. That's the fundamental common ground, but in the finer details, there may be some differences, okay? So, all the four Vaishnava Sampradayas, anybody who follows the bona fide parampara in any one of these four Sampradayas—Brahma Sampradaya, Shri Sampradaya, Kumara Sampradaya, Rudra Sampradaya—they will all go to Vaikuntha or to Krishna. So, this is possible in one of these four Sampradayas, but not in the Shankaracharya system of his parampara. Alright? Thank you very much.

So the teacher knows much more than A, B, C, D, but she takes the role of somebody who is learning how to write alphabets, so that the children can learn how to write A, B, C, D.

So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, although by his personal behavior and example, he set the example of how a devotee should execute his devotion service to Krishna. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu himself did not write much literature, philosophy. He left it to his disciples, the Shad Goswamis, especially Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami. They wrote extensively about the philosophy of Bhakti Yoga. But Chaitanya Mahaprabhu himself, if you see, he left behind only the Six Ashtaka, eight verses which he composed himself.

So, this is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu wrote. This is the aspiration that every Bhakti Yogi should have: when I chant Krishna's holy name, when I chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra, tears should flow from my eyes, my voice should get choked up, my body, my hands, legs should all be trembling in great ecstasy.

If I have to wipe the floor of the temple hall, I have to sweep the temple hall, I have to render some practical devotional service like this, I will develop a taste for it. It will become greatly pleasurable for me. Nobody has to tell me as a rule, you have to follow the four regulated principles, you have to fast on ekadashi, you have to fast on janmashtami.

**Key Quote:** "So, if God is all merciful, why doesn't he protect his devotees all the time?"
**Summary:** The lecture begins by posing the question of why Krishna allows suffering, especially among devotees, despite being merciful.

This question is, why does Krishna allow us to suffer if he is always merciful? Good question. If God is all merciful, if he is all kind, why does he allow living entities to suffer in the material world? Why do we see suffering in the material world? Like we also hear, there was a pilgrimage. Some people were going in a bus to Kedarnath. Suddenly the bus fell down, had an accident and all the people died. Or there was some flood and the people who were on pilgrimage, they got killed. Or somebody was going for Navaratri and they were going on a pilgrimage somewhere and they met with an accident and they died. So, why do the devotees of God, they are religious people, they are pious people, why is God not protecting them? Such people, the religious people also suffer. They also have to undergo disease. They also have to undergo so many other distresses. They have to become old. They also have to die. So, if God is all merciful, why doesn't he protect his devotees all the time? So, the point is, Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, my devotee will never be vanquished. So, if you see in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, so many big, big generals were there. Personalities like Bhishma, Karna, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, all big, big generals, Duryodhana himself, they were all powerful fighters, warriors. Arjuna was no match for all of them. But still, at the end of the day, he was a great warrior. At the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, who survived? Pandavas survived. Entire Kaurava army was wiped out. Why? Because Krishna was protecting Arjuna. So, Krishna protects Arjuna. Why not all of us? Right? Then why do people who are going on a pilgrimage, they are going to Kedarnath, Badrinath, why are they getting killed? Why are they suffering? If you see, all the people who are going on pilgrimages, they will all have some prayer. Some problem is there. Some financial problem. Health problem is there. Health problem is there. Relational problem is there. They are going, they undertake these severe austerities. Why? Because they want their problem to be solved. And these people, they are going to God, praying to him for solving their problem. And instead, what happens? They get killed. What is this? God is not merciful.

**Key Quote:** "To the extent we surrender unto Krishna, to that extent, Krishna will protect us."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's protection is proportional to one's surrender and faith, using Arjuna's unwavering conviction as an example.

So, the point we have to understand is, when Krishna says, Krishna says, My devotee will never be vanquished. There are two aspects to this statement from Krishna. There is another statement of Krishna also in the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna says, To the extent we surrender unto Krishna, to that extent, Krishna will protect us. So, if we are partially surrendered to Krishna, something I am keeping for myself and something for Krishna also, then Krishna's protection also will be to that extent. If my faith in Krishna is not protected, then Krishna's protection also will be to that extent. If my faith in Krishna is not protected, then Krishna's protection also will be to that extent. Krishna will protect me. How much do we have faith in that understanding, in that conviction? Arjuna was fully convinced, Krishna is my sole protector. How do we know Arjuna was fully convinced of this? When Duryodhana and Arjuna went to Krishna seeking help for the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna, what did Krishna tell Arjuna? Krishna told Arjuna and Duryodhana, Krishna told Arjuna and Duryodhana, I will divide myself: one side my entire yadava army with all their modern weaponry, all their general soldiers, chariots, elephants, all of that, all the action; on the other hand, myself. I will not lift any weapon. I, all alone, unarmed, will be there on the other side. You choose which one you want. Without batting an eyelid, Arjuna said, I want you. Arjuna said, I want you. So Duryodhana was very happy. He said, ah, Arjuna is such a fool. He is taking Krishna. Okay, if Krishna and said I will fight for you, then okay, you can think because Krishna is powerful warrior. But Krishna said I will not lift any weapon, so what is the use of taking him? So I got all the army, he said, and he walked out. So when Duryodhana walked out, Krishna asked Arjuna, Arjuna, what with what intelligence, what happened to your intelligence? Why did you choose me? I said I will not fight, I will not lift a weapon, then why did you choose me? So Arjuna said, my dear Krishna, you are all alone, no need of any army soldier. One thing is required, you alone are capable of leading this battle. I know if you stand on one side, no army in the world can defeat you. Although you may be unarmed, but still at the same time, by your grace and your devotee, you will ensure that I will also be victorious. I also know that. But at the same time, I want that the credit for the victory in this battle should go to you. People should say because Krishna was there on the side of the Pandavas, the Pandavas won. So therefore I chose you. See Arjuna's conviction, even before the battle began, he knew that he was going to win because Krishna is there on his side.

#### divine protection, material limitations, Prahlad Maharaj

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Prahlad Maharaj was fully convinced Krishna is my sole protector."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Prahlad Maharaj's unwavering faith and the story of John F. Kennedy's inability to save his child to illustrate that material means are insufficient without Krishna's sanction.

So do we have that kind of conviction that hundred percent Krishna will protect me? If we have that kind of conviction, then Krishna will protect us from every danger. We look at Prahlad Maharaj. Prahlad Maharaj was fully convinced Krishna is my sole protector. In fact, the... Prahlad Maharaj has committed to Narsimha Dev, what did he say? He said, so he said, Prahlad Maharaj said, my dear Supreme Lord Narsimha, people think that if a child has got good parents, then the child has love and then man should... the right way of thinking more clearly is he had the ability of only... how many years have you been? But you could not see him. He could have not seen him. Then you can still see him, but that's why Brahmade fall thirty years of honey hidden in my eye to this sight. He to the south rationalisation of knowledge. Happy old baby man who not only might be shamed, but would say he is out... by his customs has got good parents, then the child will be well protected. But actually even the richest per... richest and most powerful parents, sometimes their children died. For example, John F Kennedy, he was the president of the United States of America, richest country, the president of the United States, most powerful man, and his wife became pregnant. And when his wife became pregnant, from the United States government, one of the topmost doctor in the country was enlisted and told that you have no other work, 24 hours here to be with John F Kennedy's wife until the child is born, here to ensure that no problem happens. So the best medical care, the best medical science, technology, money, no dirt, entire government is behind him, what more do you need? And when the child was born, it was a good thing for the child, diagnosed with a very rare physical condition. So immediately that doctor, because he was a top expert, he called other experts, they got all the most modern equipments, they put that baby into into that intensive care. After a few days, the baby died. So John F Kennedy, he did everything in his power, most powerful man, wealthiest man, why there cannot be anyone better than him in this world at that point of time? There was nobody more powerful than him, there is nobody wealthier than him, there is nobody else who had access to all the best medical science and technology, but still he could not save his child. Balasya Neha Saranam Pitarao Narsimha, just parents alone are not the cause of the protection of the children. Nartasya Chagadam, it is not that medicine alone is the cause of curing a disease.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Behind all this, unless Krishna sanctions, the parents' protection for the child will not work."
**Summary:** The speaker provides further analogies of a CEO unable to save his father despite the best medicine and the Titanic's sinking to emphasize that Krishna's sanction is ultimately necessary for protection and success.

Nartasya Chagadam, it is not that medicine alone is the cause of curing a disease. Nartasya Chagadam, it is not that medicine alone is the cause of curing a disease. I remember there was one acquaintance of mine, he was a CEO of some animation company and this was in Bangalore and what happened, he was probably 45, 50 years old and his father fell sick and he was admitted to a hospital, Malia hospital was a, you know, most advanced the hospital in Bangalore at that time. This chance speaking must be about 20-25 years back. So he write all that school w.d Kre? from Bhawana Japtanabhos科 volumes to the pages and not from your ownkie .sq. class. So Bangalore, Malia hospital was the most advanced multi-speciality hospital in Bangalore at that time. So he took his father and admitted him there and the doctors told, this condition that your father has got, if he has to survive, we have to import one medicine and every day we have to give him that injection. It will cost some, I don't remember the figure, it was some like one lakh, two lakh rupees per injection per day. So that man said, no problem, all my wealth is meant for my father, if I am not able to save my father with this money, what is the use of this money? And he was quite well off, so he could afford it, he said, go ahead, no problem. So they immediately imported the medicine and every day they started giving that injection. By the third day, the father passed away. So best medicine, no constraint of money, still the person could not be saved. Best doctors, best hospital, best medicine, imported medicine, what more can you ask for? So narthasya chagadam, for a artha, for a person who is diseased, medicine alone is not the cure. Medicine may be one of the factors, but it alone is not the factor to cure a diseased person. Udanvato majjato nauhu, Udanvati, in the ocean, majjato, somebody is drowning. Ashyam. A ship alone is not the cause of his getting saved. A ship can also become a cause of his drowning in the ocean. Titanic, they said, unsinkable ship, on its maiden voyage, it sank and more than thousand people died. Udanvato majjato nauhu, for a person who is drowning in the ocean, a boat or a ship alone is not the cause of his saving. Even the boat can capsize. Even the ship can capsize and the person will be finished. So behind all this, unless Krishna sanctions, the parents' protection for the child will not work. The medicine will not cure the disease. The boat will not be able to save the drowning man. This is the reality. So Prahlad Maharaj was fully convinced that without, ultimately without Krishna's sanction, none of these things, none of the protective measures in the material world will work.

#### surrender, devotion, divine protection

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "To the extent we are surrendered to Krishna, to that extent Krishna will protect."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts Prahlad Maharaj drinking poison unharmed due to his complete surrender and devotion, emphasizing that Krishna responds to devotion and surrender, like a father favoring an obedient child.

And if Krishna protects, then no material, uh, challenge or material problem can affect you. Prahlad Maharaj was fully convinced of this. So therefore, when his father, He told Prahlad Maharaj's mother that I've tried killing Prahlad in many ways. I tried putting him into a poison, into a pit full of poisonous snakes. I tried dipping him into a pot of boiling oil. I tried throwing him from the top of a cliff. I tried getting elephants to trample him to death. Nothing is working. So I've decided we have to give him poison. And he took a glass of poison and gave it to his wife and told, feed this to your son. So the mother started crying, how will I feed poison to my son? And Prahlad Maharaj saw his mother crying and he said, why are you crying? He said, what to do my son, your father has said, I have to feed you poison. And then Prahlad Maharaj said, okay, no problem, mother, you give me the poison. Because if you don't give me that poison, my father is such a cruel and evil man. He will make you drink that poison. So give it to me. No problem. I'll drink it. So Prahlad Maharaj confidently took that poison and he said, if Krishna wants, he will protect me. And if Krishna doesn't want, I will die. So he drank that poison. What happened? Nothing happened. Why? Because Prahlad Maharaj was firmly convinced Krishna is the sole protector. So therefore the poison, the elephants, the venomous snakes, nothing could kill him. Nothing could hurt him. So you see to the extent we are surrendered to Krishna, to that extent Krishna will protect. Krishna is not our order carrier. He is not our doorkeeper. He is not our security guard, bodyguard. That is why he is our protector. He is our protector. He is our protector. But I am a devotee, you have to protect me. No. So Krishna goes by devotion and surrender. How much we are devotional to Krishna, surrender to Krishna, how much we have confidence in Krishna, to that extent Krishna will protect us. So this is not unnatural because we have to understand that if there is a person in this material world and he has a son or a daughter who is very obedient and devoted to the father, and there is another child who is rebellious, always not listening to the father and always working contradictorily to the father's instructions, now if there is a situation where the father has to save one of the child, one of the children, whom will he choose? Naturally first he will try to save the child who is obedient, no? Natural. Similarly Krishna also. He will first protect. He will first protect. He will give his full protection to one who is fully surrendered to him.

#### eternal soul, liberation, Krishna's mercy

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Ultimately Krishna's protection is for the soul, not for the body."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that while devotees still face physical challenges, Krishna's ultimate protection is the liberation of the soul from repeated birth and death, offering a return to Godhead.

This is one thing. Another thing we have to understand is no matter even if we become a pure devotee, fully surrendered to Krishna, still one day or the other we have to die. Still old age will come, still disease will come because this is the material body. Material body will become diseased, it will become old, it will become destroyed at one point of time. But we, spirit soul, are eternal. We are eternal. We are not going to get destroyed. Body may get destroyed, but we will not get destroyed. Avinashituti tadviddhi, yena sarvam etan tatam. This body is pervaded by the soul. It's pervaded by our consciousness. So even though the body may get destroyed, we will not get destroyed. So ultimately Krishna's protection is for the soul, not for the body. For the body also, Krishna will give protection if it is essential. Like Krishna protected Arjuna and Prahlad Mahabharata. Like Krishna protected Arjuna and Prahlad Mahabharata. But then Over and above that is Krishna's protection from repeated birth and death within the material world. Once a devotee dies, Krishna will take the devotee back to godhood, where there is no more birth and death. Yad gatvana nim ratan te taddioSo Krishna said Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, if you become a pure devotee, Krishna says I will take you to my abode the spiritual world where you don't old, there is no disease there, there is no financial problem, there is no, there is no problem at all that you will have to face. You have only to simply sing and dance and enjoy in total bliss there. So Krishna is ready to take us there. So that is the real protection of Krishna ultimately. So externally, it might seem that even a devotee is becoming old, devotees become diseased, even he is dying. But then what happens after that death? The devotee goes back to Godhead. Non-devotee what happens? He is again put into another body, again he has to undergo the cycle of repeated birth, death, disease, old age. Repeatedly he has to undergo. So Krishna's, ultimately Krishna's protection isn't taking us back to Godhead. So Krishna is all merciful. He gives his protection to his devotees. Now the question is, if Krishna is all merciful, why is he protecting only his devotees? Why

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says, I am equal to everyone. I am impartial."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the apparent contradiction of Krishna being impartial yet favoring devotees, explaining that Krishna's impartiality lies in granting free will while constantly striving to bring souls back to Him through scriptures, devotees, and incarnations.

is he partial? But Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, nadeśvostin apriyaḥ samoham sarva-bhūteśv. Krishna says, I am equal to everyone. I am impartial. But at the same time, Krishna is giving special protection to his devotees. How do we understand this? So to understand this is very simple. Krishna is very merciful. We have rebelled against Krishna from the spiritual world and come to the material world. Krishna could have abandoned us, get lost. I am not bothered about it. I am not bothered about it. I am not bothered about it. I am not bothered about it. I am not bothered about you, Krishna could have abandoned us. No. But Krishna did not abandon we have forgotten Krishna. We have rejected Krishna and Come here, but Krishna no, he has rejected me. but Krishan no. He has rejected me. He has forgotten me, but no, he's my Amchā. He's my child. I cannot forget him. So what Krishna does Krishna sends his pure devotees, āchāryas do the material world. Personalities like Ramana Jāchārya, Madhvāchārya, Selep Praupadhi himself. All these personalities come from the spiritual world, his teachings when he moved them from his... He moved them from his spiritual world. And then Krishan Dash engineering by these spiritual the spiritual world. Krishna has sent them here to tell us about Krishna and take us back to Godhead. As if that is not enough, Krishna gives the Vedic scriptures. He gives the Upanishads, the Vedanta Sutras, where he talks that you are not the body, you are spirit soul, your destination is, your eternal about is the spiritual world, come back there. So Krishna gives the Vedic scriptures for this. And even after that Krishna is not satisfied Krishna incarnates in many many different ages. He incarnates as Ramachandra, he incarnates as Narasimha, he incarnates as Vamana. In every incarnation what is he doing? He is telling forget this material world and come back to the spiritual world. So Krishna gives the Vedic scriptures, Krishna sends his pure devotees as Acharyas, Krishna incarnates. Even after doing all this Krishna is not satisfied. Krishna personally comes himself. And he incarnates. He demonstrates what are all the activities he does in the spiritual world. How he plays with Yesodamayi, Nandamaharaj, with the cows, with the Gopas, with the Gopis. Why Krishna does, has to do all these things in the material world? These are all his activities in the spiritual world. Why is he doing that in the material world? Because he wants us to see. See this is how the spiritual world is. You all can come back with me to the spiritual world and you can also enjoy with me like this. So Krishna comes personally. And how do we understand, so Krishna's impartiality is in allowing us freedom to surrender unto him or not surrender unto him. Krishna spoke the Bhagavad Gita and then Krishna told Arjuna yathaye chasi tathakuru. Oh Arjuna, I have told you whatever I have told you to do, whatever I have to tell I have told you, now you decide what you want to do. You want to surrender unto me, become my devotee and serve me or you don't want to surrender. I'm not going to surrender to my instructions. And if you decide to surrender unto me, Then I'm there for you. I will be protecting you and I will take you back to God. So even if one is an atheist, even if one is a non believer, if he surrenders to Krishna,

**Key Quote:** "Any living entity comes to me and surrenders unto me saying, Tavasmi, O Ramachandra, I am yours. Please accept me. Abhayam Sarvada Dasyami. I will eternally protect him."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Vibhishana surrendering to Ramachandra to illustrate Krishna's promise to protect anyone who surrenders, regardless of their past, while those who don't surrender are governed by the law of karma.

Krishna will forget everything else and take him back to God. In fact, in the Ramayana, in the when Lord Ramachandra had taken the Vanara army. Ramachandra took the Lord Ramachandra and even as... Lord Ramachandra had taken the Lord Ramachandra. So even then he was in that state. He is leaving army to Lanka and they were making plans to attack Lanka to free Sita from the clutches of Ramana. What happened? Vibhishana came there. Vibhishana rejected his brother Ramana and he came to Ramachandra wanting to, because Vibhishana was also a devotee of Ramachandra so he wanted to join the army of Lord Ramachandra. He wanted to serve Lord Ramachandra. So when Vibhishana came, Ramachandra called all the Vanaras, Sugriva, Hanuman, all these people, Jambavan and he asked them, what should we do? He has come here. He has said he wants to surrender unto me and he wants to take my shelter and he wants to be with us. So Sugriva and others said, Ramachandra, we have to be very careful. Although he has come saying that he is wanting to surrender to you, but he is after all from an Asura, he is born in an Asura Kula. He is a brother of Ramana. And these Asuras cannot be trusted. Who knows he may have come here to spy upon us and then relay all that information to Ramana to defeat us. So we think you should not entertain him. So then Lord Ramachandra responded. Lord Ramachandra said, any person, any living entity who comes to me and surrenders to me. Even if I surrender to you, I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. Any living entity comes to me and surrenders unto me saying, Tavasmi, O Ramachandra, I am yours. Please accept me. Abhayam Sarvada Dasyami. I will eternally protect him. Why Vibhishana? If Ravana comes here and surrenders to me and says that Ramachandra, I am surrendering unto you, I will protect him also. This was Lord Ramachandra's statement. So you see, Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so impartial. We may be atheistic, we may be inimical to Krishna, but the moment we surrender to Krishna and say, Krishna, I am yours, finished. Krishna will take full responsibility and full charge of him. And Krishna will take him back to Godhead. So this is the impartiality of Krishna. Krishna has given the knowledge, instructions in the Bhagavad Gita, but anybody who picks it up and surrenders to Krishna, Krishna will immediately take charge of him. So this is the mercy of Krishna. Therefore Krishna is all merciful. Krishna has given us free will and allowed us. You don't want to surrender unto me? No problem. Then the law of karma will act according to the activities if you do. If you do pious activities, you will get enjoyment. If you do sinful activities, you will have to suffer. This is the law of karma in essence, in a very simplistic way. This is the law of karma in essence, in a very simplistic way.

**Key Quote:** "The moment we fully surrender to Krishna, no matter how much sinful activities we have accumulated in our past lives, Krishna says, all of that finished."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that suffering arises from the law of karma for those not fully surrendered, but complete surrender to Krishna nullifies past sins and guarantees protection and liberation, emphasizing Krishna's mercy and impartiality.

So Krishna has said, either you don't surrender to me, then you are governed by the law of karma. So according to the law of karma, if you have done some impious activity, some sinful activity in the past life, you will suffer. Krishna says, I will not interfere. So therefore there is suffering in the material world. Somebody may have partially surrendered to Krishna. He may be a devotee of Krishna, but still he has done some sinful activity. He may be a devotee of Krishna, but still he has done some sinful activity. That means he has not fully surrendered to Krishna. So he has done sinful activity, he has to suffer for that. Loss of this one material nature cannot be... Nobody can violate the laws of karma, the laws of material nature. But if he fully surrendered to Krishna, eshāntu antagatam pāpam janānām puṇya-karmanām te dvandva-moha-nirmukta bhajante mām dhratavratā bhajante mām Those who render devotional service to Krishna, antagatam pāpam, giving up all sinful activities, no more sinful activity, and always engaged in pious activity and rendering only devotional service to Krishna, such people, Krishna will protect from all miseries and Krishna will take back to God. But if we engage in sinful activity, that means we are not fully surrendered to Krishna, then Krishna's protection is also limited. He will allow the law of karma to act. And if I have done a sinful activity, I have to suffer, I have to suffer. Krishna will not interfere. But the moment we surrender unto Krishna, what happens? sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ rajaḥ āṁ tvām sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣiṣyām The moment we fully surrender to Krishna, no matter how much sinful activities we have accumulated in our past lives, Krishna says, all of that finished. I will remove everything. I will burn off everything. This is the mercy of Krishna. This is the impartiality of Krishna. You understand? So, just because somebody is suffering, we cannot say that God is not merciful. God is very merciful. He is allowing us to walk on the path which we want. Either surrender to Him or not surrender unto Him.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the question of why lust persists even after spiritual progress, explaining that Krishna describes lust (kama) as an eternal enemy to spiritual practitioners.

Now this question, I have understood the teaching and importance of Krishna Consciousness so that I was able to overcome many of my attachments voluntarily. But lust is not like that. Why am I still finding taste in that, in lust? So Krishna tells about lust, that kama or lust is very deep rooted, kama yesha krodha yesha, rajo guna samudbha vaha. So kama, Krishna describes kama or lust as nitya vairinaha. It is an eternal existence. It is the eternal enemy of a transcendentalist, of a person who wants to practice spiritual life.

**Key Quote:** "As long as we do not give up the mode of passion, as long as we do not situate ourselves in sattoguna, the mode of goodness, what will happen, we will not be able to become free from the influence of lust and anger."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the interconnectedness of lust, anger, greed, illusion, envy, and madness, explaining that they arise from the mode of passion (rajoguna) and can only be overcome by cultivating the mode of goodness (sattoguna).

So this lust and anger, kama and krodha, we have to understand that these six things, kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha, matsarya, lust, anger, greed, illusion and then kama, krodha, lobha, mada, madness. Matsarya, envy, these six things always go hand in hand. They are like six brothers. If one is there, all the other five will also be there. So they may not manifest, all of the six may not manifest at the same time. But if one of them is present, that means the other five brothers are also residing within our heart. So Krishna says that these kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha, matsarya, these six enemies arise out of our contact with rajoguna, the mode of passion. As long as we do not give up the mode of passion, as long as we do not situate ourselves in sattoguna, the mode of goodness, what will happen, we will not be able to become free from the influence of lust and anger.

**Key Quote:** "If I pursue material knowledge, I want to do engineering, I want to do medical... All that material education we acquire in the schools and colleges are actually increasing the rajoguna component of rajoguna in our life."
**Summary:** The speaker asserts that freedom from lust requires ceasing association with the mode of passion, which is prominent in the material world and increased by the pursuit of material knowledge.

So if we really want to become free from lust. We have to stop associating with the mode of passion, rajoguna. The mode of passion, the mode of rajoguna is most prominent within this material world. It is prominent in people's desire to enjoy, to become happy. It manifests in different forms. Economic prosperity, peace. Everybody, all of us should live in harmony. Everybody should cooperate. Morality. We should help others. We should have that nationalistic spirit. We should, you know, strive for the country. All these are different forms of manifestation of rajoguna, the mode of passion. The progress. Rajoguna. Progress or the pursuit of material knowledge is also a product of the mode of passion. If I pursue material knowledge, I want to do engineering, I want to do medical, this one, I want to become a doctor, want to become a lawyer. We have different kinds of aspirations in this material world. And so that's how we go to college, we go to school. All that material education we acquire in the schools and colleges are actually increasing the rajoguna component in our life. They are increasing the mode of passion. Then how can you become free from lust?

**Summary:** The speaker explains that both formal material education and the knowledge acquired from society contribute to increasing the mode of passion, thus intensifying lust.

Not possible. See, when we are born as children, there is no force of lust in our heart. As we grow, slowly, gradually, we get more and more educated in material life. We acquire more and more material education. May not. Even if it is not for us. Maybe it is not formal education. I may be an illiterate. I may not have gone to school or college. But still I learn from people around me. I learn from material world, oh this is what I should aspire for. I should aspire to earn money. I should aspire to have a good house. I should have a good girlfriend or a good boyfriend. I should have children. I should have a family. I have a country. I should be proud of my country. All these things we pick up and learn. These are also knowledge that we acquire from around the material world around us. So, pursuit of material education in schools and colleges, as well as what we learn from the society around us, both of them are actually teaching us to increase the amount of Rajoguna in our lives. Then how can you become free from this one, lust? That is why you will see. As we grow older. And as we acquire more and more knowledge about the world around us, what happens? Lust also increases.

**Key Quote:** "In the Vedic times, the emphasis was not on material education. The emphasis was on spiritual education... so when that spiritual knowledge was most prominent in people's lives the influence of lust was also less"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts modern society's material advancement with the Vedic emphasis on spiritual education, arguing that the former leads to increased lust while the latter fostered restraint.

You see, India 50 years ago was not very materially advanced, economically not very advanced, technologically knowledge wise also not very advanced. So you look at India 50 years back, the level, the amount of lust in people's heart was not so high. People were far more restrained. But today, you look at the people, they become like animals. Men cannot control themselves. They will go and molest women, rape women, forget about women, even children are not spared. You look at movies, you look at novels, you look at television, serials, everywhere you see, that display of lust is going on increasing. As we are materially advancing, as we are improving in our knowledge acquisition systems and material knowledge, simultaneously the influence of lust is also increasing in the society. In the Vedic times, the emphasis was not on material education. The emphasis was on spiritual education. From the age of five years, till 25 years. Every person had to respond. It was a beautiful world. go and live in the gurukula where he will be taught you are not the body your spirit soul the goal of life is to go back to godhead along with that also material education would also be given whatever is needed for that person to execute his livelihood that much knowledge would be given not that everybody has to learn everything no if you are a kshatriya you learn administrative knowledge if you are a vaisya learn how to do business if you are a brahmana you learn only spiritual knowledge that used to be the system you have limited material knowledge but primarily in those 20 years you live in the gurus ashram what happens you learn about spiritual knowledge so when that spiritual knowledge was most prominent in people's lives the influence of lust was also less

**Summary:** The speaker argues that despite perceived advancements in civility and equality, material progress correlates with a decline in control over lust and an increase in its manifestation.

now when people are materially advancing we are supposed to be a civilized society our understanding of how civility comes about women have to be given equal rights in society we should not discriminate on the basis of caste creed color religion race nationality etc all these concepts we feel we have understood these things better we are more advanced but simultaneously what is happening girl children are giving birth to babies in nine standard 10 standard in the toilets of the schools this is what is becoming common nowadays yes or no this is the reality the president of france says that in schools we should distribute contraceptives freely to the students why because if you don't do that they are anyway engaging in sex and we are having to face teen pregnancies so this is a problem in the west also not only in india india is coming today west has been grappling with this problem since ages so you see the more materially advanced you are the lesser the control on lust the greater the display of lust so if we associate with the mode of passion the greater the display of lust so if we associate with the mode of passion

**Key Quote:** "If you want to become free from lust you have to increase the component of and if you have to increase whatever is aspired for in the modern day society you have to give up...In Kali Yuga, the method is to directly associate with Krishna himself."
**Summary:** The speaker states that overcoming lust requires increasing sattva guna, which in Kali Yuga is best achieved by directly associating with Krishna through devotional practices.

lust will increase if you want to become free from lust you have to increase the component of and if you have to increase whatever is aspired for in the modern day society you have to give up that's the reality so as long as you live in that material life and you go on you know associating with people even if you associate with people who have this kind of aspirations To earn money, to have a good material life, to be peaceful, comfortable, to have a status and prestige in society, to have a good partner in life. Anybody who has desires like this, you associate with them, the influence of Rajoguna will contaminate you and your heart will be conquered by lust. So if you want to become free from lust, only way is that you have to give up your association with Rajoguna and you have to associate with Sattva Guna. And in Kali Yuga, Sattva Guna is very rarely obtained. So in Kali Yuga, the method is to directly associate with Krishna himself. Because Krishna is Pavitram Paramam Bhavan, Krishna is the purest personality. So if we associate with Krishna, we are associating with Vishuddha Sattva, not even Sattva Guna. And if we associate with Krishna by chanting Krishna's holy name, by following the regulative principles, by getting up early in the morning and chanting during Brahmamurtha, by rendering practical devotional service for the spiritual master's mission, by all these things what happens? We increase the quantity of Vishuddha Sattva, our contact with Vishuddha Sattva we establish. Okay? And by that what happens? The influence of Rajoguna will come down.

So therefore, unless we increase the component of Bhakti in our life, unless we ensure that we remain connected with Krishna... we cannot help but be conquered by the forces of lust and anger."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the difficulty of conquering lust, even for great sages, and stresses the need for constant connection with Krishna through bhakti to avoid being overcome by lust and anger, using the story of Vishwamitra Muni as an example.

So conquering lust is not very easy, it is very tough. Even great sages like Vishwamitra Muni, even he, such a great sage, even he fell victim to lust. So therefore, unless we increase the component of Bhakti in our life, unless we ensure that we remain connected with Krishna. Connected with Krishna at every second in our life, unless we do that, we cannot help but be conquered by the forces of lust and anger. So we have to understand this, every second, every moment in my life, in my day has to be filled with Krishna, with devotional service to Krishna. Even if one second you give, lust will enter. You see Vishwamitra Muni was deep in meditation. He had shut out the whole world. I don't want any connection with the material world. Closed his eyes, cut off all his senses from the outside world, pratyahara, samadhi, deep within. And just for a moment, he heard the tinkling of the ankle bells of the Aksaras. Immediately his meditation broke and finished. Forgot all his spiritual life. So you see, even one moment of inattention can wreak havoc in our spiritual life.

**Summary:** The speaker advises filling every moment with remembrance of Krishna, particularly through chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, to prevent the entry of maya and lust.

So the lesson that we have to learn is, we have to fill our life constantly from every moment, eating, sleeping, waking, every moment, whatever we are doing, we have to keep remembering Krishna. And remembering Krishna in today's world is very easy. It is very easy. How do we do that? Chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Constantly throughout the day we keep chanting Krishna's holy name. Then what will happen? We will remain connected with Krishna and there will be no scope for maya to enter, for lust to enter.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of Krishna as the sun and maya as darkness to illustrate that the presence of Krishna dispels maya, and emphasizes that ISKCON was created to train individuals to constantly remember Krishna.

Krishna sudhya sama, maya hoy andhakaar. Krishna is like the brilliant sun. Effulgent sun. You know how when the sun, one sun rises in the morning in the east, what happens? All the darkness of the night is dispelled. Now it is night time, right? We need so many lights to dispel the darkness in this room alone. Outside, if you look outside the window, it is dark outside. You see how it is? So many lights can dispel the darkness only in this one room. Now the whole universe, whole earth, can dispel the darkness. So many lights can dispel the darkness only in this one room. The one sun, one bulb of the sun rises in the morning, entire earth, the darkness vanishes. Whatever horizon we are, the eastern horizon. So you see that one star, one bulb of the sun is enough to drive away all the darkness. You don't need multiple suns. In the morning time, once the sun has risen, you don't need a torch. You don't need to switch on the light. Let me dispel all the darkness in this room. Because there is only one sun. Moment the sun rises, you switch off all the light. No more electricity needed. So Krishna Surya Sama, Krishna is like Surya. One Krishna is enough, brilliant like the sun. Maya Hoi Andhaka and Maya, material energy, is like the darkness of the night. Yaha Krishna Taha Nahi Maya Adhikaar. Wherever Krishna is, there is no Maya Adhikaar. Where Krishna is present, there the darkness of Maya cannot enter. So if you want to become free from lust, the only way is, we have to practice how every second of my life, I will remember Krishna and nothing else. And Prabhupada created this movement, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, this Hare Krishna movement, for exactly that purpose. To give us this opportunity. To learn, to get trained, how to remain always in remembrance of Krishna and to never forget him.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes that overcoming lust requires developing devotional service to Krishna through sustained practice, training, and sincere effort, emphasizing that there are no shortcuts.

This is the whole idea. So in a simple way, if you have to get free from lust, only way is to develop devotional service to Krishna. And that also won't happen overnight. It takes several years of practice and it requires lot of training. And constant loving association with a pure devotee like Srila Prabhupada to overcome lust. But it is possible. Many great personalities in the past have become free from lust. If you look at Prabhupada, Prabhupada is a brilliant example of a person who is completely free from lust. So these example of such great personalities like Haridas Thakur, Srila Prabhupada, Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, Narada Muni, all these personalities, these examples are there in our scriptures as well as in our lives. We get to see such personalities so that we know it is possible to become free from lust. But I should be ready to take that austerity, that tapasya and undergo the whole training process. There is no shortcut. It requires lot of hard work and there is no magic. You come to me, you give me some money and I will give you some basma and overnight you will become free from lust. Nothing like that is going to happen. You have to do lot of hard work. You have to show your sincerity to Krishna

**Key Quote:** "If you were this much attached to Krishna, how much good you might achieve."
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa narrates the story of Bilvamangal Thakur, a pure devotee who fell from a high spiritual platform due to attachment, and how his spiritual master, through the words of a prostitute, Chintamani, reignited his devotion.

Hare Krishna! Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki Jai! Often, Srila Prabhupada narrated the real-life story of Srila Bilvamangal Thakur. Bilvamangal Thakur was a great pure devotee of Krishna, who is said to have lived around the 8th century, although the exact timelines of his birth are not known. He was a pure devotee who came in the line of Srila Vishnuswami, who is an Acharya of the Rudra Sampradaya. Bilvamangal Thakur is said to have lived for almost 700 years, and he composed many wonderful bhajans on Krishna. His most famous work, of course, is the Krishna Karnamrita, which Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu treasured. Bilvamangal Thakur was born into a wealthy Brahmana family, but instead of developing saintly character as a qualified Brahmana, he became attached to a prostitute, Chintamani. He was so attached to the prostitute that he couldn't stay even one day without meeting her. One day, it so happened that Bilvamangal Thakur's father passed away. He was forced to stay back for the funeral rites for his father, but he was still restless to meet Chintamani. You can imagine, Bilvamangal Thakur's father has passed away, and he is still itching to meet Chintamani. That shows how attached he was to the Brahmana family. As soon as the rituals were completed, Bilvamangal Thakur rushed to meet Chintamani the same day because it had already gotten late. By that time, it was already evening and it had started raining heavily. Despite the downpour, Bilvamangal Thakur hurried to meet Chintamani. On the way, he had to cross a river, and when he reached the river, he found that the river was swollen due to the heavy rain, and there was no boat either to take him across the river. Finding no other alternative, what did he do? He jumped into the river, but the current was so fierce, it started sweeping him away. Clutching desperately here and there, he fortunately found something floating in the furious spate of the river waters. Taking it to be a log of wood, he clung on to it for dear life and somehow managed to reach the other bank. With great relief, Billumangal Thakur got out of the water and on some instinct, he turned back and when he turned back, he was horrified to see that what he thought was a log of wood he had been clinging on to was actually a corpse, a dead body. Anyway, he shrugged it off and continued on to Chintamani's house. By now, it was pretty dark and when he reached Chintamani's house, he found that the gate was locked. Since it had become dark and it was raining torrentially, Chintamani thought that Billumangal Thakur would not come today and so, she had locked the main gate and it was pouring because of the sound, the thunder, the lightning, the rain, not being able to attract the attention of anyone inside the house. What happened? Billumangal Thakur became desperate. He tried knocking the gate, he tried doing this, that, but he couldn't capture the attention of anyone within the house. Then, when he was looking around, he luckily found a rope hanging down from the compound wall. So, he was able to get out of the house and he was able to immediately latched on to it, climbed up the wall and jumped over. And after jumping over, when he looked back, he realized that it was not a rope, it was a snake. He had narrowly missed being bitten by the snake to death. Heaving a sigh of relief, he walked up to the house and knocked on the door. Finally, he had reached his destination. What an adventure it had been. Chintamani opened the door, wondering who would have come to her house in the downpour. She was stunned to see Billumangal Thakur standing there. He then narrated to her how he had risked his life not once but twice despite his father's having passed away to come to her doorstep. When Chintamani heard this, she said, if only you had this much attachment to Krishna, your life would have been so glorious. Something like that. Suddenly, somewhere a switch got flipped inside. Billumangal Thakur, without wasting another moment, he turned and left her, never to return. He went on to Sri Vrindavan Dham and the rest, as they say, is history. Srila Prabhupada explains this incident in the book, Path of Perfection, in chapter 8. There, Srila Prabhupada says, in this regard, there is the example of Billumangal Thakur, who in his previous life was elevated almost to premabhakti, the highest platform of devotional service. However, since there is always a chance for a fall down, somehow or other he fell down. In his next life, he was born in a very rich brahmana family in accordance with the principle enunciated in the sixth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 41. Unfortunately, as is often the case with rich boys, he became a prostitute hunter. Yet, it is said that his spiritual master instructed him through his prostitute, saying, oh, you are so attached to this mere flesh and bones. If you were this much attached to Krishna, how much good you might achieve. Immediately, Billumangal Thakur resumed his devotional service. So, you see, what is Srila Prabhupada saying? The words of the prostitute, Chintamani, had such a profound life-transforming effect on Billumangal Thakur. Why? Because it was actually, Billumangal Thakur's Diksha Guru speaking through her. Srila Prabhupada explained this principle in greater detail in this lecture on the Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verses 35 through 45, recorded on February 20, 1969 in Los Angeles. Listen to what Srila Prabhupada explained.

**Key Quote:** "Finish your business in this life."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the spiritual master will always come back until his disciples achieve God-realization, but disciples should be serious in their practice and not take advantage of the spiritual master's mercy.

I have heard it said that the spiritual master will always come back until his devotee, his disciples, has achieved God-realization. Can you explain that? Yes, but don't try to take advantage of it. Don't try to give trouble to your spiritual master. Finish your business in this life. That is especially meant for those who are slack. A devotee or a disciple should be serious in serving spiritual master. If he is intelligent, he should know that why should I act in such a way that my spiritual master has to take the trouble to reclaim me again? Let my business be finished in this life. That should be the right way of thinking. Not that, I am sure my spiritual master will come. Let me do... That's it. No. So if you have got any, I mean to say, affection for the spiritual master, then you should finish your business in this life so that he may not come again to see you. Is that all right? Don't take advantage of this leave-in. Rather be serious to finish your business. That is a fact.

**Key Quote:** "Immediately he took you back to Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada reiterates the story of Bilvamangal Thakur, emphasizing the spiritual master's responsibility to reclaim fallen disciples, but also stressing that disciples should not take advantage of this.

There is an instance of Bhīlāmamara Ṭhākura. Bhīlāmamara Ṭhākura was in his previous life elevated to almost prema-bhakti, highest platform of devotional service. But there is always a chance of fall down. So somewhere or other he fell down. And next life he was born in a very rich family. I will tell you. As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, śucināṁ śrīmatāṁ kīḥ. So he was born in a rich brāhmaṇa family, but he became naturally as rich boys, become attached to woman-hunter. So it is said that his spiritual master instructed him through his prostitute. At the right moment, his spiritual master said through that prostitute, you are so much attached with this flesh and bone. If you had been attached so much with Kṛṣṇa, how would you have achieved it? Immediately he took you back to Kṛṣṇa. So that responsibility is for the spiritual master. But we should not take advantage of that. That is not very good. We should try yasya-prasāda bhagavata-prasāda. We should not try and put our spiritual master in the position that he has reclaimed me from prostitutes house. But he has to do that because he accept the childhood. He has got the responsibility.

**Key Quote:** "It is the duty of the Diksha Guru to take the disciple to Krishna."
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa explains that the Diksha Guru has the duty to take the disciple to Krishna, even if it means returning to the material world after disappearing from it.

So, in this lecture, you have heard Śrīla Prabhupāda explain that sofa-mangal Thakur was elevated to the stage of bhāva bhakti in his previous life. But because he could not complete the process and reach the stage of Krishna Prema, he had to take one more birth. And he took his birth in a pious, wealthy Brahmana family, so that there would be no obstacles to his resuming his devotional service. But unfortunately, he deviated. Then his Diksha Guru had to act through Chintamani to reignite the fire of devotional service in his life. An ordinary person's words cannot bring about such a vast transformation in a person's life like Chintamani's words did in Billumangal Thakur's life. Hence, it is clear that it was not Chintamani. It was Billumangal Thakur's Diksha Guru who spoke to him through Chintamani. And therefore, there was a sudden 180-degree transformation in his life, as if a light switch had suddenly started. He had been flipped, flooding a dark room with light within a split second. Srila Prabhupada reiterated this in another lecture given on the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 6, Chapter 3, verse number 18, recorded on 11th February 1971 in Gorakhpur. See, my Guru Maharaj used to say like that, that finish this business in this life. Don't delay for the next life. He was telling also, that don't give me trouble again to come here to Delhi Gali. That is the response of the spiritual master. Spiritual master's response to this is to take the disciple to Krishna until he is able to help him. That is the bodhisattva, just like Billumangal Thakur. The spiritual master delivered him, taking the shape of a process. So here, you heard Srila Prabhupada say that it is the verdict of the Shastras, and also that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswathi Thakur said, that it is the duty of the Diksha Guru to take the disciple to Krishna. And, if the disciple does not perfect his life, then the Diksha Guru has to again come to take the disciple to Krishna. Codex Prorogative – försörtằng Profetikur the disciple to Krishna. Come means come from where? Where does the spiritual master come from? It means that if the spiritual master has disappeared and the disciple doesn't perfect himself but the disciple has to take one more birth, then the spiritual master, the Diksha Guru who has gone to the spiritual world has to come back to take the disciple back to the spiritual

**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa quotes Srila Prabhupada saying he is ready to come back from Goloka Vrindavan to deliver his disciples, emphasizing the importance of staying connected to the disciplic succession.

world. In this letter to Brahmananda, dated 15 November 1969, Srila Prabhupada said this, regarding your request for your deliverance from the clutches of Maya, please rest assured of being delivered because we have captured the strong chain of disciplic succession. This chain is coming down from the highest platform Krishna, just like a rope comes down the well so that anyone who may catch the rope from any position is sure to be delivered. So our aim should be to not give up the rope. We must capture the rope very tightly. Then our deliverance is assured. So far as I am concerned, in relationship with my disciples who are so kindly cooperating with me in the matter of my rendering service to my spiritual master, for them I am always ready to come back from Goloka Vrindavan. Come back from where? Come back from Goloka Vrindavan if they are not delivered along with me. So don't be worried about the clutches of Maya. Here Srila Prabhupada says that if his disciples are not delivered, Prabhupada will personally come back from Goloka Vrindavan to take them back there. As the Diksha Guru, Srila Prabhupada has revealed that after his disappearance, he will be in Goloka Vrindavan. And although he is so far away, Goloka Vrindavan is so far away, he still keeps the closest connection to the Lord. keeps meticulous track of his disciples from Goloka. And if he sees that any of his disciples are not able to progress, then he is ready to again come down from Goloka to take us back. Just like Billumangal Thakur's Diksha Guru saw that he had deviated from devotional service in his next life and the Diksha Guru spoke through the prostitute to bring him back to the right path. Similarly, Srila Prabhupada is also ready to continue to guide and instruct his disciples personally till they also return to Goloka where Srila Prabhupada is. And Srila Prabhupada

**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa continues to emphasize Srila Prabhupada's promise to take his disciples back to Goloka, even if it requires him to return, and reiterates the story of Bilvamangal Thakur to illustrate the Diksha Guru's role.

reiterated the same fact in another letter to Tushna Krishna written on 14th of December 1972. There Srila Prabhupada wrote, why you only want to be in the spiritual sky with Siddha Swarupa? If Siddha Swarupa can go, why not everyone? Siddha Swarupa will go, you will go, Shyamasundara will go, all others will go. We will have another ISKCON there. Of course, Mr. Nair must stay. And if somebody does not go, then I shall have to come back to take him there. One should remember this and every one of my disciples should act in such a way that they may go with me and may not have to come back to take another birth. Again, here Srila Prabhupada confirmed the fact that Srila Prabhupada will come down from Goloka to take his disciples back to Goloka. So, as Srila Prabhupada mentioned, as per Shastra and as per Sadhu, the Sadhu meaning Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, it is a principle that the Diksha Guru who is a resident of the spiritual world must take the responsibility of taking the disciple back to Krishna, even if it means that the Diksha Guru has to come back to the material world to do so. This means that after the spiritual world, the Diksha Guru has to come back to the material world to do so. After the spiritual master disappears, it is not that he is no longer performing the function of the Diksha Guru. It is not that the Diksha Guru becomes no longer living. The Diksha Guru continues to perform the role of the Diksha Guru just like when he was in flesh and blood. In the vivid example of Biloba Mangal Thakur, his Diksha Guru saw that Biloba Mangal Thakur needed one specific intervention to bring him back to the path of Bhakti. So, the Diksha Guru implemented the Diksha Guru. The Diksha Guru implemented the intervention by speaking specific words through the prostitute so that Biloba Mangal Thakur would rekindle his forgotten devotion to Krishna. This was a very specific input required and which was given by his Diksha Guru. The Diksha Guru was his guru right from his previous life and the Diksha Guru was not present as a living guru physically before Biloba Mangal Thakur. Yet, that Diksha Guru acted.

**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa explains the function of the Diksha Guru, even after physical disappearance, to administer specific realizations to the disciple, ultimately leading to Swaroopa Siddhi and return to Goloka.

In the most suitable way for his spiritual benefit. This then is the function of the Diksha Guru. The Diksha Guru may not be physically present. He may no longer be a quote-unquote living guru. He might have gone back to the spiritual world like Srila Prabhupada says about himself. But still, the Diksha Guru's responsibility doesn't end. He has to keep administering specific realizations to the disciple so that the Diksha Guru keeps inspiring the disciple till he reaches Goloka. If necessary, the Diksha Guru may even have to again descend to the material world to take the disciple back. It is not that the Diksha Guru has chanted on the beads and chosen a name, presided over a yajna and that's it. It doesn't end there. The relationship is eternal. In fact, Srila Prabhupada says that, we will have one more ISKCON in Goloka. Meaning that even after we return to Goloka, Srila Prabhupada will continue to inspire the disciples, instruct us, train us, guide us in our service to Radha and Krishna in Goloka. That means the Diksha Guru gives Divedjana or transcendental realization within the heart of the disciple eternally in this material world also, in the spiritual world also. And this transcendental realization that the spiritual master Diksha Guru reveals within the heart begins with I am not the body up till the point of realizing my Swaroopa. If I have not realized my Swaroopa how can I go to Goloka? Unless you have attained Swaroopa Siddhi, how can you go back to Goloka? That means the Diksha Guru takes the responsibility of giving specific realizations to the disciple right from you are not the body till revealing who you are in the spiritual world. And unless the Diksha Guru himself is a Swaroopa Siddha, how can he give Swaroopa Siddhi to his disciple? So when Srila Prabhupada says that he will come back from Goloka, he will come back from Goloka. It means he is staying in Goloka in his Swaroopa. And when he says he will take us, his disciples back to Goloka, that means he will give us Swaroopa Siddhi. He will reveal to us who we are in the spiritual world at the right time. Srila Prabhupada has unequivocally and boldly, confidently stated this. Actually this is the main and most important function of the Diksha Guru which is to administer Divyajjana, divine divine awareness and one's true self-realization. That is the main function. So, what is the main and most important function of the Diksha Guru which is to administer Divyajjana

#### Diksha Guru, Divya Jnana, Srila Prabhupada, Ritvik system, ISKCON

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada administers that for each of his disciples directly in their heart."
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa contrasts Srila Prabhupada's potency as Diksha Guru, even after his disappearance, with the perceived limitations of Diksha Gurus in ISKCON Mumbai, questioning the GBC's accusations against the Ritvik system.

in a customized manner specific to each disciple so that he goes back all the way to Goloka. This cannot be done by a Diksha Guru. Just like Bilumangal Thakur required a specific kind of dose of instruction which would awaken him and his Diksha Guru accordingly administered it through the prostitute. So, the Diksha Guru is a transcendental personality who is not limited by time and space. He is not dependent on being a quote-unquote living Guru to administer such specific Divya Jnana in the heart of his disciples. According to each disciple, no matter how many thousands of disciples he may have, he knows what instruction each disciple specifically requires. And Srila Prabhupada administers that for each of his disciples directly in their heart through different Diksha Gurus in his Khan, through his books, lectures, letters, etc. and also through other living entities in the world. And for all this, Srila Prabhupada need not even be physically present before the disciple. He need not even be quote-unquote living Guru. Just like thousands of Prabhupada's disciples before 1977 never even met Srila Prabhupada in their life or might have had just a brief glimpse of Prabhupada. But they all got wonderful spiritual realization, Divya Jnana and progressed steadily in spiritual life. In fact, Srila Prabhupada is not even bound to be within this material world in order to perform this role of Diksha Guru. He can be in Goloka and still he can do this for all his disciples whom he has initiated through the Rithvik system. That is the power and potency of Srila Prabhupada. That is how potent Prabhupada is. That is how powerful Prabhupada is. He can perform his function of Diksha Guru without having to be a quote-unquote living Guru. In comparison, the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON Mumbai group are so limited in their potency that they must be quote-unquote living in order to act as Diksha Guru. Once a Diksha Guru in ISKCON passes away, he stops being a Diksha Guru. So, you see how limited their potency is. But funny thing is, ISKCON Mumbai group's GBC accuses those who follow Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order saying that the Rithvik system renders Srila Prabhupada impotent. Now, you please tell us who is really potent? Srila Prabhupada or the unauthorized Diksha Gurus in ISKCON? Please let us know your thoughts in the comment section below about who is more potent? Srila Prabhupada or the unauthorized Diksha Gurus? Yes, go ahead. We are waiting for your comment. Please do it right now. There, you put in your comment. Great.

**Key Quote:** "Can the GBC confirm and assure unequivocally that all their NOC Diksha Gurus can impart realization in the hearts of their disciples up to giving them Swaroopa Siddhi?"
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa challenges the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai to confirm the potency of their approved Diksha Gurus, questioning their ability to deliver disciples to Goloka and impart Swaroopa Siddhi.

So, continuing our discussion, this raises another question. On the unauthorized Guru system in ISKCON, can the GBC of the ISKCON Mumbai group confirm that the Diksha Gurus that they give no objection to, will those Diksha Gurus deliver all their disciples to Goloka? We don't want to hear from rank and file devotees. We want the answer from the GBC. Will the GBC confirm that if the Diksha Gurus disciples in ISKCON do not go back to Goloka and are forced to again take birth in the material world, all the GBC NOC Diksha Gurus in ISKCON will come back from Goloka to take their disciples back? Can the GBC confirm this? Well, for that, first, the GBC has to confirm that all their NOC Gurus are going to go to Goloka after they are passing away. Can the GBC give such an assurance? Forget about the future. Can the GBC confirm that all their NOC Diksha Gurus who have passed away till now, are all of them in Goloka, monitoring their disciples and administering specific realizations for their disciples, just like Billo Mangal Thakur's Diksha Guru or as Shaila Prabhupada himself confirmed that he too is doing. Can the GBC confirm that all the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON who have passed away are doing this for their disciples after they have passed away? Some of the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON have 1000, 2000 or someone even 50,000 disciples. Are those unauthorized Diksha Gurus administering specific, Divya Jnana according to the specific requirement of each of their disciples, just as Shaila Prabhupada is doing even today for his disciples whom he initiated before 1977, as also for those disciples after 1977 through the Ritvik system of initiations, Prabhupada is still doing it. So, all those quote-unquote living Gurus who are there for their 1000, 2000, 10,000, 50,000 disciples, are they able to do while they are quote-unquote living? Which Prabhupada is doing without having the need to be a living Guru? If they cannot do that, even when they are living, then what is the use of initiating 50,000 disciples? Can the GBC confirm and assure unequivocally that all their NOC Diksha Gurus can impart realization in the hearts of their disciples up to giving them Swaroopa Siddhi? Well, if they have to give Swaroopa Siddhi to their disciples, the unauthorized Diksha Gurus in ISKCON first must be Swaroopa Siddhas themselves. But the GBC in their resolution number 409 of 2004 have said, when the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating, it does not thereby endorse him as an Attham Adhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. That means the GBC has already admitted, they have already confessed that their NOC Diksha Gurus have not achieved any realization. That means the unauthorized Diksha Gurus in ISKCON are not even on the stage of having realized that they are not the body. Forget about Swaroopa Siddhi. That is too far off. So, then what is the potency of the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON? If they are not Swaroopa Siddhas themselves, how will they give Swaroopa Siddhi to their disciples? And how will they, after their disappearance, how will they give specific realization to their disciples and give them Swaroopa Siddhi and take them back to Godhead?

**Key Quote:** "Then both of them will go to hell like blind men leading the blind."
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa questions the GBC's approval of Diksha Gurus who are not pure devotees, citing Srila Prabhupada's warning about the blind leading the blind, and expresses confidence in Srila Prabhupada's ability to deliver his disciples to Goloka.

What are the unauthorized Diksha Gurus doing for their disciples in ISKCON? Other than chanting on their beads and selecting their names, which is actually the role of the Rithvik. They accuse the Rithvik system of rendering Srila Prabhupada impotent. But what is their GBC NO objection Guru system rendering their Diksha Gurus? Is it making them potent? And if the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON are not potent to take anyone back to Goloka, forget about taking their Diksha Gurus. If they are not potent in going back to Goloka themselves, then what is the future of all their disciples? Srila Prabhupada in his letter to Tushta Krishna wrote this on 14th of December 1972. As for your next question, can only a few pure devotees deliver others? Anyone, if he is a pure devotee, he can deliver others. He can become spiritual master. But unless he is on that platform, he should not attempt it. Then both of them will go to hell like blind men leading the blind. So, unless one is a pure devotee, one must not attempt to become a Diksha Guru. But the GBC has confessed in resolution number 409 that none of their Diksha Gurus are pure devotees. So what is the GBC doing then? By giving NOC to those who are not pure devotees, as per their own admission, can they become Diksha Gurus? We will leave the responsibility of finding the answers for all these questions to you. As far as we, the devotees of Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group are concerned, we are blissfully confident that Srila Prabhupada will definitely take us back to Goloka since we are his disciples via the Rithvik system of initiations implemented according to Srila Prabhupada's July 9th, 1977 order. Of course, that also places a very heavy responsibility on our shoulders too as disciples of Srila Prabhupada to perfect our lives within this very lifetime and not create a situation where Srila Prabhupada has to come back to the material world to deliver us. So, let us seriously take shelter of our Diksha Guru, our Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada and execute our duties diligently following all the instructions of Srila Prabhupada and we can rest assured that Srila Prabhupada will personally take us to the point of Swaroopa Siddhi, to the point of Krishna Prema, to the point of our returning to Goloka and he will continue to guide and instruct and train us in our services to Radha and Krishna in Goloka Vrindavan.

**Key Quote:** "From childhood, if a man is educated that woman is not an object of enjoyment, she is to be respected like mother and she is worthy always of your protection, not your exploitation."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Manu Samhita's view on women's protection and Chanakya Pandit's teaching on respecting women as mothers, emphasizing protection over exploitation.

When Manu Samhita, Manu is saying that women have to be always protected, they should not be given independence, meaning they should not be let free. They should not be let free without protection at any point of time. Women are always to be accorded special protection. Not only that, we combine it with the statement which is given by Chanakya Pandit, who says that a learned person should always look upon every woman other than his wife as his mother. Now, from childhood, if a man is educated that woman is not an object of enjoyment, she is to be respected like mother, and she is worthy always of your protection, not your exploitation.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the high regard for women in ancient times, illustrating it with the example of Lord Ramachandra killing Ravana for abducting Sita, highlighting the consequences of disrespecting women.

Then what happens? Every man will have great respect towards every woman who is not, even though the woman may not be related to him. And that is how in the olden times, women were given so much respect that if a man were to abduct a woman, then according to the Shastras, the husband of that woman can go and kill that abductor, and there is no sin involved in this. And the most brilliant example of this is how Lord Ramachandra, he killed Ravana. Not only Ravana, Ravana's entire dynasty. Whoever stood in support of Ravana, all of them were killed by Ramachandra. For what? Just because of his one wife, Sita, who had been abducted by Ravana. Lord Ramachandra set the example.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the high position of women's honor in society according to Manusamhita, stating that disrespect towards women leads to conflict, citing Ramayana and Mahabharata as examples.

From this, what we can understand is the honor of a woman was accorded the highest position in the society, according to Manusamhita. Woman was to be highly respected. Children had to be respected. Women had to always take her wish as their command. This was the actual spirit of Manu's instructions in the Manusamhita. It was not for any sort of suppression or oppression or exploitation of any kind. Women were given so much respect, and whenever women would be disrespected, then it would result in some war or the other. Even Mahabharata, the war of Mahabharata and the war of Ramayana, both of the wars, if you see, were fought because the honor of a woman was insulted.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Mahabharata and Ramayana wars, explaining that they were fought to protect the honor of Draupadi and Sita, respectively, emphasizing the importance of following Manusamhita as Dharma and respecting women.

The Pandavas and the Kauravas were living together. Little bit skirmishes here and there used to happen. Little bit fight here and there used to happen, but it never used to be a full-fledged fight to death. But the day the Kauravas decided to insult Draupadi by trying to disrobe her, that day the seeds of their death in the battle were sown. That was the instance where the Pandavas decided that the Kauravas have to die because of the insult they have committed to Draupadi. Similarly, the day Ramana kidnapped Sita, that day his death was written. We can understand both the battles, both the great battles in our history have happened to protect the honor of a woman. That means the Manusamhita and the people in those days used to live by the Manusamhita, by the codes of the Manusamhita. That was the Dharma. Path of Dharma means we have to follow the Manusamhita. So people understood the spirit of Manu's instructions, and accordingly, the woman was given such high respect.

**Key Quote:** "That is real humility."
**Summary:** This segment defines humility according to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as giving respect to others without expecting any in return.

So, humility, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has defined, what is the definition of humility? Humility means Amanina Manadena. So, humility, the definition of humility given by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is very simple. What is that? To Amanina, we don't expect any respect for ourselves, and Manadena, we give all respect to others. Not that I don't expect any respect for myself and I don't respect you also. No, I give you all respect, and even though you may not respect me, I don't expect any respect for myself. Some people, they give lot of respect to others. Why? So that they also get respect in return. So, like it's said in English, give respect and take respect. So, why are they giving respect? So that they can take respect. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is saying, no, only give respect. Don't expect or take any respect for yourself. That is real humility.

**Summary:** Real humility arises from understanding our position as eternal servants of Krishna through devotional service and studying scriptures.

So, real humility can come when we understand our truth, true position as servants, as eternal servants of Krishna. So, unless and until we understand our position as eternal servants of Krishna, real humility cannot take place in our heart. So, real humility is when we understand our insignificant position. So, by associating with devotees, by reading Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, understanding the position of Krishna and understanding our miniscule insignificant position, we can become humble.

### How the GBC changed Deity worship in ISKCON | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

**Content Type:** historical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This system was given a stamp of approval and finality by the GBC in the year 1995."
**Summary:** The speaker outlines the GBC's resolutions in 1989 regarding Deity worship, the formation of a research committee, and the publication of the Pancharatra Pradipa in 1995, detailing the procedures for Aarati as described in the manual.

On March 11, 1989, ISKCON Mumbai Group's GBC passed two resolutions regarding Deity worship in ISKCON, Resolutions No. 65 and 66. Resolution No. 65 reads that the GBC body hereby requests the following devotees to research on the basis of Guru, Sadhu and Shastra to help establish ISKCON policies regarding Deity worship – Bhanuswami, Bhakti Vidyapurna Swami, Atma-Tattva, Jananivas, Ashtaratha and Krishna Kshetra. Jagadeesha Goswami is appointed to coordinate the research work. This resolution was followed by Resolution No. 66 which read that the Deity worship research group and the full GBC body must approve the contents of the ISKCON Deity worship handbook before publication. So, in 1989, the GBC felt that Deity worship policies need to be set and for that they need the help of Shastra. A committee was made as per this decision, which in the following years, underwent some modifications to the constituent members of the committee. This committee did its research and submitted its report to the GBC. The GBC finally published the Deity worship manual in the year 1995 under the ISKCON GBC Press calling it the Pancharatra Pradipa. In this Deity worship manual, the procedure for Aarati is described as follows. In addition to the worship of Srila Prabhupada in his Guru Puja, one should also honour him when performing Aarati by presenting the Aarati items to Srila Prabhupada after presenting them to one's own spiritual master, then with the consciousness that you are offering it on behalf of your spiritual master and with the blessings of Srila Prabhupada and Lord Chaitanya, offer it with the full number of circles listed below to the main Deity. After offering the incense to the main Deity, offer it as Prasada to the Lord's associates in descending order and to the Guru Parampara Sr. to Jr. This may be done with seven or three circles for each personality depending on time allowance. Then distribute it with one or three circles to the assembled Vaishnavas as the Prasada of the Lord and his associates. So, as per the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group, Aarati has to be offered in descending order. And how to offer the Aarati to the Deity? That is also described in the Pancharathra Pradipa, which says under the heading, how to offer each item as follows. Offer all the items, except the chamara and fan, by moving them in clockwise circles while ringing a bell with your left hand above waist level, fixing your attention on the Deities. Lamp: How to offer a lamp? That is described here. Lamp: Offer four circles to the lotus feet, two circles to the navel, and three circles to the Lord's face. Then offer seven circles to the Lord's whole body. Then the second one: Argya in a conch. Offer three circles to the Lord's head and seven circles to the whole body of the Lord. Then pour a small amount of the offered Argya into the Visarjaniya Patra, small throat pot, before proceeding to offer Argya to the next personality. Aarati Argya, plain or scented water. Then comes the cloth. Offer seven times around the Lord's body. Flowers: Offer seven times around the Lord's body. Chamara: Wave before the Lord a suitable number of times. Fan: Wave before the Lord a suitable number of times. So in 1995, the GBC approved the Manual for Deity Worship where when a devotee offers Aarati, he presents the Aarati to his Guru, then to Srila Prabhupad as a matter of honoring them and taking blessings from them. Then the arathi actually starts by offering it to Krishna first. 4, 2, 3, 7 formula for lamparathi, 3, 7 formula for water, etc. The key point is that the arathi offering begins with offering to Krishna on behalf of your spiritual master and then the prasadam is offered to Radharani, then to Mahaprabhu, then to Nithyananda Prabhu and then to Srila Prabhupada and then to your Guru.

**Key Quote:** "So, you see, no 4-2-3-7 formula. Straight seven circles. That's it. That means, the 4-2-3-7 aarti introduced by the GBC in the 90s is an outright deviation in deity worship."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the GBC's Aarati procedures with Srila Prabhupada's instructions, citing letters where Prabhupada emphasizes offering to the Guru first and using seven circles, arguing that the GBC's changes are deviations.

This system was given a stamp of approval and finality by the GBC in the year 1995. Now, we must note that Srila Prabhupada had already established a systematic and elaborate system of Deity worship in ISKCON. Srila Prabhupada not only established the standards of Deity worship, Srila Prabhupada also ran it under his personal supervision in all the temples in ISKCON from 1967 till 1977. That is 10 straight years, if not longer. And this same system that Srila Prabhupada established continued for another 18 years or so till 1995 when the Pancharatrapadeepa came out. So, what was the system that Srila Prabhupada established for offering aarti to the deities? What was the original system? Was it the same as that instructed by the GBC in the Pancharatrapadeepa? Let us look at a few of Srila Prabhupada's directions in this regard. In a letter to Aniruddha dated 14th of November 1968, Srila Prabhupada instructed, aarti is performed at one and a half hour before sunrise to awaken the deities. Each offering is made by moving it in seven big circles, starting at the lotus feet of the Lord and going clockwise round. So, you see, no 4-2-3-7 formula. Straight seven circles. That's it. That means, the 4-2-3-7 aarti introduced by the GBC in the 90s is an outright deviation in deity worship. Are you stunned? Hold your breath because the worst is yet to come. Next comes the sequence of offering the aarti. In another letter to Giriraj, dated 28th of May 1972, Srila Prabhupada instructed, so far your question regarding deity worship during aarti, everything should be offered first to the Guru. So, Srila Prabhupada instructed to offer first to Guru, not to Krishna. And in his letter to Hemavathy dated 1st April 1970, Srila Prabhupada gave even greater clarity on the sequence or order of doing the aarti. Srila Prabhupada wrote, You have asked some questions. The order of worshipping is 1st spiritual master, 2. then Lord Chaitanya, then Radha Krishna, as in the mantras or Bendeyam prayer. So, here, very clearly, Srila Prabhupada gave an even greater clarity on the sequence and the position of doing the aarti. Very clearly, Srila Prabhupada said that we have to follow the sequence of Vandeyam prayers. And what is the sequence of Vandeyam prayers? First Guru, which is Srila Prabhupada, then Savadhootham or Sri Nithyananda Prabhu, then Lord Chaitanya, then Radha and then finally Krishna. It is the ascending order, not the descending order which the GBC has now implemented in ISKCON. Descending way is the procedure which was established by Srila Prabhupada for Deity worship in ISKCON from 1967 till 1977. And ISKCON continued with that system till in the late 80s or 90s, the GBC decided to change it entirely. Both the sequence of offering Aarati by completely reversing the order to begin the Aarati with Krishna, and also the number of times from just 7 straight times to 4, 2, 3, 7 etc. This is an outright outrageous deviation by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group. What audacity they must be having to change the Deity worship system. Is there no one in ISKCON to question such pernicious deviations by the GBC? Don't the GBC understand they are playing with something? Are they playing with something more dangerous than dynamite with the Deities? What is everyone doing in ISKCON? Are they all sleeping?

#### Bhoga offering, Srila Prabhupada's instructions, GBC deviations, Guru Parampara

**Key Quote:** "The GBC has completely changed the way of offering."
**Summary:** The speaker compares the GBC's instructions on Bhoga offering in the Pancharatra Pradipa with Srila Prabhupada's instructions, highlighting the GBC's emphasis on offering directly to the deities versus Prabhupada's instruction to offer through the spiritual master.

As if this itself were not enough, brace yourself for even worse deviation by the GBC. Look at what they did with the Bhoga offering procedure to the Deities. When it comes to Bhoga offering, the Pancharatara Pradipa of 1995, published by the ISKCON GBC Press states, dates, section called Offering the Bhoga. Offer the Bhoga and drinking water with a hand gesture to each deity, showing the plate and saying, My dear Lordships, Gaur Nithay, Jagannath Baldev Subhadra, etc., please accept this offering of nice food. My dear Lordships, Gaur Nithay, Jagannath Baldev Subhadra, etc., please accept this beverage. Then the Pancharatra Pratipa states, While ringing a bell, chant the Pranam prayers to your spiritual master three times, begging permission to assist him in serving the deities. After offering everything to the deities like this, the Pancharatra Pratipa instructs the devotee as follows, Leave the deity room and chant the Gayatri mantras. You may chant all the Guru-given mantras at this time. Meditate on the Lord Yudhisthira. After the offering is completed, the bhoga is offered to the deities and then permission from the guru is sought to assist him in serving the deities. When removing the prasadam plates, the Pancharatra Pratipa instructs, Offer the lord's prasada remnants to the spiritual master and the Lord's associates. After this the plates are to be removed. So, the system here too is to offer the bhoga first to the deities and then offer their prasadam to Shaila Prabhupada and to the Diksha Guru. Descending process once more. Now again, what was the system Shaila Prabhupada set up and ran for 10 years or more in ISKCON and which continued in ISKCON till about 1995? Let us look at what Shaila Prabhupada instructed about offering bhoga to the deities. In this letter to Arundhati dated June 16, 1969, Shaila Prabhupada instructed, regarding your question about offering prasadam, whatever is offered to the deity, actually it goes through the spiritual master. The spiritual master offers to Lord Chaitanya and Lord Chaitanya offers it to Krishna. Then Radha Krishna eats or Jagannath eats. Then Chaitanya Mahaprabhu eats. Then the spiritual master eats and it becomes Mahaprasadam. So, when you offer something, you think like that and chant the Gayathri mantra and then everything is complete. At last, ring the bell, take out the plate and wipe the place where the plate was kept. The GBC in the Pancharatra Pradipa instructs the devotee to meditate that Krishna is eating the bhoga. Whereas, Shaila Prabhupada instructed to meditate on offering to the guru and the guru will offer to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu will offer to Krishna. The GBC has completely changed the way of offering. This is a shocking deviation by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group. In another letter to Jathurani, dated 15 February, 1968, Shaila Prabhupada wrote, regarding offering food. Shaila Prabhupada says the custom is to offer the foodstuff first to the spirit. Show of hands is the custom of offering foodstuff. This is also a custom, spiritual master. We cannot do anything directly. The spiritual master accepts the offering on behalf of his disciple and offers the same to Krishna. After Krishna's eating, the spiritual master eats it and then the devotees take it as Mahaprasadam. This is the system. Everything

is offered to the spiritual master first with the prayer Nama Om Vishnupadaya. So, you see, Srila Prabhupada instructed that we cannot offer anything directly to Krishna. We must first offer to Guru. Srila Prabhupada reiterated this in another discussion after a lecture given on Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 6, Chapter 3, Verse 24, given on the occasion of his divine grace, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada's appearance day, recorded in Gorakhpur on February 15, 1970. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada's appearance day, recorded on 23 May 2001. Not a special thing if that. The process is that whatever you offer to the Deity, that is offered to Guru and Guru offers to his guru. This way goes to Krishna. You do not directly offer another Krishna. No. You have no right. Neither you accept. The picture of this acara is these. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Ācāryas fight there. Actually, one has to offer the plate to his guru, and he'll offer his guru. He'll offer his guru, his guru. In this way it will go. That is the process. You cannot directly approach Kṛṣṇa or other subordinates to Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. As we do, that is all right. The process is this. Not you or you. That is the process. You are not allowed. So, here, Srila Prabhupāda emphatically stated that we have no right to offer anything to Kṛṣṇa directly. Srila Prabhupāda gave such crystal clear instructions that we cannot offer anything directly to Kṛṣṇa, but we must offer to Guru first. And what did the GBC do in the Pancharatra Pradipa? They have said that the bhoga has to be offered directly to Kṛṣṇa. This is beyond shocking. This is mind-boggling. This is mind-numbing. Doesn't the GBC have any fear of Kṛṣṇa and Srila Prabhupāda's anger? Doesn't the GBC have any fear of Guru aparādhā? Doesn't the GBC have any fear in behaving as if they are better than their Guru Mahārāj, Srila Prabhupāda? Why on earth did the GBC have to make such a catastrophic change? Why did they deviate so monstrously? Was it because they knew?

#### Guru fall-downs, GBC motives, Deviations, Srila Prabhupada as Diksa Guru, July 9th Order

**Key Quote:** "Devotees of our group, Śrīla Prabhupāda's ISKCON group, can rest assured that we strictly follow the standard of offering ārati and bhoga exactly as Śrīla Prabhupāda instructed."
**Summary:** The speaker speculates on the GBC's motives for the changes, linking it to Guru fall-downs and a potential desire to bypass offering through potentially fallen Gurus, and concludes by affirming his group's adherence to Srila Prabhupada's original instructions, particularly the July 9th order, emphasizing Prabhupada as the sole Diksa Guru.

That their Dīkṣa Gurus are not bona fide and offering through them would be outrightly rejected by Kṛṣṇa and so they reversed the whole procedure, offering directly to Kṛṣṇa? In most Guru fall-downs in ISKCON, the GBC tries to suppress the news, brushing it under the carpet. When the news finally breaks, several months of the Guru's deviation and fall-down would have already passed. So, naturally, questions will be raised by all the disciples of the fallen Guru as to what happened to all the bhoga and ārati that was being offered in the temples by His disciples from the time the Guru fell-down. Was it because the GBC had no answer for such questions that they found a quick-fix solution? Offer to Kṛṣṇa directly instead of offering to the Guru, and offer the Guru only prasādam. The Guru is the last person in the descending order in the line. So, even if Guru has fallen down, no problem. Is that the reason why the GBC made such an unbelievable change in the process of Deity worship? Look at what one deviation of the GBC, one disobedience of the GBC in 1978 to Śrīla Prabhupāda's July 9th order has led to. They are playing with the spiritual lives of the devotees without any qualms. Downright disgusting and appalling. How can the GBC even walk with their heads held high after such preposterous deviations? This deviation of the GBC is beyond atrocious. It is actually criminal. But it serves as a stark reminder of even just one deviation. How even just one disobedience of Śrīla Prabhupāda's one instruction, the July 9th, 1977 order to implement the Hrithik system of initiations, just that one deviation can cause so much havoc and destruction of the spiritual lives of thousands of devotees. Devotees of our group, Śrīla Prabhupāda's ISKCON group, can rest assured that we strictly follow the standard of offering ārati and bhoga exactly as Śrīla Prabhupāda instructed. Everything is offered to Śrīla Prabhupāda first because we follow the July 9th order of Śrīla Prabhupāda to implement Hrithik initiations. Hence, we happily and blissfully offer every ārati, every bhoga directly first to Śrīla Prabhupāda because Śrīla Prabhupāda is, Śrīla Prabhupāda was and Śrīla Prabhupāda will always, eternally be the sole dikṣa guru for every single devotee in our group, Śrīla Prabhupāda's ISKCON group.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the pursuit of material pleasures and how Prabhupada's books can lead to detachment from these desires.

We spend our whole life trying to acquire material pleasures. We go to college, study very hard. Why? Because I want to get good marks. So we work hard, two years, three years, four years, doing our engineering or whatever, five years in case of doctors, study hard, write all the exams, day and night, burn the midnight oil and get good marks. Finally, at the end of it, we get a degree. And finally, when we come to the final year, we start preparing for the campus interviews. And then when you get a job, you start working hard. I should work in such a way that at the end of the year, my annual appraisals are good and I get either an increment or a promotion. But suddenly, when we read Prabhupada's books, what happened? All that passion we had for studying, getting good marks, getting a good job, what happened to all that? All simply vanished into thin air. No more you are interested. How? How? Because when we come in touch, we come in touch with the instructions of Prabhupada. Prabhupada is directly bestowing the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu upon us. In our heart, we lose all the consideration, all the attraction.

**Summary:** Rishabhadeva advises his sons about the futility of sense gratification, the temporary nature of the material body, and the importance of understanding one's true identity as a servant of Krishna.

Rishabhadeva tells his sons that in this material world, the people are engaged in all kinds of sinful activities because they want to satisfy their senses. In my opinion, this is not at all a good thing to do, because this body for which the people are toiling so hard is asat. It is temporary. At the point of death, one has to give up all the results of one's hard work and one has to go. And in the midst of this, we engage in so much enmity with other people. They don't think about the repercussions of their action. It can never satisfy them. After a certain point, they become frustrated, become very renounced, and they start saying, "I am the supreme Brahman." After some time, they will again come back to the material conception. We have to understand that my actual factual position is...

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada, on 9th of July, 1977, issued a written directive to the whole of ISKCON, detailing a Rithvik system of initiations to be followed in ISKCON."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the July 9th Directive, explaining its context and purpose regarding the Rithvik system of initiations.

Hare Krishna! Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki Jai! Srila Prabhupada, on 9th of July, 1977, issued a written directive to the whole of ISKCON, detailing a Rithvik system of initiations to be followed in ISKCON. In this directive, Srila Prabhupada appointed 11 devotees to act as his representatives, also called Rithviks, to initiate disciples on his behalf. The newly initiated disciples would be Srila Prabhupada's disciples. This directive, July 9th directive, was actually the outcome of a GBC meeting with Srila Prabhupada on 28th of May, 1977, where they asked Srila Prabhupada what would be the system of conducting initiations in ISKCON, particularly at the time when Prabhupada was no longer with us. Tamalkrishna Goswami, who was Srila Prabhupada's secretary at that time, typed out the directive on July 9th, 1977, and he took Prabhupada's signature on it, and he sent it out to all the GBCs and temple presidents at that time.

#### Guru system, Tamal Krishna Goswami's claim, Contradiction, ISKCON's stance

**Key Quote:** "Tamalkrishna Goswami claimed that the July 9th letter was his letter, not Srila Prabhupada's."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Tamal Krishna Goswami's later claim that he authored the July 9th letter and the implications for the current Guru system in ISKCON.

However, after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance in November of 1977, in the year 1978, all the 11 people appointed as Rithviks were elevated by the GBC to become Diksha Gurus. They claimed at that time, that Srila Prabhupada had appointed or selected these 11 people as Diksha Gurus. Several years later, Tamalkrishna Goswami claimed that the July 9th letter was his letter, not Srila Prabhupada's. He said that Srila Prabhupada did not dictate or write the letter, but he did. So, it was his letter, not Srila Prabhupada's. So, he gave this explanation to justify his and others. He said that he was a Guru. Then, there is no other order by Srila Prabhupada for anyone to become a Guru in ISKCON. The letter was written by me. It was not dictated by Prabhupada. It was signed by me, and it's my letter. It's not Prabhupada's letter. So, it's just astounding to me that somehow my letter turns out to be the final order. And it was my suggestion that Prabhupada approved it, because I thought it would add weight to it, so people would know it was authorized. And it's just astounding how this becomes the basis of a new understanding of the Sampradaya. This video of Tamal Krishna Goswami is cited by the supporters of the self-appointed Guru system in ISKCON, saying that July 9th directive is not the final order, since it didn't come from Srila Prabhupada at all. It was Tamal Krishna Goswami's letter. So, it appears like ISKCON is now disowning

the July 9th Directive from Srila Prabhupada. Actually, with this argument, the self-appointed Gurus are honestly shooting themselves in the foot. The devotees of ISKCON Bangalore, of course, we are not buying this argument. However, for the sake of argument, let us hypothetically assume that the July 9th Directive was not Srila Prabhupada's letter, but it was Tamalkrishna Goswami's. Well, if this was Tamalkrishna Goswami's letter, then the question comes, who appointed the 11 people as Ritwiks? Was it Tamalkrishna Goswami? Did Tamalkrishna Goswami have the powers to appoint Ritwiks in ISKCON? Did he really have that kind of power? The answer is obviously a resounding no, because what was Tamalkrishna Goswami? Tamalkrishna Goswami, at that time, was just a mere secretary to Srila Prabhupada, nothing more. He had no power to appoint anyone in ISKCON. Forget about Ritwiks. The second question that crops up is that the July 9th Directive was addressed to all the GBCs and temple precedence. If this was not Prabhupada's letter, but Tamalkrishna Goswami's letter, did Tamal Krishna Goswami, just as a simple secretary, did he have the powers to direct the entire GBCs and temple presidents, which means the entire movement? Is there any order from Srila Prabhupada that said that he was conferring such powers on Tamal Krishna Goswami? In reality, none. Only Srila Prabhupada had such powers. Therefore, July 9 directive is

undeniably from Srila Prabhupada only. It cannot be from Tamal Krishna Goswami. Moreover, the 11 people named in the July 9 directive became diksha gurus in 1978. How? By claiming that Srila Prabhupada appointed them, selected them. The GBC resolution number 16 of 1978 stated, the GBC will consider each year at Gaurapurnima the appointment of new spiritual masters to be approved by a three-fourth vote. However, for 1978, no new spiritual master shall be appointed other than the 11 selected by Shela Prabhupada. So, in this resolution by the GBC, and mind you, Tamalkrishna Goswami was one of the GBC members. So, he has also been part of this resolution. So, in this resolution, it is clearly mentioned by the GBC, in which Tamalkrishna Goswami was also a member, that the 11 people were selected by Shela Prabhupada. At that time, why did Tamalkrishna Goswami not tell them? Why did he not tell them that these are not selected by Prabhupada, they are selected by me, because this is my letter, not Prabhupada's

letter. Why did he not tell at that time? But these 11 names, because you have to understand that these 11 names, which are mentioned here in this resolution, appeared only in the July 9th, 1977 directive, and that too as Ritwiks, not as Gurus. And there is no other document from Shela Prabhupada where these 11 names are mentioned. So, the 11 people becoming Gurus is coming out of the July 9th directive. And what is Tamalkrishna Goswami saying? Later, he is claiming that it is his letter. So, are these 11 Gurus appointed by Tamalkrishna Goswami? They claimed, these 11 people, they claimed that the July 9th directive was temporary, only till Shela Prabhupada's departure from this world. And after Prabhupada's departure, they were not selected. So, they were not selected. So, they were not selected. So, they became Gurus. So, the next question that comes is, if July 9th letter is Tamalkrishna Goswami's letter, then does it mean that the GBC resolution number 16, which says Prabhupada selected them, is that GBC resolution wrong? That Shela Prabhupada did not select the 11 people, but Tamalkrishna Goswami selected, appointed himself, turned 10 others to become Gurus after Shela Prabhupada's disappearance? Is this the meaning that the GBC of today wants to convey by disowning the July 9th directive as Tamalkrishna Goswami's letter? So, does that mean ISKCON is following Tamalkrishna Goswami in indicating no objections to devotees to become Diksha Gurus in ISKCON? What is ISKCON trying to tell us by disowning the July 9th directive? They are actually saying that Tamalkrishna Goswami is following Tamalkrishna Goswami, trying to question the validity of the Rithvik system by disowning the July 9th directive.

**Summary:** The speaker points out the contradictions between the GBC's 1978 resolution and their later confession in 1999 regarding the unauthorized zonal acharya system.

But instead, what are they achieving? All that they are achieving is to raise serious questions on their own unauthorized, self-appointed Guru system. ISKCON, GBC, in fact, contradicted their resolution number 16 of 1978 later on, and they confessed that Shela Prabhupada, as they claimed in resolution number 16 of 1978, was a Guru. So, Tamalkrishna Goswami is following Tamalkrishna Goswami in his confession. As they had claimed in that, it was not true. Shela Prabhupada did not select or appoint any Gurus in ISKCON in 1978. So, this confession came in 1999 from the GBC when they passed this resolution number 403, which reads, whereas Shela Prabhupada established ISKCON in 1966 and prior to his disappearance in November 1977, he stated in his will that there was no GBC is the ultimate managerial authority for the society. Unfortunately, shortly after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance, the GBC body, not Prabhupada, the GBC body allowed for an unauthorized zonal acharya system to evolve in ISKCON, elevating 11 exclusive successor diksha gurus.

**Key Quote:** "The GBC body allowed for elevating 11 exclusive successor diksha gurus."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the GBC's admission that they elevated the 11 successor diksha gurus, questioning their authority to do so and labeling the entire diksha guru system in ISKCON as unauthorized.

So, the GBC body allowed for elevating 11 exclusive successor diksha gurus. In 1978, what did the GBC say? They said Srila Prabhupada selected the 11 people. In 1999, the GBC is saying the GBC body allowed for elevating 11 diksha gurus. So, in this resolution, the GBC is clearly saying that they elevated 11 successor diksha gurus. That means, Srila Prabhupada did not appoint any diksha gurus in ISKCON. The GBC did. Now, what you see is, GBC in 1978 said that Srila Prabhupada selected the 11 people. In 1999, they said, no, Prabhupada did not do it. We did it. And now, in 2025, the GBC is saying that the July 9th directive is not Prabhupada's, it is Tamalkrishna Goswami's. Anyway, coming back to the point, the GBC is saying in 1999 that they elevated 11 people as diksha gurus. So, the question is, who gave the GBC the powers to appoint diksha gurus? Do they have any written order from Srila Prabhupada to do so? Or maybe in some conversation, Prabhupada authorized them. Can the GBC produce such an order? Reality is, there is no such order. Hence, entire diksha guru system in ISKCON,

is unauthorized because it is authorized by a GBC which has no authority to do so. The reality, what is the reality? The reality is that there was a discussion with Srila Prabhupada on 7th of July 1977, regarding who all could be appointed as his deputies or as his representatives. Srila Prabhupada mentioned all the 11 names in that conversation. And as Srila Prabhupada's secretary, and the Chairman of the GBC Entertainment Company, those names are all mentioned. It was not as that in the session 12 fr verändert the이면 of the Discipline, it was not as that in the audience. So, it was not as that in the session 12 years prior, and it was not as that in the session 13 years before. Tamal Krishna Goswami's duty to put it in writing and inform everyone about Srila Prabhupada's order. So, based on this order of Srila Prabhupada and based on the May 28th, 1977 meeting of the GBC with Srila Prabhupada, the July 9th directive was typed out by Tamal Krishna Goswami. Prabhupada saw that, Prabhupada signed it and then it was sent out to all the GBCs and TPs. Since Srila Prabhupada had signed it, all the GBCs and TPs who received the directive accepted it as Srila Prabhupada's order. Nobody thought it was Tamal Krishna Goswami's order. Actually, we devotees of ISKCON Bangalore also even today accept that it is Srila Prabhupada's order, it is not Tamal Krishna Goswami's order. So, please do not be swayed by such illegitimate claims by Tamal Krishna Goswami or the self-appointed Gurus of ISKCON. Please remain firm in following Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive for Diksha in ISKCON by Rittviks or representatives of Srila Prabhupada. Everyone in ISKCON is a disciple of Srila Prabhupada. No one is authorized to be Diksha Guru in ISKCON. Diksha Guru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai! Vishwa Guru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai! Hare Krishna!

**Summary:** The speaker claims that guru fall downs resulted from disobeying Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive regarding Rithvik initiations.

The GBC banned all of Srila Prabhupada's letters. Within one year, since 1978, devotees started developing doubts. The devotees in ISKCON had been deceived. Only the GBCs at that time knew of the July 9th directive. The guru fall downs are a direct reaction of disobeying Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive to conduct initiations in ISKCON via Rithviks on behalf of Srila Prabhupada.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the argument that the Rithvik system was invented by disgruntled devotees reacting to problems within ISKCON, including the zonal acharya system and mistreatment by leaders.

Hare Krishna Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai. One argument against the Rithvik system of initiations is that it came out as a reaction to some gurus falling down in ISKCON. Another version of this argument is that the reaction came due to the problems arising out of the zonal acharya system. Yet another version of this argument is that the reaction came due to the misbehavior of some leaders of ISKCON with rank and file devotees, mistreating them. This argument, in essence, maintains that the Rithvik system was a new invention developed by some devotees who were victims of some unsavory dealings by leaders or gurus in ISKCON. This is a very patronizing approach. Either the victims, or at least those who sympathized with the victims, came up with this new theory of Rithvikism. To put it bluntly, it was the invention of some disgruntled devotees of ISKCON. Gurus or leaders fell from grace or dealt harshly with some devotees and as a

**Summary:** The speaker continues to dissect the argument against the Rithvik system, highlighting the perceived patronizing approach and questioning the expulsion of devotees who support it.

result, the devotees came up with the idea of Rithvik initiations. This argument, in its various versions, attempts to discredit the Rithvik system as a post-1978 invention by some disgruntled devotees who wished well for the organization, but the solution they came up with was not correct. So, this was a patronizing approach, as if we sympathize with these devotees, but they were incorrect in the institution. Therefore, the Rithvik solution that they came out with. So, if you are sympathizing with the devotees, the victims of all this mistreatment within ISKCON, then why are you supporting the expulsion of such devotees, which is encapsulated by the GBC as a law in ISKCON? If you are really sympathetic towards the devotees, expulsion should not be the solution. Anyway, to get to the bottom of this

**Key Quote:** "In March of 1978, the GBC in their Resolution No. 16 lied to all the Vaishnavas of ISKCON that Srila Prabhupada selected 11 devotees to become Diksha Gurus."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the historical context, focusing on the GBC's alleged deception regarding the appointment of 11 Diksha Gurus and the banning of Srila Prabhupada's letters.

argument, we will have to go back in history to the year 1978. In March of 1978, the GBC, in their Resolution No. 16, lied to all the Vaishnavas of ISKCON that Srila Prabhupada selected 11 devotees to become Diksha Gurus. The GBC themselves have admitted to this in their apology to the institution in 1999 in Resolution No. 403. But in 1978, when they lied that 11 devotees had been selected as Diksha Gurus, all the devotees naively believed them. A few, whoever asked where Srila Prabhupada had selected them, were met with a standard response: there is an appointment tape. That tape, however, was never released. So, devotees left it at that. Moreover, we have to understand, in the aftermath of Srila Prabhupada leaving the world, all the devotees must have been in a state of shock and immense grief. Naturally, in that state of anguish, they couldn't be expected to look at things too critically. To add to this, the GBC banned all of Srila Prabhupada's letters in ISKCON. No devotee in ISKCON could read any of Srila Prabhupada's letters. Can you imagine that? It was forbidden.

**Key Quote:** "However, within one year since 1978, as the dust started settling in the horizon, devotees started developing doubts."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how devotees began to doubt the appointed gurus, focusing on Jadurani Mataji's investigation and her demand to hear the 'appointment tape' from Rameswar Swami.

So, there was no way any devotee could lay his hands on the July 9, 1977 Directive. They simply did not know that such an order existed. However, within one year since 1978, as the dust started settling in the horizon, devotees started developing doubts. In just two years, by 1980, Jadurani Mataji was convinced that these Gurus were not what they claimed to be, to be pure devotees. There were some mutually disrespectful dealings between two of the 11 Diksha Gurus, which Jadurani Mataji happened to witness. That made her draw this conclusion that they could not be pure devotees. At that time, Jadurani Mataji was serving as one of the top book distributors in Los Angeles temple, and Los Angeles temple was also the headquarters of BBT at that time. Rameswar Swami, who was one of the 11 Diksha Gurus, was heading the Los Angeles temple and the BBT at that time. So, Jadurani Mataji went to Rameswar Swami and from Rameswar Swami, she demanded proof about the appointment of the 11 Diksha Gurus by Srila Prabhupada.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Rameswar Swami, after being confronted with the truth, conducted a Rithvik initiation, declaring himself a representative of Srila Prabhupada and the initiates as Srila Prabhupada's disciples.

She wanted to hear the appointment tape. Rameswar Swami was unable to evade her, and since he was in charge of BBT, he had access to all the tapes. And on her determinedly strong persuasion, he reluctantly gave Jadurani Mataji the recording of the May 28th GBC meeting with everyone. This is what they were calling as the appointment tape at that time. But after Jadurani Mataji heard the tape, it was clear to her that she and the rest of the devotees in ISKCON had been deceived. They had been duped. She confronted Rameswar Swami, who had no answers to her indignant questions. Backed with guilt, a highly repentant Rameswar Swami, what did he do? He removed his Vyasasana from the temple and he stopped this Guru Puja in the Los Angeles temple. A few days later, Rameswar Swami oversaw an initiation ceremony in the Los Angeles temple for a few devotees. During that initiation ceremony, in the class, this was in the year 1980, he declared that he was only a devotee. He was only a representative of Srila Prabhupada and all of the devotees who were getting initiated, they were disciples of Srila Prabhupada. Some of those devotees who were initiated in that ceremony till today, consider themselves disciples of Srila Prabhupada only, not of Rameswar Swami.

#### GBC, Rameswar Swami, Jadurani Mataji, expulsion, zonal acharyas

**Key Quote:** "They threatened to remove him from BBT and to expel him from ISKCON, unless he withdrew the Rithvik initiation."
**Summary:** The speaker details the GBC's reaction to Rameswar Swami's actions, his subsequent retraction under duress, and Jadurani Mataji's expulsion, highlighting that Rameswar Swami and Tamal Krishna Goswami were zonal acharyas.

Anyway, the moment the GBC came to know of this, a team of them landed up in Los Angeles, and they berated Rameswar Swami. They threatened to remove him from BBT and to expel him from ISKCON, unless he withdrew the Rithvik initiation, because this initiation what he conducted was actually a Rithvik initiation. Poor Rameswar Swami, under duress, called the devotees and announced that he was withdrawing his earlier statement and that the initiates were his disciples. And Jadurani Mataji, she was physically expelled from the temple. So, we can see that the first incident of Rithvik initiations was conducted in ISKCON in the year 1980. Coincidentally, in the same year, in a separate and unrelated incident, Tamal Krishna Goswami declared in the Topango Canyon discussions, the famous Topango Canyon discussions, he declared that Srila Prabhupada appointed only Rithviks and not Diksha Gurus. So, in both these cases, we see that Rameswar Swami, who conducted the first Rithvik initiation in ISKCON after 1978, as well as Tamal Krishna Goswami, who declared that Srila Prabhupada appointed only Rithviks and not Diksha Gurus, we see that both of them were not victims of any sort of improper behavior, nor were they at the receiving end of the zonal acharya system or any guru fall downs. In fact, they were themselves zonal acharyas. They were not some nondescript disgruntled devotees. They were Diksha Gurus and zonal acharyas. They were GBCs and top leaders in ISKCON.

#### Rithvik system, Srila Prabhupada's order, July 9th directive, May 28 GBC meeting

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In reality, both of them independently raised the Rithvik initiation system because neither of them invented or came up with the Rithvik system."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that Rameswar Swami and Tamal Krishna Goswami advocated for the Rithvik system not as a reaction to problems, but because they knew it was Srila Prabhupada's order, referencing the July 9th directive and May 28th GBC meeting.

They obviously cannot be victims of themselves and their own system. Then, why did they come up with the Rithvik system? In reality, both of them independently raised the Rithvik initiation system because neither of them invented or came up with the Rithvik system, but instead, they both knew that this was what Srila Prabhupada had ordered on July 9, 1977. The Rithvik system of initiations was Srila Prabhupada's order. In fact, only the GBCs at that time knew of the Rithvik system and the July 9 directive. No one else in ISKCON knew about it because the letters were banned until much later after 1987. So, historical evidence does not support the theory that the Rithvik system of initiations was invented as a reaction to the problems of the zonal acharya system or the guru fall downs or due to the mistreatment of some devotees by some ISKCON leaders. Historical evidence clearly favors the fact that the Rithvik system of initiations was specifically ordered by Srila Prabhupada on July 9, 1977, particularly for that time when Srila Prabhupada is no longer with us, as it is clear from the May 28 GBC meeting with Srila Prabhupada, which is the precursor to the July 9 directive.

#### Rithvik system, guru fall downs, July 9 directive, unauthorized guru system

**Key Quote:** "The guru fall downs and excesses of the zonal acharya system are a direct reaction of disobeying Shaila Prabhupada's July 9 directive to conduct initiations in ISKCON via Rithviks on behalf of Shaila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the Rithvik system is not a reaction to guru fall downs, but rather the guru fall downs are a result of disobeying Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive, emphasizing the directive as the sole authorization for Rithvik initiations.

For a detailed analysis of the May 28 meeting and the July 9 directive, please see the link below in the description. So, to conclude, from the history of ISKCON, we can see that the claim that the Rithvik system was a reaction to the guru fall downs and excesses of the zonal acharya system falls flat on its face. The Rithvik system has nothing to do with the guru fall downs. Whether gurus fell or not, irrespective of that, the Rithvik system is the only system authorized by Srila Prabhupada for carrying on initiations in ISKCON after his Thiro Bhava. Even if no gurus ever fell down in ISKCON, our stance will not change. In fact, rather than the Rithvik system coming up as a reaction to the guru fall downs or excesses of the zonal acharya system, the fact is the reverse. The guru fall downs and excesses of the zonal acharya system are a direct reaction of disobeying Srila Prabhupada's July 9 directive to conduct initiations in ISKCON via Rithviks on behalf of Srila Prabhupada. So, the claim that the Rithvik system of initiations is a reaction to guru fall downs is simply a desperate figment of imagination in order to discredit Srila Prabhupada's July 9 order, and it is nothing but a feeble attempt to give credence to the unauthorized guru system in ISKCON. In reality, the July 9 directive alone stands as the sole, unrivaled authorization of the system of Rithvik initiations in ISKCON. Hare Krishna!

**Key Quote:** "Now, the whole human civilization has become so greedy for sense gratification that all the laws of material nature are discarded."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vedic civilization's focus on spiritual advancement with the current civilization's exploitation of nature for sense gratification, leading to negative consequences.

Even though big, big cities were there in the estuaries in the Vedic times, still the whole city would be very beautiful and very pleasing to walk around. The breeze, the plants, the fruits, the trees, everything would be very pleasing. Actually, human society is supposed to live in this manner, in harmony with material nature. And in the Vedic times, the consciousness of the civilization was how to utilize this human form of life, advance in spiritual life. Whereas in the current day world, the whole consciousness of the civilization is how to exploit material nature and maximize my sense gratification. If we live according to the laws of material nature, there is ample opportunity for sense gratification, but not for unlimited, unrestricted sense enjoyment. In a limited, restricted way, in the manner it is mentioned in the Vedas, sense enjoyment is there, not that it is not there. But then, as it is said, the earth produces enough to satisfy the needs of a man, but not the greed of a man. Now, the whole human civilization has become so greedy for sense gratification that all the laws of material nature are discarded, and we try to exploit and exploit and exploit material nature. Because of what happens? Material nature also starts reacting.

**Key Quote:** "This is the love of Krishna."
**Summary:** Krishna demonstrates his love for Vidura by accepting and eating a banana peel offered with devotion, contrasting it with Duryodhana's opulent but less sincere offerings.

When Krishna came to Hastinapura, he did not go to Duryodhana's palace. Instead, he went to Vidura's house. And what did Vidura offer him? Vidura made him sit in one place. Then he brought some bananas. He did not bring any dry fruits. He did not bring badam and walnut and all. He just brought some simple bananas. He peeled the bananas, threw away the banana fruit, and gave the banana skin to Krishna. And what did Krishna do? Vidura is offering me this with so much love and affection. Because Vidura was absorbed in looking at Krishna, he forgot which is fruit, which is skin. And unknowingly, he gave the peel to Krishna. Krishna took that banana peel and ate it. Look at Krishna's love and affection. Can you or I do it? If somebody whom we love, suppose somebody has a girlfriend, loves her very much. He goes to her house. She takes a banana peel and gives it. Will you eat? But look at Krishna. He is thinking, you know, he is offering me with so much love. How can I refuse? Let me eat it. And Krishna is eating. Krishna refused the luxuries of the palace, went to the simple household of Vidura. Krishna refused the big feast that Duryodhana had kept. He took the banana peel from Vidura's hands.

So the brahmana came to the Dwaraka Palace and he condemned all the yadu Dynasty Kings, saying that in the presence of the father, how is the son dying? Because in the olden times, the king used to be responsible to ensure that there were no untimely deaths within the kingdom. People could die only of old age, out of natural causes. If any of the citizen dies in his youth when his father is still living, that means the king has become adharmic, so then the king is no longer fit to rule. So the brahmana came here and accused all the yadu Kings in front of Krishna, Balaram, Ugrasena. He told, he condemned, he criticized all of them, "What is this?

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the story of Dronacharya's Gurudakshina, where he asks the Kauravas and Pandavas to capture King Drupada, highlighting the enmity between Dronacharya and Drupada and the subsequent attack on Panchala.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to this episode of the Mahabharata. We have seen in the last episode how the Pandavas and Kauravas were growing up together in Hastinapura and the enmity which had started manifesting itself between the Kauravas and the Pandava brothers. When the Pandavas and the Kauravas were growing up under the tutelage of Dronacharya, when they had sufficiently grown up, Dronacharya asked the Pandavas and the Kauravas for a Gurudakshina. What was the Gurudakshina that he asked for? Before Dronacharya came to the Kaurava family to teach the children the art of warfare, he had a running feud with the king of Panchala Desha. He had a running feud with the king of Panchala Desha. Who was King Drippada. The eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh comprising Bareilly, Farukabad, Badayu, Kanyakubja or Kannowaj as it is known today, all these areas formed what is known as Panchala. And the capital of Panchala was Kampilya. This Kampilya is today in the place known as Kayamganj near Farooqabad. It is a small town. And even today it is known by the name Kampilya. Because of this running feud, Dronacharya as Guru Dakshina, he told the Kauravas and the Pandavas, "Please go and capture Drupada and bring him to me alive. I have a running enmity with him and I want him to be brought before me, captured. And this is the revenge I want to take against him." The Kaurava brothers went and attacked Panchaladesha. But Drupada was no ordinary king. He was also quite powerful. And he managed to repulse the attack by the Kaurava brothers, headed by Duryodhana. Now, when the Kaurava brothers came back defeated, Arjuna alone went and attacked Panchaladesha, and he defeated Drupada and brought him bound alive in front of Dronacharya.

**Key Quote:** "For a Kshatriya, the greatest humiliation is to be defeated in a battle and captured alive."
**Summary:** The lecture continues with Drupada's humiliation after being captured and released by Dronacharya, leading him to perform a Yajna to beget a son (Drishtadyumna) who would kill Dronacharya, and the birth of Draupadi.

When Arjuna attacked Panchala, he attacked a fort called Ahichatra in Panchala where Drupada was currently residing at that time. This Ahichatra is near Ramnagar in Bareilly of Uttar Pradesh. And even today, some of the remains of that fort are still seen. Then Dronacharya, when Drupada was brought before him, he spoke to Drupada and told him, "See, you had humiliated me and now you are in front of me bound like an animal. And you are at my mercy. But I am a very liberal brahmana, so I don't want to kill you. I just wanted to teach you a lesson not to humiliate other people." And he released Drupada. Drupada went back to Panchala. But then he was very much affected by the humiliation he had undergone. For a Kshatriya, the greatest humiliation is to be defeated in a battle and captured alive. For a Kshatriya, the greatest humiliation is to be defeated in a battle and captured alive and then released is a great ignominy. Drupada could not tolerate this and therefore he conducted a Yajna to beget a son who would have the ability and the power to kill Dronacharya because Drupada knew he himself was not powerful enough to fight with Dronacharya and defeat him and therefore he conducted a Yajna specifically to beget a son who would be powerful enough to kill Dronacharya and out of this Yajna were born a daughter and a son. The son was Drishtadyumna and the daughter was Draupadi. And when Draupadi emerged out of that fire sacrifice, there was a divine proclamation that this girl will in the future become the cause of destruction of many adharmic kings. And this Drishtadyumna was born with the power to be able to in the future kill Dronacharya.

**Key Quote:** "One who is able to distinguish spirit from matter is called a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Drupada sent Drishtadyumna to Dronacharya to learn warfare, even though Drishtadyumna was destined to kill him, and then explains the qualities of a Brahmana, emphasizing the understanding of the difference between the body and the soul, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

This Yajna which Drupada conducted in Kampilya is even today, if you go to the place called Kampilya near Farookabad, there is a pond which has been built there at the spot where this fire sacrifice was conducted. There is also a beautiful temple of Vishnu close by and this town of Kampilya is even today there in Uttar Pradesh. Now, when Drishtadyumna was growing up, Drupada thought, "I am going to kill Dronacharya. He has to send him for education under some suitable teacher who can teach him the art of warfare." And when he contemplated upon this, he realized that no one on the earth at that point of time was as capable as Dronacharya in teaching the art of warfare. And so therefore, he sent Drishtadyumna to Dronacharya to get taught in the battle of, in the art of warfare. Drishtadyumna came to Dronacharya and he approached Dronacharya submissively bowed down before him and naturally because he was a junior person, he first introduced himself to Dronacharya. Drishtadyumna introduced himself saying that "I am Drishtadyumna, the son of Drupada, born to kill you and I have come here seeking to learn the art of warfare from you." Imagine. Imagine somebody comes to you and tells you that I want to learn something from you so that I can use it to kill you. What will your response be? You will either kick him out or you will think how should I finish him now, somehow this man has come to my place, so good opportunity, let me capture him and finish him off so that he will not harm me anyway in the future. That's the natural response a person will have. But then Dronacharya was no ordinary person. He was a great Brahmana, qualified Brahmana. Not just by birth was a Brahmana but even by his qualities he was a Brahmana. The definition of the word Brahmana is brahman janatiti brahmanah. One who is able to distinguish spirit from matter is called a Brahmana. In other words, we have to understand that we are not the body, we are a spirit soul. As Lord Krishna himself says in the Bhagavad Gita, Dehino smin yatha dehe kaumaram yavanam jara, tatha dehan tara praptit dheera statra namuhyati.

**Key Quote:** "Although the bodies are changing, I am still constant. That means I am different from all these bodies."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the concept of a Brahmana and how Dronacharya, being a qualified Brahmana, understood his duty to impart knowledge to a qualified disciple like Drishtadyumna, despite knowing the consequences.

An intelligent person according to Krishna is able to discriminate that I was born as a small baby, I grew up into a young boy, then I become a young man and finally I will become old and I will die one day. So even within this lifetime, I have changed so many bodies. I had the body of a small baby, then that of a young boy or a girl, then that of a young man or a young girl. I may be a young person today. In the future I will become old. I may be a young person today. So within this lifetime, I am changing so many bodies. Although the bodies are changing, I am still constant. That means I am different from all these bodies. A person who is able to distinguish himself, differentiate himself from the material body which can undergo destruction and who understands by this logic that in this life if I can change so many bodies and continue to exist, that means at the time of death, the body which I currently have at that point of time will get destroyed. That means at the time of death, the body which I currently have at that point of time will get destroyed but I will continue to exist in some other body. A person who is able to understand this is called a brahmana. Now Dronacharya was a qualified brahmana. He very well knew that he was not the body. He was an atma. He was a spirit soul. Therefore when Drishtadyumna came in front of him with this kind of request, Dronacharya thought that what is my duty? My duty as a teacher is to teach the knowledge that I have. I have to teach the knowledge that I have to any qualified person who comes and seeks it of me. And this person Drishtadyumna is a qualified person. The knowledge which I will give to him, he will not misuse. He will not harm others with it. He will use it to protect the citizens. I can see that. And assessing that Drishtadyumna was a qualified disciple, Dronacharya accepted him under his tutelage. And he started teaching him the art of warfare along with the Pandavas and the Kauravas. He did not discriminate against him. This shows the great liberal mind of Dronacharya.

**Key Quote:** "Dronacharya went by merit and he went by what was the most appropriate thing, what duty called upon him to do."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Dronacharya's liberal-mindedness by pointing out that he chose Arjuna as the greatest archer over his own son, Ashwathama, and that he taught Drishtadyumna, focusing on merit and duty rather than personal considerations.

In fact two things are very indicative of the liberal mindedness of Dronacharya. Although Dronacharya had a son Ashwathama, he chose to make Arjuna the greatest archer in the world. He taught Arjuna which he did not teach Ashwathama. Why? Because Dronacharya went by merit. He saw that Arjuna had a certain dedication and a certain talent which Ashwathama his own son did not possess. As a beautiful father he taught Ashwathama whatever he had to teach and he gave him a little more facility at certain times also. He was a little more lenient because after all he was his son. And nobody should criticize him saying that as a father he did not do anything for his son. Therefore he was a little more lenient with his son. But still when it came to certain very critical and advanced things Dronacharya gave that those kind of advanced knowledge to Arjuna which he did not give even to Ashwathama. This shows how Dronacharya was never partial. He went by merit and he went by what was the most appropriate thing, what duty called upon him to do. The second thing was the case of Drishtadyumna where Dronacharya considered that my duty is to teach Drishtadyumna. The result is I will get killed. Now I can refuse to teach him but still one day or the other this body has to get destroyed. I have to die one day or the other. One day or the other I have to leave this body and take on another body. So if I don't do my duty also I have to give up this body and if I do my duty also I have to give up this body. It is better that I do my duty and give up this body rather than to live with the ignominy that look at Dronacharya, he did not do his duty and to live with that ignominy is worse than death. It is better that I do my duty and lose my life in the process of doing my duty. And so saying Dronacharya very liberally he taught Drishtadyumna also. And during this time it so happened that having heard about the fame of Drishtadyumna, he came to Dronacharya and requested him to teach him the art of archery. But Dronacharya saw that Ekalavya would misuse the knowledge if it was given to him. And therefore Dronacharya refused to teach Ekalavya. This is generally a misunderstood phenomenon because people think that Dronacharya refused to teach Ekalavya. Ekalavya simply based on the caste in which he was born, which is not true. Because if Dronacharya had such considerations based on the body, he would never have taught Drishtadyumna, the art of warfare. Dronacharya was far far above all these things.

**Key Quote:** "The consideration of Dronacharya was whether this knowledge will be used properly or not."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the common misconception about Dronacharya refusing to teach Ekalavya based on caste, clarifying that Dronacharya's decision was based on his assessment that Ekalavya would misuse the knowledge, illustrated by the incident with the dog.

The consideration of Dronacharya was whether this knowledge will be used properly or not. And Dronacharya's assessment proved true because later once when the Pandavas were going around in the forest, they came upon a dog whose mouth was filled with arrows. And when they saw this, they thought who has done this? And they came upon Ekalavya. And Ekalavya, he informed the Pandavas that this dog was barking. So to quieten it, I shot all these arrows into the mouth of the dog. And the Pandavas saw that Ekalavya had a bust of Dronacharya and he was learning the art of archery, still keeping Dronacharya as his guru. The Pandavas went and informed Dronacharya. Dronacharya came there and he saw what Ekalavya was doing. And he told Ekalavya that "Ekalavya I told you that I am not going to teach you the art of warfare. So why are you keeping my bust and still considering me as a guru and learning the art of archery?" This very fact showed that Ekalavya was disobedient to his guru. When Dronacharya had refused to teach him, if he had gone to some other teacher and learnt the art of warfare, it would have been different. But he refused to listen to Dronacharya. Still he kept Dronacharya as his guru and learnt. Moreover, what we can see is that Dronacharya's assessment of his future potential of Ekalavya misusing the art of warfare was seen in his silencing the dog by shooting arrows into its mouth. How to understand this? The simple question. The simple example is like for example there is an NSD commando. In the army the NSD commando are the elite commando forces and they are taught all kinds of how to use all kinds of automatic weapons. Now let us say an NSD commando, he is proficient in using the latest assault rifle, an automatic rifle and he has come home and he is relaxing. And the neighbor's dog starts barking and it disturbs him a lot. So what he does? He comes out of his house, brings his automatic rifle and pumps hundreds of bullets into the dog. What will be the result of this? The army will strip him of his NSD commandoship. They will remove him, they will suspend him from his job and they will take away the assault rifle. They will say, this assault rifle is not meant for shooting at dogs, it is meant for use in a circumstance where is there is danger to the life of the dog. But why do you do this attack the citizens?

**Key Quote:** "This assault rifle is not meant for shooting at dogs, it is meant for use in a circumstance where is there is danger to the life of the dog."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of an NSD commando misusing an assault rifle to explain Ekalavya's misuse of archery, emphasizing that Dronacharya took away Ekalavya's thumb to prevent further misuse of knowledge, not out of partiality or caste discrimination.

If the dog was disturbing you, all that you have to do was stick up a stone and throw it at it, no, you do not have to throw a stone at a dog. Even if you make a, even if you feign, as if you are going to throw a stone at the dog, the dog will quieten down or it will run away. This is natural. All of us would have experienced this at some time or the other. So similarly, when he, when Ekalavya came across a dog barking at him, all that he had to do was take a stone and throw at it. But what did he do? He decided to use that great art of archery against the dog. That poor dog became the object for Ekalavya to show off his art of archery which is not acceptable because the art of archery is a very very high level of knowledge to be utilized only for protection of people, not to harm people, whether any person, whether it is a human being or an animal. In Vedic times both human beings as well as animals were considered praja or the citizens of the country. Animals also had an equal right to be protected by the government unlike today's time. Today's time animals are sent to the slaughterhouses and all protection is given to the human beings. Vedic times was not like that. Even animals were protected by the government. Even animals were given the right of protection. So this Ekalavya did not display that sense of protecting subordinate people or junior people. A dog is a very subordinate animal. It was worthy of his protection but instead he was shooting arrows into his mouth. And he did not even consider now that all the arrows are stuck in the mouth of the dog, the poor dog how will it survive? What will it eat? So you can see from this Ekalavya was prone to misuse of the knowledge of warfare. And seeing this therefore Dronacharya did not want him to commit further crimes like this. And therefore Dronacharya told him okay you are considering me as a guru, you give me your thumb as guru Dakshina. And he took away his thumb so that the chances of his misusing the knowledge of archery would be reduced. Another thing Dronacharya could have easily done was to kill him. But Dronacharya was not so keen to kill somebody. He thought why I have to kill someone. Let me just take away his thumb. That is enough to prevent him from misusing the knowledge he has. And this was the reason for Dronacharya to do this.

**Key Quote:** "We can see in the character of Dronacharya there was no question of partiality and he never made decisions based on the consideration of the body."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Dronacharya's actions were not based on partiality or bodily considerations, and then transitions to discussing the growing enmity between the Pandavas and Kauravas, fueled by Karna and Shakuni.

Unlike the mispropaganda that is spread everywhere today that Dronacharya on the basis of caste, he decided to stop the Dronacharya. To stop the Ekalavya from becoming a good archer. Or another misconception is that Dronacharya was partial to Arjuna and therefore he did not want Ekalavya to become the topmost archer, which is not true. We can see in the character of Dronacharya there was no question of partiality and he never made decisions based on the consideration of the body. This we have seen earlier itself from the example of Drishtadyumna and Ashwathama. So now, the Pandavas, so this showed the great characteristic and quality of Dronacharya. Now, when the Pandavas and the Kauravas, they had sufficiently grown up, we have also seen how there was some amount of enmity between the Kauravas and the Pandavas. Because Karna was also almost equal to Arjuna, but Arjuna was still better than Karna in many aspects of archery. Karna also did not get along well with the Pandavas. And as we know, foe's foe is a friend. Duryodhana struck up a friendship with Karna and Karna became a steadfast friend of Duryodhana. And Duryodhana, he was being guided by Gandhari's brother Shakuni, who was not a person of good character. He was a cunning person. And he was always his, Shakuni's eyes were always on the throne, that somehow or the other, my nephew should get the throne. And Karna was also not a man of good character. And so these two people started counselling Duryodhana. And thus, they both started feeding, already Duryodhana was burning with envy towards the Pandavas. Now, these two personalities started feeding that fire of envy in Duryodhana's heart. And so Duryodhana's heart started burning. And so Duryodhana's heart turned to a fire of pan-d survives itself becoming more and more envious and inimical towards the Pandavas. Now, Duryodhana, he realized that direct confrontation with the Pandavas would not yield any result because he had seen how, against even Drupada, he had been defeated but Arjuna had single handedly defeated Drupada. This itself showed the prowess of Arjuna. Arjuna, one brother, was enough to defeat the entire Kauravas. So, this is in the same way that Duryodhana was feeling. Now they were five brothers. Look at the strength of Bhima and then there was Yudhishthira, Nakula, Sahadeva. They were also not any less warriors. Therefore Duryodhana understood that direct confrontation would not work out.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Duryodhana's plan, hatched with Shakuni, to eliminate the Pandavas by sending them to a house of shellac in Varanavata and setting it ablaze, ending with a cliffhanger to be continued in the next episode.

And so based on the advice of Shakuni, Duryodhana hatched a plan to eliminate the Pandavas. Duryodhana had a house built of shellac in a place called Varanavata. This Varanavata is in current day Haryana and today it is known as Barnava. Even today if you go to this place Barnava, the place where the house of shellac stood, the palace of shellac stood is a big mound of earth. And this is the place where the house of shellac was built by Duryodhana with a worker named Purochana. The intention of Duryodhana was that shellac is a very inflammable material. He would on some pretext send the Pandavas to stay in this house of shellac in Varanavata and his idea was to set it ablaze. And the Pandavas would die in the inferno and he could announce to the world that the Pandavas have died in a fire accident. That was the plan he hatched with Shakuni and Dhritarashtra. And with this intention he created this house of shellac and Dhritarashtra also called the Pandavas and he told them that Duryodhana has built a nice palace for all of you. So for a few days you please go there and have some leisure time, relax there and come back after a few days. Like this Dhritarashtra told the Pandavas. The Pandavas were unaware of the plotting by Duryodhana and so they thought uncle is telling us to go so let us all go. And so they along with the Pandavas along with Kunti Devi set out to go to Varanavata. Now, what happened to the Pandavas when they went to Varanavata? Could they escape from the house of Shellac? How did they, how could they escape when they had no knowledge of what was going to happen? Join us in our next session of Mahabharata to learn about this. Thank you for joining us today.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, focusing on the plot devised by Duryodhana and his allies to cheat the Pandavas out of their kingdom during the game of dice.

And welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the previous episode, we have seen the beginning of one of the key moments in the history of the world, in the history of the Mahabharata, a pivotal point in the whole narration of the Mahabharata epic, the game of dice. We saw how Duryodhana and Shakuni, Duryodhana, Shakuni, Karna, and Dhritarashtra, Dushyasana, all these people combined together to lay out a scheme, a plot, how to trap the Pandavas and take their kingdom by cheating, because the Pandavas were too powerful for direct confrontation. We also saw how Yudhishthiram had a great power over the Mahabharata. He was hard excited and eager to turn that game around. He almost stepped out when Dhritarashtra killed him. Udhishthira Maharaj was unwilling to participate in that game of dice, but he was bound by the instructions of his elder, Dhritarashtra. Even though Yudhishthira tried to wriggle out of the trap set by Duryodhana and Shakuni by refusing to play with Shakuni, Duryodhana, on the plea of playing himself, made Shakuni catch the dice on his behalf.

This distances between the two power- environments, which was actually not according to the rules of the game, but Dhritarashtra, as the referee, he did not object to it and he did not give heed to Yudhishthira's objection. So Yudhishthira was forced to go along. When the dice started rolling, the stakes initially started with small things, some jewels, some gold, etc. Each time the dice would be rolled, Sakuni would win and Yudhishthira would lose. Gradually, as the play progressed, the stakes became bigger, armies, the different kinds of weapons, servants, different soldiers, etc., etc. The stakes kept getting bigger and bigger and each

And Yudhishthira, having no other go, he put his kingdom at stake and played, and Yudhishthira lost that also. Now the whole assembly was abuzz. While all this was going on, the people who are witnessing were not very happy with the way things were proceeding. They could see that the whole game was rigged, but then Dhritarashtra, the emperor, was sitting there and he was not saying anything, and the king's word is final, so people did not know what to do.

So Dhritarashtra was waiting because he was, his greed was not allowing him to heed the words of Vidura, although he knew that Vidura meant well and whatever Vidura spoke were actually very full of wisdom.

inside. If a person keeps losing, he will think, keep thinking, maybe just one step next, next time I may be able to win back everything. So Yudhishthira also thought, now what to do? The kingdom is lost, everything is lost, they are back on the streets, the Pandavas are back on the street. So he put at stake Nakula and he lost Nakula also. Then Sahadeva, Sahadeva also lost. Then he staked Arjuna and he lost Arjuna also. Finally, he staked Bhima, very unwillingly, but with no other choice, he staked Bhima and Bhima was also lost. Now the whole assembly fell completely silent because what was happening, because everyone could see what was happening was not at all auspicious. This was going to lead to something terrible. Everybody could sense it. Then finally Yudhishthira Maharaj, seeing no other go, he stated himself and he played one last attempt, let me try one last time, maybe I will be able to win back everything. And he staked himself and the dice was rolled and again Yudhishthira Maharaj was lost. Now he was perspiring, he did not know what to do. Everything had been lost according to the scheme, according to the trap laid by Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra, Shakuni and others.

**Key Quote:** "Shakuni told him you still have one chance what is that one chance why don't you stake Draupadi she is still there that's the last thing you possess"
**Summary:** Shakuni suggests staking Draupadi, causing an uproar in the assembly. Yudhishthira stakes and loses her, leading to widespread shock and condemnation, except from Duryodhana and his allies.

Now what to do? He was completely downcast. Then Shakuni told him, you still have one chance. What is that one chance? Why don't you stake Draupadi? She is still there. That's the last thing you possess. The whole assembly was an uproar. How can Draupadi be staked? How can she, is the daughter-in-law of the Kaurava household? How can her honor be put at stake? And now Vidura could not tolerate it. He spoke very heavily against Duryodhana and told Dhritarashtra, please stop this. Don't do this. Now, what happens is when Duryodhana heard this, Duryodhana could not broke it, whatever Vidura was saying, and he started chastising him very severely, reprimanding him very severely, because it is said that, if advice is given to a foolish person for his own welfare, instead of shanta, instead of it making him peaceful, it will only anger him. An intelligent person, when he receives the advice of a foolish person, he will only anger him. When he receives good advice, he will take it very peacefully and he will dwell on it, he will contemplate on it and try to make use of that advice. But a foolish person will think, this advice is for my detrimental, it is detrimental to my interest. And when good advice is given, he will not accept it. Duryodhana was like that. Despite Vidura's so many good advice, he would never accept it. He always was under the impression that Vidura, he is, is partial towards the Pandavas and he does not think of my welfare, although in reality Vidura was talking for his own good. Duryodhana very severely reprimanded Vidura and Dhritarashtra was silent. He did not take any action. So Vidura also felt silent because he also became helpless. And so now Draupadi was put at stake. And again the dice was rolled. And like all the previous times, again Yudhishthira Maharaj lost. Now everything was gone. Nothing was left. The whole assembly

**Key Quote:** "Karna started remembering the insult that Draupadi had made upon him in the Swayambhara where in front of everyone she had said that Karna, because of being born in a Sudra family, he could not participate in the Swayambhara."
**Summary:** Karna, fueled by past resentment, instigates the humiliation of Draupadi, declaring her a slave and ordering her to be brought to the servant's quarters, recalling her rejection of him at her Swayamvara.

was completely in uproar. Nobody was happy with what was happening, except for three, four people: Dushyasana, Karna, Duryodhana, Shakuni, Dhritarashtra. These were the only people who were really happy. Nobody else was happy. Now Karna started remembering the insult that Draupadi had made upon him in the Swayambhara, where in front of everyone she had said that Karna, because of being born in a Sudra family, he could not participate in the Swayambhara. So he immediately told Duryodhana, now Draupadi is a slave. The Pandavas have lost themselves. All the Yudhishthira and Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, all the Pandavas have lost themselves. Now Duryodhana, Karna, Duryodhana, Shakuni, Dhritarashtra, Karna, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, all the Pandavas have lost themselves. They are all our slaves. And even Draupadi has been lost in the game of dice. So bring her, why she should stay in the royal household. Please bring her and let us send her to the quarters, the servant's quarters. Let her stay with all the maidservants. So our servant was sent to bring Draupadi from her inner chambers. Now Draupadi had not dressed herself yet. Generally when we, we are at home, we will be wearing some casual dress, we will not be wearing our formal dress. So Draupadi was in her casual dress, she was not planning to come out, so she was not dressed formally. So she was not in a position to come to the assembly when called for and when she heard from the messenger that like this, in the game of dice, Yudhishthira Maharaj had lost all the brothers. He had lost himself and he had lost Draupadi also and now Draupadi was told to come to the assembly so that she could be sent to the servant's quarters.

**Summary:** Draupadi questions the fairness of her being staked, and Dushyasana forcibly drags her, improperly dressed, into the assembly, disregarding her pleas and the presence of elders.

She sent the messenger back with a question asking whether she had been fairly lost in the bet, whether she had been fairly lost in the game of dice. Did Yudhishthira stake her and lose her and then he lost himself or he first staked himself and then he lost himself. He staked Draupadi later in which case the whole, his losing Draupadi becomes questionable. Now when the messenger came back and asked this question, nobody had a proper answer. So Duryodhana told Dushyasana, what is all this, you know, asking various people to bring her, you go and bring her. So Dushyasana forcibly entered into the women's quarters. Actually men are not supposed to enter the women's quarters. Enter into the women's section of the palace wherever they are staying. The men's and the women's quarters would be completely different. But he forcibly entered there, caught hold of Draupadi by her hair, by her tresses and he started dragging her to the assembly. Draupadi was, she was objecting, she was saying, I am not dressed properly, I can't come in this state. There are so many elderly people like Bhishma, Drona, Dhritarashtra, all such personalities, all such personalities. They are there. How can I come like this? But he would not listen. He just dragged her forcibly into the assembly and pulled her on the floor of the assembly.

**Summary:** The elders are horrified, but remain silent. Duryodhana and Karna continue to taunt Draupadi, declaring her a slave and suggesting she choose a new husband.

And when Bhishma saw this, when Drona saw this, when Vidura saw this, they were beside themselves with tears. Actually it was not an insult of Draupadi, it was an insult of the entire Kaurava dynasty. Duryodhana did not understand this. Dhritarashtra was not willing to listen. He was not willing to go against Duryodhana. Now who is going to stop them? Vidura is trying his best. Dhritarashtra would not listen to Vidura, nor would he listen to Bhishma, nor would he listen to Drona. He would not listen to anyone except Duryodhana. So, everybody, nobody knew what to do. Everybody was beside themselves and the assembly, big furor in the assembly. How can Draupadi be brought here? So many people were objecting. Some people were speaking in favor of Duryodhana. Some people were objecting. And when she was brought like this, then Duryodhana started telling her, now your husbands have lost you. Now you are a slave. You please go to the servants quarters and be with the maid servants. And then Karna told her, told Draupadi, Draupadi, now all your husbands, they have all lost you. They have all become our slaves. Now you pick up somebody else as your husband. These people are no more your slaves. And these people are no more your husbands.

**Summary:** Draupadi pleads for justice, questioning the validity of her being staked after Yudhishthira lost himself. Bhishma admits his confusion, unable to provide a clear answer.

Like this, such piercing words were being used. Draupadi was weeping and she was inconsolable. And she looked at Drona, she looked at Bhishma, Vidura, none of them are saying anything. Then she started talking to Dhritarashtra, oh my king, what is this? The honor of the entire Kaurava dynasty is being brought to the, in front of all the public like this? Is this the way to treat Dhritarashtra? Is this the way to treat the women folk of the Kaurava dynasty? Dhritarashtra was silent. Then she asked Dhritarashtra, please tell me, if Yudhishthira Maharaj had lost himself before staking me, then how is it right for him to stake me further and then lose me? Because he has already lost himself. He is no more in a position to stake anybody else. Now she asked Bhishma. Bhishma said, my dear daughter, I am unable to answer you because although Yudhishthira lost himself first and in one sense what you are saying is right, at the same time, no matter in what situation a man is, his wife is still his own. Just because Yudhishthira lost himself in the bed doesn't mean that he lost you also. Even after he became the slave of the Kauravas, of Duryodhana and others, he is still your husband. And so he had the right to stake you. So this is also there. At the same time, this logic is also there that Yudhishthira, having staked himself, had no more right to continue playing. So I am confused. I am not able to give a proper answer.

**Key Quote:** "At that time, one of Duryodhana's brothers, Vikarna, he stood up and he objected. He said, Draupadi, her honor is being put on the floor like this. I am not for this."
**Summary:** Vikarna objects to the treatment of Draupadi, arguing that she was unfairly staked. Karna rebukes Vikarna and suggests that Draupadi be disrobed, questioning her honor for having five husbands.

And so now there was nobody was able to say anything. At that time, one of Duryodhana's brothers, Vikarna, he stood up and he objected. He said, Draupadi, her honor is being put on the floor like this. I am not for this. He objected very strongly. And he said, according to me, Yudhishthira Maharaj, the one, the moment he had lost himself in the game of dice, the game of dice was over. There was no more question of betting and there was no more question of further staking Draupadi. So Draupadi is not lost. She cannot be brought into the ashram. She cannot be made a maid servant. I oppose this. Vikarna spoke very strongly, although he was a younger brother of Duryodhana. And when Karna saw this, he flared up and he started rebuking Vikarna like anything. And then Karna did something unthinkable. Karna told Dushyasana, Dushyasana, what is this Draupadi is going on talking so many things and she is asking for justice and all that. After all, she is a woman who has married five men. She has married five men as husband. Does any respectable woman do that? I think what you should do is disrobe her. Let her become naked. What she is talking so much about her honor and all that. Like this, Karna incited Dushyasana and Dushyasana also. He was also a wild man. Immediately, he was also waiting for an opportunity. Immediately, he caught hold of Draupadi's sari and started pulling at it.

**Key Quote:** "Immediately, he caught hold of Draupadi's sari and started pulling at it."
**Summary:** Dushyasana begins to disrobe Draupadi. Bhima is filled with fury but restrained by Yudhishthira's adherence to dharma. Draupadi, seeing no help from her husbands or the assembly, remembers Lord Krishna.

Now Bhima, he was waiting. He was beside himself with fury. He could not control himself. But then what to do? He was bound by his elder brother's words. And his elder brother, because he is so much fixed in virtuosity and dharma that he is not going to go against his word. He had already given his word. He had lost himself and his brothers. So he was not in a position to say anything against what Duryodhana and others were saying because they were now their slaves. So Yudhishthira Maharaj could not say anything. He could not do anything. And Bhima was bound by his words. And Arjuna started pacifying Bhima. Calm down. Calm down. Don't become too angry now. Now is not the right time. Our hands are tied. So like this, Arjuna was constantly pacifying Bhima. And so now, the brothers were not able to do anything. And in the whole assembly, Dushyasana started trying to pacify Bhima. She started trying to strip Draupadi by pulling at her saree. And Draupadi, she is trying to protect herself. She is trying to protect her honor. She is holding on with great effort to her, with great strength to her saree. But this man, Dushyasana is such a well-built, powerful guy. And Draupadi is such a delicate woman. She is a delicate princess. What she will fight against this, this bulky, hefty man full of muscles and full of strength. So she tried her best to hold the saree but she was not able to. And she saw that her husbands are not in a position to help her. She saw that the entire assembly, nobody is speaking against this injustice. So what to do now? Then she remembered one person who is the refuge of all people who are completely shelterless.

**Summary:** Draupadi, realizing her helplessness, surrenders completely to Lord Krishna, who is present within her heart as Paramatma, remembering his promise to protect her.

That is the Supreme Personality of God and Lord Krishna. So she started calling out to Krishna. Krishna! Krishna! She started calling out. But then this Dushyasana is not giving up. She is holding on. She is calling out to Krishna but nothing is happening. Then finally she realized, I am holding on to this saree with all my effort, but ultimately I cannot protect myself. In this assembly when such big, big people are there, my husbands are such great heroes, such great warriors, they are not able to protect me. What? I will protect myself. My only shelter is Lord Krishna. So she let go of her saree. She raised her hands and started calling out, O Govinda! O Gopijanavallada! O Hari Murari! Like that she started calling out to Krishna. The moment she started calling out to Krishna, Krishna, although you are so far away in Dwaraka, but then Krishna, as he says in the Bhagavad Gita, Sarvasya Chaham Hrithi Sannivishtaha, Krishna is seated in every living entity's heart as Paramatma. So the moment she gave up everything else, her dependence on her husbands, her dependence on her own abilities, she gave up everything and totally surrendered to Krishna. Krishna as Paramatma immediately sensed that surrender and although Krishna was not there, Krishna was seated in Dwaraka. He knew everything of what was happening. And then he remembered his promise to Draupadi for the service that she had rendered to him.

**Summary:** Dushyasana's attempts to disrobe Draupadi are miraculously thwarted as her sari becomes endless, leading to his exhaustion and the assembly's recognition of Krishna's intervention.

And Krishna decided now is the time to repay the debt to Draupadi. And so what happened? After that, Dushyasana pulled and pulled and pulled at her saree. The saree just kept coming and coming and the yards and the yards of cloth is being piled up on the floor. The cloth is piling on. Minute after minute, hour after hour he is pulling. Only the cloth is piling up but Draupadi is not getting disrobed. And pulling, pulling, pulling, finally what happened? Dushyasana lost all his strength and his stamina came to an end and he sat down on the floor perspiring in the midst of all the cloth. He was not able to understand what is happening, from where all this cloth is coming. And the whole assembly erupted in an uproar when they saw this wonderful miracle that was happening. Everybody understood how Krishna had saved the honour of Draupadi. So now the Vidura and Bhishma, they were all, they understood that somehow by Krishna's mercy this has happened and now Krishna is not going to keep quiet. So they became even more alarmed and they started advising Dhritarashtra at least now please stop all these injustices that's happening. How can the Kaurava assembly be sullied by trying to outrage the modesty of a woman? That too not an ordinary woman. She is one of the women folk of our own dynasty. How can this happen? How can you allow this to happen?

**Summary:** Bhima, enraged by Dushyasana's actions, vows to tear open his chest and drink his blood. Duryodhana mocks Draupadi, further fueling Bhima's anger.

Their fervent pleas were falling on deaf ears. Dhritarashtra had not only become blind, he had become deaf also. Now when Dushyasana failed in disrobing Draupadi and when Duryodhana saw all this and the Pandavas were so angry, Bhima, now he was not able to check his anger and Bhima when he saw how Dushyasana had tried to outrage the modesty of Draupadi, he looked at Dushyasana and he took a vow, a terrible vow, a vow which swore a vow so terrible, nobody had heard of such a vow before. He said in a raised voice, his eyes red with fury, Bhima said, listen everyone, I take a vow before everyone. In battle, I will tear open the chest of Dushyasana and I will drink his blood. When the assembly heard this, Bhishma, Drona, they were all struck with fear. But Duryodhana, like a fool, like a fly which foolishly it rushes into a blazing fire, oblivious of the fact that the flame is going to consume it, Duryodhana was laughing. And then he exposed this right thigh and slapping his thigh, Duryodhana told Draupadi, come, come, my dear woman, come and sit on my thigh. Now Bhima, already he was curious when he saw this, his rock completely exceeded all limits. Then he said, I am taking one more vow. In battle, I will break that thigh of yours and I will teach you a lesson.

#### Draupadi's disrobing, Yudhisthira's dilemma, Duty vs. Power

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So does that not free the Pandavas from their binding to their words?"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the events of Draupadi's attempted disrobing and questions why Yudhisthira and the Pandavas did not intervene, exploring the conflict between their duty as servants and their duty to protect their wife.

Hare Krishna and welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode, we have seen that very painful incident of the game of dice, where Draupadi was attempted to be stripped naked by the Kauravas, headed by Karna, Duryodhana, Dushyasana, and others. And although Dushyasana tried his best to disrobe Draupadi, Draupadi surrendered herself completely to Lord Krishna, and Krishna in turn protected her modesty. And so, Dushyasana pulled and pulled at her Sari with great anticipation, but that anticipation turned to amazement when he saw an endless supply of her Sari covered cloth, and that amazement turned into frustration, that frustration became despair. Finally, he sat down fatigued, unable to disrobe Draupadi. Now, when the incidents had gone this far, Dhritarashtra had a change of heart. What did Dhritarashtra do? That is what we will be discussing today. Before we come to that, we need to understand a little bit about the whole egregious happenings in that game of dice. We all have understood how Yudhishtira was compelled to participate in the game of dice, not because he was inclined to it, but because it was the order of his superior, Dhritarashtra, whom he considered as good as his father. Now, although Yudhishtira knew that this was a trap laid out to hurt him and his brothers, Yudhishtira could not help it. He was looking towards Dhritarashtra's intervention to correct the injustice that was happening during the game of dice, but Dhritarashtra was silent all through. Now the question comes that when Draupadi was brought into that assembly and when her honor was being sullied by the Kauravas, why did Yudhishtira and the other Pandava brothers not act? Was it not their duty to protect the honour of their wife? Yes, it was their duty to the extent that their powers authorized them to protect her. We all have our limitations. Even though we may be wanting to protect our near and dear ones, there are some things which are beyond our power and we are unable to help them at times. This happens with all of us. Now in the case of the Pandavas, although physically they might have been capable of protecting her, morally they were bound by the word they had given to the Kauravas that they were now their servants. And as servants, it was their duty to do the bidding of their masters. So what use are such masters who do not protect the honour of their servants? So does that not free the Pandavas from their binding to their words?

#### Kshatriya Dharma, Duty of a King, Duryodhana's Adharma
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/nFxsWxV9uTc?t=322

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Now it was Duryodhana's duty as a king to protect the honor of the Pandavas, who are now also his citizens."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Pandavas, having lost their kingdom, were no longer obligated to protect others; instead, it became Duryodhana's duty as king to protect them, including Draupadi, and that Duryodhana failed in his dharma.

So does that not free the Pandavas from their binding to their words? The fact is, that the Pandavas having lost all their kingdom and having been stripped of their Kshatriya position, having become servants of Duryodhana, no more were they in a position to be able to provide protection to others. Protecting others, protecting the citizens is the duty of the Kshatriya. Kshata trayate yati kshatriya. The Kshatriya is the person who protects his citizens from any kind of danger. It is the Kshatriya king's responsibility to give protection to all his citizens. Now that the Pandavas were no longer kings, they were mere servants, they were mere ordinary citizens, under the rule of Duryodhana. Now it was Duryodhana's duty as a king to protect the honor of the Pandavas, who are now also his citizens. Now if Duryodhana is not following his duty, if he is deviating, if he is flagrantly flouting the codes of Dharma, according to which he has to protect the honor of his citizens and prevent any kind of danger, then he is a king. Any harm to them, whether physically or economically or in terms of their honor, if Duryodhana, the king himself is flouting these duties, then what can the citizen do? So the Pandavas, in fact it was the duty of Duryodhana to protect Draupadi. He was not keeping up his duty. It was the duty of Dhritarashtra to ensure that there was no injustice to the Pandavas and even he violated his duty. Now because Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra and Karna and Dushyasana, all these people they flouted their dharma, their duty does not mean that the Pandavas also should forget their duty. Actually this was the biggest difference between Yudhishthira and the other Pandava brothers and Duryodhana.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Duryodhana's willingness to violate dharma to achieve his desires with the Pandavas' commitment to upholding dharma even in the face of great suffering.

On the one hand, Duryodhana was ready to violate every rule of dharma at the drop of a hat. Why? Because his whole consideration was, his whole focus was the end. What I will get? What I want to get? How do I satisfy my desire? The means did not matter to him. He was ready to achieve his desire by hook or by crook. It did not matter to him. It did not matter to him that he was violating the codes of dharma. It did not matter to him that he was violating the rules of the Vedas. It did not matter to him that he was incurring grievous sin because of which he would have to suffer in the future. None of these things mattered to him. For him, all that mattered was, somehow I have to get Indraprastha in my hand. Somehow I have to insult the Pandavas. Somehow I have to insult Draupadi. This was his whole focus. Now if you look at the Pandavas, the Pandavas were reluctant to violate the codes of dharma, words of virtuousness, even in the face of the greatest calamity. Even when Draupadi the wife's honor was put at stake, even there the Pandavas' consideration was, as per the codes of Dharma, what is our duty now? What are the steps that we can take? Or what are the things we should not be doing?

#### Duty and Responsibility, Vishwamitra and Dasaratha, Vedic Social Structure

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is the duty of the king."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the story of Vishwamitra Muni and Dasaratha Maharaj to illustrate the Vedic concept of assigned duties and responsibilities within society, where the king is responsible for protecting those engaged in spiritual activities.

So Uddistira Maharaj, from the Pandava's consideration. If we look at it from there, from that perspective, the duty was resting with Duryodhana and with Dhritarashtra to protect Draupadi's honor because she is also their citizen. They had been deprived of their authority to perform that function of protecting others the moment they were shown of their kingdom and they were converted into ordinary servants. We have examples of this in the Vedic history. Even though a person may be very well capable of defending himself, still in Vedic times the people would consider, is it my duty to defend myself or is it somebody else's duty. When Vishwamitra Muni was performing tapasya's and yajnas in the temple, he was not only in the forest, there was a demoness who was coming and creating trouble for him, not allowing him to carry out his spiritual duty. Vishwamitra Muni is such a powerful sage. Not only that, before Vishwamitra Muni became the sage, he had been a king, a very powerful valiant king. So, it is not that he was unaware of the techniques of combat, how to fight, where to fight, with an asura, with a demoness. It was not unknown to him. Not only that, as a sage, he had powerful mantras by the dint of his austerities with which he could have easily killed the demoness. But he did not do so. He considered, my duty as a sage, what is my duty? My duty is to engage in spiritual activities. Whose duty is it to ensure that my spiritual duty is fulfilled? That is his duty. His duties are carried on without any obstruction. It is the duty of the king. And therefore, Vishwamitra Muni went to Dasaratha Maharaj, who was ruling the kingdom at that time and he informed him, like this, there is this demoness who is creating trouble for me. So, you have to please solve my problem. And Dasaratha Maharaj immediately said, yes, I am ready. I will come myself. You are such a great sage. It is a shame that if I am not able to protect you, I will come myself. And then Vishwamitra Muni said, no, no, you don't have to come. This is not such a big thing. Then Dasaratha Maharaj asked him, then whom should I send? Vishwamitra Muni said, send your two young sons, Sri Ramachandra and Lakshmana with me, who were at that time just teenagers. Dasaratha Maharaj balked. He was daunted. Why? My sons? They are so tender. They are just teenagers. They cannot fight with Asuras. So, Vishwamitra Muni, please, you don't ask for them, I will come myself. Out of parental affection, Dasaratha Maharaj did not recognize the great valor and capability and strength, the unlimited strength of the Supreme Lord Ramachandra.

#### Ramachandra's Valor, Varnasrama Dharma, Duty vs. Occupation

**Key Quote:** "In today's world, unfortunately, that societal structure has completely collapsed of the Varnasthama Dharma."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Vishwamitra and Dasaratha, highlighting Ramachandra's valor, and then laments the collapse of the Varnasrama Dharma in modern society, emphasizing the distinction between one's duty (dharma) and one's occupation (vritti).

For him, Ramachandra and Lakshmana were just his tender sons. Out of parental affection, he did not. He was taken aback by Vishwamitra Muni's suggestion, but Vishwamitra Muni knows everything and he is aware that this is also an idea of Lord Ramachandra and so therefore, he insisted and took Lord Ramachandra with him and he taught Ramachandra all the art of warfare and then Lord Ramachandra used that art in defeating the demoness. So, you see how Vishwamitra Muni, although he knew the art of warfare, he did not engage in the war himself, the demons. He engaged the Kshatriyas, the king of that area, who was responsible, who was interested with that responsibility. This is because during those times, in the Vedic tradition and the Sanatana Dharma, the duties of different persons in the social functioning of the society was very well laid out. In today's world, unfortunately, that societal structure has completely collapsed of the Varnasthama Dharma. Now we do not have an understanding of what is duty at all. We think we mistake our vritti, our occupation to be Dharma, to be Karma, which is not correct. There is a big difference between vritti and Dharma. There is a big difference between occupation for one's livelihood and one's duty. We have duties towards all other rest of the society. We have duties towards our parents, we have duties towards our forefathers, we have duties towards the sages, who have given us transcendental knowledge, we have duties towards devatas, who are supplying us all kinds of natural facilities, such as sunlight and air and water etc. For our livelihood, we have duties towards all other domestic, even to domestic, animals like the cow and the dog etc which render us service. We have responsibilities, we have duties, we have obligations towards our other relatives, it may be my husband, it may be my wife, it may be my sister, my other relatives, my friends, whoever helps me in various activities, I have obligations towards all of them. There are duties prescribed in the Vedas for all this. So duty is completely different from occupation for one's livelihood. One may give up one occupation and take on another occupation, but one cannot give up one's duty. And as Lord Krishna himself says in the Bhagavad-Gita, one must not give up one's duty however imperfectly performed to take up the duty of some other person however perfectly they may be able to do it.

#### Importance of Duty, Dharma vs. Result, Pandavas' Example

**Key Quote:** "One must not give up one's duty however imperfectly performed to take up the duty of some other person however perfectly they may be able to do it"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad-gita to reinforce the importance of adhering to one's own duty, even if imperfectly performed, and contrasts this with Duryodhana's focus solely on the outcome, while the Pandavas prioritized the means (dharma) over the end result.

This is against the laws of the scripture. I may be able to do my duty say with 50% efficiency, but I look at somebody else's assigned duty, I can do that much better, so let me do that. No, even though you are assigned the duty you are able to do imperfectly, it is better than doing some other person's duty which is not assigned to you very perfectly. This is the code of dharma and so the Pandavas always even in that calamitous situation were considering what is virtuosity dictating to me what should I do and what should not I, what should I not do? Is this my duty to protect Draupadi or is it not? It is the duty of actually the emperor, the king, Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were responsible for her protection and if they are not performing their duty does not mean that I should violate my duty, I should give up my duty. This is a very big difference between Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra and the Kauravas when compared with the Pandavas. Duryodhana never had such consideration. He never thought what should I do and what should I not do? Is my activity according to dharma or not? He was simply focused on the result, somehow I have to get the result, the means don't matter, the only the end matters, whereas for the Pandavas the end did not matter, no matter how they were insulted, whether they lost their kingdom, whether they lost the honor of their wife, whatever it was, they would not deviate from the means, the end was immaterial to

#### Yudhisthira's Guidance, Dharma Raja, Draupadi's Faith

**Key Quote:** "Everybody knew in that assembly that Yudhishthira Maharaj was Dharma Raja he would never deviate from the path of dharma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Bhima and Arjuna followed Yudhisthira's lead, emphasizing Yudhisthira's reputation as Dharma Raja and Draupadi's unwavering faith in his adherence to dharma, even amidst her suffering.

Bhima and Arjuna to come to follow Yudhishthira's this one. He has given his word. Why could not Bhima or Arjuna jump in and then protect Draupadi? Was following the instructions of their brother more important than protecting the honor of Draupadi? The fact is that Draupadi is also the wife of Yudhishthira, so there is the responsibility equal. Now as far as the Vedic culture was concerned, the eldest person had the responsibility of guiding the younger people on the path of dharma. The younger people always looked up to the elder people for guidance. So everybody knew in that assembly that Yudhishthira Maharaj was Dharma Raja. He would never deviate from the path of dharma. His brothers also knew that and nobody knew the intricacies of dharma better than Yudhishthira and so therefore the younger brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, and others, even though they could see such a difference between dharma and Yudhishthira, injustice being meted out in that assembly, they held on to their firm faith in their brother Yudhishthira Maharaj that he knows the codes of dharma very well and he will tell us what is the real dharmic duty that they had to perform at that point of time. So even Bhima and Arjuna were also very clear in their mind, we have to do what is our ordained duty. We cannot, we cannot flout the requirements of our duty. We cannot violate the laws of dharma. So therefore the Pandavas are the most, are the most pious people, they are the most praiseworthy people. In fact, when the game of dice ended in this kind of fiasco, even though the Yudhishthira Maharaj lost in that game of dice, even though Draupadi was about to be disrobed, but Lord Krishna had to step in to save her, the fact is even Draupadi had no resentment in her heart towards Yudhishthira Maharaj. She had full confidence that whatever Yudhishthira Maharaj has done was within the codes of dharma. He could clearly understand that even Bhima and Arjuna were bound by the ropes of dharma of virtuosity and so therefore she had no resentment in her heart because she was also inclined and she felt that she was totally inquisitive. She was also equally disposed to follow the course of Dharma rather than look at what was the result that had accrued out of that following of that Dharma. She had no resentment in her heart that she, Yudhishthira Maharaj and Arjuna and Bhima, they followed the path of Dharma and they ditched me. There was no such resentment in Draupadi's heart. On the other hand, she was completely proud of her husband that even in that position, they followed the path of Dharma.

#### Dhritarashtra's Dual Personality, Duryodhana's Greed, Dhritarashtra's Regret

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra also, Dhritarashtra realized that."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Dhritarashtra's internal conflict, his love for both the Pandavas and Duryodhana, and his regret at allowing the events to escalate to the point of Draupadi's attempted disrobing, highlighting Duryodhana's greed and lustful desires.

So finally, Dhritarashtra, when he saw that things had gone too far, maybe Dhritarashtra's whole thing was, as we have seen, his dual personality. He had love for the Pandavas, he had love for his younger brother, as well as he had too much love for Duryodhana and the throne. And that love for Duryodhana and the throne overwhelmed his love for the Pandavas. So maybe Dhritarashtra had no intention to insult the Pandavas like that. His intention would have been to just get the kingdom and be happy with that. Although actually even Indraprastha was not his. Hastinapura itself, the throne of Hastinapura which he and Duryodhana were occupying, that did not belong to them. That was actually, you can look at it, because of the magnanimity of the Pandavas. They were able to occupy that throne. Otherwise, the Pandavas were the rightful heirs to that throne, not Duryodhana, not Dhritarashtra. But look at the greed of Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra when the Pandavas, from scratch, they built up their own kingdom. They wanted to go and occupy that. They were committing that. So Dhritarashtra's eye was on the opulence of Indraprastha. But even he didn't want to go and occupy that. He had not expected that it would go to the extent of trying to disrobe Draupadi. That was too much. Dhritarashtra also realized that. But by that time, before he could step in, already the act had happened. Everything was happening very swiftly. You see, now we are looking at that whole event in hindsight. But when they were in that, in that whole assembly, when everything was going on, people sometimes have brain fakes. You know, that's a common terminology we use nowadays. Some people have brain fakes. Sometimes some people, even though they have full understanding and the knowledge to be able to act properly in a situation, sometimes people, out of some brain fade at that point of time, they do something which is contrary to what should be done. That was, similar thing could have happened with Dhritarashtra also, because of which he did not step in at the right time. But when it had gone to this extent, and when he saw Bhima taking vow after terrible vow, that was the end. That was the end. That shook Dhritarashtra out of his slumber, weak slumber that he was in and he realized things had gone too far and he understood that this was something which he had not bargained for. Whereas, you see, in the case of Duryodhana, he wanted, he coveted their kingdom also and he also wanted to insult the Pandavas and he wanted to satisfy his lusty desire towards Draupadi. He got that opportunity and he tried to make, take full advantage of that. So, Dhritarashtra knew about Duryodhana's love for the throne, but he did not know about his lusty desires towards Draupadi. If he had known earlier, probably he would have taken steps to prevent this.

#### Dhritarashtra's Conciliation, Inevitable War, Pandavas' Dishonor

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra woke up and then he immediately put a stop to everything."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Dhritarashtra's attempt to rectify the situation by returning the Pandavas' kingdom and seeking forgiveness, while acknowledging the inevitability of future conflict and emphasizing that the shame rested on the Kauravas, not the Pandavas.

Dhritarashtra woke up and then he immediately put a stop to everything. And what did Dhritarashtra do? He, in order to pacify the Pandavas, he returned everything that the Pandavas had lost. He returned the kingdom to Yudhishthira Maharaj and then he begged them to forgive Duryodhana and others for whatever had happened and he told them, let us forget and forgive. Although at heart, Dhritarashtra also knew that this is not something which the Pandavas are going to forget, nor is Bhima going to forget as well. This is going to create a big war in the future and all my sons are going to be in great peril. Dhritarashtra knew this, but still he was trying to use conciliatory word to try to, as far as possible to postpone the inevitable. That was Dhritarashtra's mode. And then Dhritarashtra, he said. He was a great man. He was a great man. In front of, publicly in front of everyone he announced that Yudhishthira, he actually he commended the Pandavas, he commended Yudhishthira Maharaj for standing by virtuosity, by standing by Dharma even in such great distress and having trying to and he used many conciliatory words and tried to console Draupadi also and then finally he dissolved the assembly and asked everyone to go back to their respective places. So the Pandavas accompanied by Draupadi with a very heavy heart they took their belongings, mounted on their chariots and started back to Indraprastha, their minds completely disturbed and their hearts heavy with the insult that they had faced, with the dishonor that they had suffered from the Pandavas and they tried to console Draupadi with the insult that they had suffered from the Pandavas and they tried to console Draupadi. However, we have to understand that when a person gets insulted on account of some mistake he has done, it is a cause for great pain, but the Pandavas underwent such great dishonor not for any fault of theirs, so there was no shame on their part. The shame entirely rested on Duryodhana, Karna, Dushyasana and all the Dhritarastha and all these people. So now when the assembly was dissolved, they were all in a state of great pain and they resolved. Everybody left to their respective residences and slowly the hall petered out and it became empty. The Pandavas left for Indraprastha, Bhishma went back to his quarters, Vidura went back to his palace, Dhritarastha went back to his room and the entire hall, all the people who had assembled slowly they all left the assembly hall. Gradually the assembly hall became empty except for a few people. Who are these people and what were they waiting in that hall for? Join us in our next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna. Jagat Guru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai! Netai Gor Premanande Hari Hari Bol!

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode and sets up the current one, focusing on the reactions of Duryodhana and his allies after Dhritarashtra reverses his decision and returns the Pandavas' possessions.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the previous episode we have seen how after the game of dice, good sense prevailed over Dhritarashtra and he returned all those things which had been wrongfully, by way of cheating, had been taken away from the Pandavas by Shakuni and Duryodhana. After the game of dice, after Dhritarashtra returned everything and he spoke a few conciliatory words to Draupadi and to the Pandavas, he dissolved the assembly and everyone left the assembly hall. After everyone left the assembly hall, a few people remained back and they were looking at each other and who are these people and what were their thoughts. Stay with us today to learn about that. The Pandavas after leaving the assembly, they stepped out of the place and they got onto their chariots and they left Hastinapura. They drove back to Indraprastha. Their hearts were heavy. Their thoughts were filled with all those words of insults and the attempt to disrobe Draupadi. The wounds were still fresh in their hearts and the Pandavas were still festering. The Pandavas, although at that moment, at that point of time, there was no way they could vent out their anger and frustration, carrying these heavy thoughts in their mind, they were going back to Indraprastha. After they had gone out of Hastinapura and they had travelled some distance, they were told that somebody was coming on a horseback trying to catch up with them. Soon the person who was on horseback caught up with the Pandavas and they saw that this person on horseback was one of the servants from the Hastinapura palace. This servant, he came with a message to Yudhishthira Maharaj and to the Pandavas. He said, Yudhishthira Maharaj. The Pandavas were surprised. They, after all that had happened, they just left the assembly and they had set out back to Indraprastha. But suddenly this messenger turned up and this messenger said that he was carrying a message for the Pandavas from Dhritarashtra. What was this message that Dhritarashtra had chosen to send to the Pandavas? Actually what had happened? After the game of dice and the Pandavas were returned their kingdom and whatever they had lost at the stakes and that they had left the hall and all the others who are present in the assembly had all left, Dhritarashtra had left, Bhishma had left, Drona had left and all the other people whoever were present in that assembly, they had all left. Now after everyone had left, Duryodhana, Karna, Shakuni and Dushasana were left and they were looking at each other because for them it was a great shock. For all of them, they had almost won everything but at the last moment Dhritarashtra's decision had turned the tables, so they were still in shock of what had happened. Finally Dushasana spoke up, that old man has gone senile, we had the Pandavas and their kingdom in our grip and he left it off just like that. Buddha satya gaya hai jo hamare haath mein aaya tha nikal gaya moose nivala nikal gaya kai ketna du vaai ketala hai anda kelavan yedukuthaan ipdi pannano a kelavan ayalak endu iti wap affah diyauta just jangal kaiyila vannadana ellan na sipitu kai bantit baayi kukki barili la muduka aapet illa halaput lie mandit kai k bandit baayi qaratu upmunche muduka illa halpa puta

**Summary:** The speaker explains Duryodhana's fear of direct confrontation with the Pandavas and Shakuni's plan to manipulate them into another game of dice.

So these were the feelings of Dushasana. Duryodhana also felt alike but there was nothing they could do, what to do. But if the matter had been just that, that the Pandavas had been returned their kingdom, it would not have been much of an issue. But the issue was that the Pandavas had been subjected to such great insults that they were not going to keep quiet. On some pretext or the other, Duryodhana was afraid they would take a war with the Kauravas. Then it would be very difficult because Duryodhana very well knew the prowess of the Pandavas. All along until now, he had been trying to avoid direct confrontation but to somehow through some cunning means, somehow cheat them of their kingdom and cheat them of their royal authority. These were his plans. So all along he had always avoided direct confrontation because Duryodhana knew that if he were to directly face the Pandavas in battle, he would not be able to succeed. Chakuni then spoke up and he told Duryodhana whatever happened, happened. Now you see, we cannot directly engage in a battle with the Pandavas. We cannot afford that. Somehow Hastinapura was not ours. We have got it in our hand. Now if we get into a battle with the Pandavas and lose Hastinapura also in our greed for Indraprastha, then we are left with, we are neither here nor there. So we have to think of something

**Summary:** The speaker details Shakuni's plan for another game of dice and Duryodhana's efforts to convince Dhritarashtra, emphasizing the desire to preempt a potential war by sending the Pandavas into exile.

immediately. Then Chakuni said, I have got a plan by which we can still save the situation. What is that? Chakuni said, somehow if we convince the Pandavas again for another game of dice, then somehow we can manage to win back whatever we want. Now neither Karna nor Duryodhana nor Dushyasana were in favor of a direct fight with the Pandavas because everybody knew they could not win. What Chakuni was proposing seemed to be the only solution. But then how to do it? How could the Pandavas again be brought back to another game of dice? Duryodhana took the task upon himself and went and met Dhritarashtra. He spoke to his father and he tried various ways to convince Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra was like, no, no, why? He was not in favor of it. He said, already one game of dice, so much bad blood has happened between the two of you. One more game of dice, there will be no stopping the, stopping a war between the two of you. So Dhritarashtra was not in favor. Finally Duryodhana told Dhritarashtra, my dear father, Dhritarashtra has gone out of control. Sooner or later the Pandavas will gather some, on some pretext or the other, they will gather an army and attack us. We have to preempt this. So the only preemptive fight that we can do is, you have to call them for another game of dice and we have to ensure that we win back the kingdom. Now, if we don't do that, we have to call them for another game of dice. If we don't do that, then what are we doing? We are inviting trouble. Because it is, the Pandavas are now like snakes who have been trampled upon. Once we trample upon a snake's head, after that you cannot think of just walking away silently. The snake will follow you and it will attack you and it will try to bite you. The only way is, you have to defend yourself. If you have to take protective measures. Duryodhana, hence, told Dhritarashtra that the only way to take a preemptive action is to prevent a battle from happening, which can only be done if the Pandavas are somehow sent out away from Indraprastha and we have to send them in exile somewhere. And for that, the only way is to engage them again in another game of dice. Not only this, Duryodhana told Dhritarashtra, let us engage them in a game of dice and let's take this time. Duryodhana told Dhritarashtra that the only way is to engage them again in another game of dice and let's take this time. And for that, the only way is to engage them again in another game of dice and let's take this time. And if the Pandavas are in exile for a sufficient period of time, Duryodhana said, with all the wealth in Indraprastha and with all the kings, I will get all the kings on my side and then my power will become really strong and the Pandavas, whenever they come back, they will not be able to face us. They will not be able to withstand the power of my army.

#### Gandhari's advice, righteousness, evil, fate

**Key Quote:** "please hand over the kingdom to the Pandavas and banish Duryodhana from the family."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Gandhari's opposition to the game of dice and her advice to Dhritarashtra to favor the Pandavas, highlighting the conflict between righteousness and familial attachment.

Dhritarashtra, although he was hesitant, finally, Duryodhana's persuasive words finally overcame his hesitancy. So finally, Dhritarashtra agreed. And Dhritarashtra summoned the servant and sent him, dispatched him to order Yudhishthira for another game of dice. When Dhritarashtra took this decision and this decision came to be that the message started spreading everywhere that Dhritarashtra has again called for one more game of dice, the news reached Gandhari's ears. She came running to her husband and she said, I heard that you have called for one more game of dice. I have heard what Draupadi had to go through in that assembly. It is unthinkable how Draupadi could have been subjected to such ignominy. And somehow you salvage the situation by returning everything. Now you have gone round the bend. You are again calling for another game of dice. Really, I mean, what do you think of yourself? Do you understand the consequences of your action? This is absolutely, what you are doing is absolutely wrong. On the other hand, Gandhari, the mother of Duryodhana, she advised Dhritarasva. On the other hand, please hand over the kingdom to the Pandavas and banish Duryodhana from the family. You send him away from Hastinapura. Don't keep him here. This was a mother's advice to Dhritarasva. Duryodhana's own mother, she could see the evilness in Duryodhana and the righteousness of the Pandavas and she was fully in favour of the Pandavas and she said better to reject Duryodhana and avoid any sort of ill-will and fighting within the family. But Dhritarasva, what was Dhritarasva's response? He told Gandhari, you see Gandhari, whatever I have to do, I have done. Now, whatever happens, by the will of providence, let it happen. I cannot help it. And he walked off. Now, Gandhari, what could she do? She had tried her best. She went back.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Yudhishthira's acceptance of the invitation to another game of dice, emphasizing the Kshatriya's duty to uphold dharma and honor the commands of elders, even at personal cost.

And finally, this messenger, despatched by Dhritarasva, had now reached the Pandavas and he was standing in front of Yudhishthira with the message from Dhritarasva. What was the message? The message was, the king is calling you, Yudhishthira Maharaja. For another game of dice. Yudhishthira looked at his brothers and he said, I am helpless. It is the duty of a Kshatriya never to say no to a challenge. Over and above this, Dhritarasva is in the position of my father. He is my elder. He is ordering, I cannot disobey him. The other brothers in Draupadi, they also understood and fully well they empathized with Yudhishthira Maharaja's position. And they could understand that there was hardly anything else they could do in the face of following the rules of Dharma. Actually, what we have to understand is, there are rules of Dharma for protecting oneself. And then there are higher rules. There are secondary principles and there are higher principles. At a very individual level, if I am very selfish, I take care of myself. Now, I am not living alone in this society. I am living in the midst of so many relatives, friends, servants, so many people are serving me, so many animals. And there are so many demigods, devatas who are providing me so much facilities and conveniences in nature. So, I am living in the midst of all of these things. So, I have duty towards my own, taking care of my own welfare. Then, I also have to think about higher principles. Welfare of my family. Then, welfare of my friends and relatives. Welfare of the entire humankind. Welfare of other animals. Welfare of this earth. Welfare of this environment. We have responsibility towards all these things. At an individual level, if you see, the Pandavas knew that this game of dice is not going to augur well for them. It will bring about their own downfall. But then, as Kshatriyas, they had to rise above the principles of taking care of one's own welfare. As Kshatriyas, they had higher principles to follow. So, since they were Kshatriyas, since they were rulers, those principles took precedence over their personal welfare. So, Yudhisthira could not refuse Dhritarashtra's order and he came back

for the second game of dice. Now, when the second game of dice started, again, it was the same assembly. The Dhritarashtra was sitting at the head of the assembly surrounded by Bhishma, Drona, Vidura and opposite Yudhisthira Maharaj to play the game of dice was Duryodhana and on his behalf as usual, it was Shakuni casting the dice. The entire assembly was very unhappy. Everyone was censuring Dhritarashtra that why is he doing this? But then, Dhritarashtra was completely under the control, under the sway of his greedy son and he could not help it. Although he knew at his heart that what he was doing was completely wrong. Now, in the second game of dice, Shakuni spoke to Yudhisthira Maharaj and in the being audible to the entire audience, Shakuni put the conditions of the game. Shakuni informed Yudhisthira Maharaj and the rest of the assembly, whatever we played, we played and somehow we won, you lost, let us forget all those things. Now, it is a new game of dice and here the stakes are much higher. If Duryodhana and I lose in this game of dice, then we all Kauravas will leave our kingdom and we will live in the forest in exile for 12 years. And in the 13th year, we will live in some city or village or town, incognito, in disguise, such that nobody can recognize us. And if the 13th year we are able to pass successfully without your detecting us, where we are and who we are, then in the 14th year, you will return the kingdom to us. Suppose, in the 13th year of exile, you recognize us, you manage to find us out and you are able to spot us, you are able to see through our disguise and identify us, then we will go back to another 12 years of forest exile and one more year of incognito, living in incognito. And then Shakuni said, if we lose, this is the condition. And if you lose, the same conditions will be applicable to you. Look at Shakuni's cunning nature. He did not immediately say that, if you lose, these are the conditions. He said, if we lose, these are the conditions and if you lose, then same conditions will be applicable to you, making it appear very fair.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates Yudhishthira's acceptance of the conditions and his subsequent loss, leading to the Pandavas' exile and fueling Bhima's anger and vows of revenge.

Now, Yudhisthira Maharaj looked at Dhritarashtra, that what he had to say. Dhritarashtra was silent. Then Yudhisthira Maharaj said, I am bound by the instructions of my elder, which is Dhritarashtra, and therefore I unwillingly am accepting these conditions. Let the dice roll. And then Shakuni cast the dice. And when the dice was cast, again, Yudhisthira Maharaj lost the game of dice and Shakuni won the game of dice. Now, it was decided that the Pandavas will have to go for twelve years in forest exile followed by one year of living incognito. As far as the Kauravas were concerned, they were thrilled. Duryodhana's heart's desire had been fulfilled. Shakuni's plan had worked and the Kauravas were now in control of the kingdom of the Pandavas, Indraprastha. And Duryodhana was gleeful and he was thinking, now with time, by the time the Pandavas have finished their twelve years of exile, I would have consolidated my power, they will not be able to come back and oppose me. And after that one year of living incognito, very tough, I will be able to somehow figure them out. That was Duryodhana's thinking. And Duryodhana and the Kauravas started heaping more insults on the Pandavas. They started making fun of them. And Bhima could not control his fury and he reiterated his vow. He reminded Dushyasana, you are laughing at us now, remember I am going to, in the battle field, I am going to tear open your chest and drink your blood. And Duryodhana, you also remember, very soon we will face each other in battle and that day I will break your thighs and I will see that you bite the dust.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the Pandavas' preparations for exile, including entrusting Kunti to Vidura's care and sending their sons to different locations for safety and education.

So, the second game of dice only increased the fire of anger in Bhima's heart. Not only Bhima's heart, all the Pandavas' heart. Now, the Pandavas got ready. They had to, since they had to live in the forest, they could not go there with all their jewelry and their royal clothes and all that. They had to give it up and take on deer skin and tree bark and remove all their ornaments and carrying just their weapons and this very simple attire, they set out for the forest. Vidura told the Pandavas that this condition of this game of dice was not for Kunti Devi. She is already very elderly and she would not be able to bear the rigors of twelve years in the forest. So, therefore, Vidura requested the Pandavas to entrust Kunti in his care and as long as the Pandavas would not return, Kunti could remain in his house. And as far as the sons of the Pandavas were concerned, they were sent to Drupada, to Draupadi's father's place where they could grow up and they could be trained in the various duties of the Kshatriyas. Subhadra, with her young son Abhimanyu, she was sent back to Dwaraka. So, as the Pandavas' sons grew up, sometimes they would spend some time in Panchaladesha along with in Drupada's palace and sometimes they would go to Krishna's place in Dwaraka, spend some time there and like this they would, they grew up in these two households. In the meantime, the Pandavas now got ready and they left for the forest and this is how the Pandavas had to leave Indraprastha and Duryodhana won over Indraprastha in this manner and the Pandavas left for the forest. Now, what all happened in the forest when the Pandavas went on exile? Continue to remain with us and in the next few episodes we will look at what all travails the Pandavas had to undergo in the forest during their time of exile.

**Key Quote:** "At that time Shalva promised to his friend Shishupala, that, this insult to you, I will take revenge of it."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the reason why Krishna had to leave Indraprastha and return to Dwaraka: Shalva's attack, motivated by revenge for Krishna's abduction of Rukmini.

Today, we will start with some of the incidents that happened a little previously to the Game of Dice. After the Rajasuya Ejna was performed by Yudhishthira Maharaj, we all had seen how Lord Krishna stayed back in Indraprastha for a few days. After staying there for a few days, Lord Krishna, along with his retinue, he returned back to Dwaraka. Actually, for Krishna to go back to Dwaraka from Indraprastha, there was a catalyst, there was a reason why Krishna had to go back to Dwaraka. When Krishna was in Indraprastha with the Pandavas, staying in their palace built by Mayadanava, suddenly they got a news. It was not a good news, it was a matter of great concern. And what was this news? A friend of Shishupala by the name Shalva, who was a king, had attacked Dwaraka. Now, why did Shalva attack Dwaraka? When Krishna kidnapped, abducted Rukmini upon her request from her marriage, which was arranged by her brother against her wishes with Shishupala, Shishupala had brought all of his friends for the wedding. King Shalva was one amongst those who had come to attend the wedding of Shishupala. But then Krishna took away Rukmini. And although King Shalva's kingdom had come to an end even though all of Shishupala's army tried to stop Krishna, Balarama, who had come there to support his younger brother, he very easily defeated all of them and drove them back. At that time Shalva promised to his friend Shishupala, that this insult to you, I will take revenge of it. I will get some benediction by worshiping Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is in Machhtfatakana, which is one of the most crunches from Pandavas. Lord Shiva is in Machhtinese. Lord Shiva is in Machht hedge. God Chorge has 지금은 taken over K style farms. God Chorge has become Rywal masks. Arjun is giving a cheque for him as well. God Shalka, they have such pretty hats for him. That was for K 장ra by his name, isn't he? By which I will finish all the Yadavas and I will kill Krishna. Of course, who can kill Krishna? Who can touch Krishna? It is not possible. But then there are some foolish people, some atheists who think like that.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Shiva said, okay, is that all you want? Take it, take it."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Shalva performed austerities to please Lord Shiva and obtained an invincible airship, which he then used to attack Dwaraka.

Who think that they are strong enough, powerful enough to attack Krishna and kill him. So, this Shalva, he undertook severe austerity. And he meditated upon Lord Shiva. He would every day eat only a few handfuls of ash. And he would execute other various austerities like this. And Lord Shiva is Ashutosh. He is pleased very quickly. And he could not tolerate, because Lord Shiva is a great Vaishnava, is a great devotee of Lord Krishna, and all devotees of Lord Krishna are naturally very soft hearted and very compassionate. When Lord Shiva saw that this Shalva was eating just a handful of ash every day and subjecting himself to so much torture, Lord Shiva could not tolerate out of compassion and appeared before him. And he asked Shalva, what do you want? Why are you taking so much austerity? Shalva told him, I want a ship, an airship, which cannot be destroyed by any human or any animal or by any man-made weapon. And I want that this airship should be very fearsome to the Yadavas. Lord Shiva said, okay, is that all you want? Take it, take it. Somehow Lord Shiva wanted to stop his severe austerity. Now this Shalva, now with this airship, he took his whole army, and he attacked Dwaraka. There were his foot soldiers and cavalry and all such other portions of his army, which attacked Dwaraka on the ground, while Shalva himself, seated on his airship, made an air attack upon Dwaraka simultaneously. And this airship was not like our modern Rafals or any such small aircraft, which only two or three people can sit and drive. This airship was practically like a whole city, and it was equipped with various kinds of facilities, and a mini army could be accommodated within that airship. Not only that, the airship had even the ability of night vision. Even if the entire environment was immersed in darkness, the pilot could still manage to navigate the airship. So with this kind of arrangement, with his air power and with his ground force, Shalva attacked Dwaraka, and they started tearing apart all the different multi-storied buildings that had been built there. They destroyed the parks. They started attacking various houses, and they created a big bhangama in Dwaraka city. Now at that time, Lord Krishna was in Indraprastha.

**Key Quote:** "Our whole dynasty, nobody has ever run away from the battlefield. And you have taken away me from the battlefield."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the battle between Krishna's sons, led by Pradyumna, and Shalva's army, focusing on Pradyumna's temporary defeat and subsequent return to the battlefield.

After the Rajasuya Ejna. In Dwaraka at that time, only Krishna's sons were present. Immediately, all the sons of Krishna headed by Pradyumna, they responded to this attack with their own army. And Pradyumna and the others, Pradyumna, Samba and Satyaki, all these people came out onto the battlefield, and they gave a very good fight to the army of Shalva. And even though Shalva's army was huge, still the army of the Yadavas headed by Pradyumna was up to the task and they managed to beat them back. Now when this fight was going on in real earnest between these two parties, what happened? One of the commanders of Shalva by the name Dhiman, he suddenly, without warning, attacked Pradyumna because he was the foremost commander of the Yadava army. Dhiman attacked him with his mace and struck him a severe blow on his chest, and Pradyumna reeled from the sudden force of that attack and he fell down unconscious on his chariot. The charioteer immediately seeing that Pradyumna had gone unconscious, and any moment any of the enemy soldiers can capture him, immediately he drove the chariot away from the battlefield, and he took him to a place of safety, and then he sprinkled some water on him and then tried to massage his feet and slowly he brought Pradyumna back to consciousness. When Pradyumna recovered, he woke up and he started looking around and he saw, I am not on the battlefield. And then he started chastising his chariot driver, what have you done? Our whole dynasty, nobody has ever run away from the battlefield, and you have taken away me from the battlefield. If I had died on the battlefield, at least my name would have been glorified that I died fighting. Now people, everyone will make fun of me. Look at this fellow who was born in the Yadava family, the only guy in the Yadava family who ran away from the battlefield. Not only my enemies will make fun of me, even my relatives will make fun of me. My brothers will make fun of me. My sisters-in-law, they will make all kinds of memes about me. So what will I do? I cannot tolerate this. Then the charioteer replied to Pradyumna, Oh my lord, I was simply doing my duty as a charioteer. When you fell unconscious, I had to take care of your safety and so I brought you to a safe place. This is perfectly according to the codes of warfare. So you will definitely not be considered as a coward who ran away from the battlefield because you are unconscious. You did not run away. I took you away from the battlefield. So please recuperate yourself and let us go back to the battlefield. Pradyumna immediately understood the situation and he was pacified and he drank some water, refreshed himself and he came back to the battlefield. And as soon as he came back to the battlefield, Pradyumna, first of all, he challenged Dhiman and there was an intense fight, battle between the two of them. Finally, Pradyumna overcame Dhiman and he managed to vanquish him and Dhiman fell down dead in the battlefield.

**Key Quote:** "And Krishna's arrow started wreaking havoc in Shalva's army."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates Krishna's arrival in Dwaraka, his battle with Shalva, and the ultimate defeat of Shalva and his army.

Now while all this was going on, the news was taken by a messenger from Dwaraka to Lord Krishna in Indraprastha. And that is how Krishna decided, Oh, this kind of battle has started. I have to immediately leave, immediately leave for Dwaraka. And immediately Krishna took permission from Yudhishthira Maharaj and he came back to Dwaraka. The moment Krishna reached the presence of Dwaraka, he saw this raging battle going on between his sons and headed by Pradyumna and the army of Shalva and this huge fearsome airship flying in the air. So Krishna immediately spoke to Balaram and told him, You better go inside the city and take care of the elders like Ugrasena and others, and I will take care of this Shalva who has attacked us. Don't worry. And so Balarama went inside and then Krishna blew his Khans and then entered the battlefield. The moment the Yadava soldiers saw in the distance the Krishna's flag staff mounted on his chariot, with Garuda, with the symbol of Garuda, the flag of Krishna's chariot carrying the symbol of Garuda, everybody understood, Oh, Krishna has now come. And Krishna's arrow started wreaking havoc in Shalva's army. Now Shalva was no mean guy and his airship was also not ordinary. Sometimes this airship of Shalva would be seen in the sky. Sometimes it will be suddenly seen resting on some mountain. Sometimes it would be seen on the water and sometimes nobody could see it. And the airship was moving at such high speed that it had generated a dust storm and everywhere nobody could actually see what was happening. When Krishna saw this, Krishna immediately started releasing his arrows and the power of his arrows was such that the whole airship of Shalva could not move. Shalva could not sustain its illusion that it was creating, and Krishna's feather-tipped arrows, they struck Shalva's airship and that airship crashed into the water, into the ocean. But Shalva managed to break free. He managed to jump out of the airship and he landed on the battlefield and then he rushed towards Krishna. And Krishna and Shalva engaged in quite a big fight and then Shalva was releasing his own arrows. Krishna was releasing his arrows. Finally, Krishna took his Sudarsana Chakra and beheaded Shalva, and the moment this happened, the entire army of Shalva broke up because their leader was no more. Their morale was broken. The entire army's power was broken and they were scattered.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna immediately took his club which was called Kaumodaki. And with that he gave one blow to Dantavakra. Dantavakra fell down there itself and died on the battlefield."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the narrative with the arrival and defeat of Dantavakra and Viduratha, highlighting Krishna's role in vanquishing those opposed to him.

And thus the Yadavas gained victory over Shalva. But then it did not end there. Right after that came one more guy, Dantavakra. And this Dantavakra, how did he came? He came walking with just one mace in his hand. And who was this Dantavakra? Dantavakra was the son of Sutadeva, who was one of the sisters of Vasudeva. So this Dantavakra was another cousin brother of Krishna, just like Shishupala. And this, although he was the cousin brother of Krishna, he was a friend of Shishupala and he also was inimical towards Krishna. With great anger, eyes red hot, this Dantavakra came on the battlefield, and he said, Oh Krishna, you are my cousin brother. Actually, I am not supposed to fight with you, but then you have killed me. But then you have killed my friend Shalva. Shalva was a very powerful friend of mine, but somehow, little bit inattention here and there, you cheated him and you killed him. But I am going to avenge my friend. You are forcing me to come on the battlefield. I will see to that I will avenge my friend. Like this, Dantavakra came on the battlefield. So this is just like, there is a maddened elephant which is running amok and creating havoc, and somebody tries to control the elephant by his words. Hey elephant, calm down, keep quiet. I will do this, I will do that. What your words can do to control a mad elephant? He cannot do anything. It is so powerful. So Dantavakra was thinking, simply by my words, I will subdue, I will control Krishna. But who can control Krishna? Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. So Krishna told Dantavakra, why are you simply talking? Come on, you take up your club and you avenge your friend Shalva. Let us see what you will do. So Dantavakra took his mace and powerfully struck Krishna on his shoulder. What was Krishna's response? Krishna did not bat an eyelid. He did not feel even like a leaf had struck him. Krishna immediately took his club which was called Kaumodaki, and with that he gave one blow to Dantavakra. Dantavakra fell down there itself and died on the battlefield. So Shalva was killed, and now Dantavakra who came to support him was also killed. But then demons are not one. They have many many supporters. So it didn't end there. Now came his brother Viduratha. Now this Viduratha was another demon like Dantavakra and Shichupala, and he also came and attacked Krishna. Krishna simply used his Sudarsana Chakra and he finished Viduratha also. And so like this all these demons who were against Krishna were all vanquished, and Dwaraka was again safe.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna purposely did not intervene in that game of dice."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while Krishna was engaged in battle in Dwaraka, the Pandavas were being cheated in the game of dice, and Krishna allowed it to happen as part of his divine plan to annihilate the demoniac kings.

And like this Krishna entered the palace of Dwaraka. Actually while all this fight was ensuing between Krishna and Dantavakra and Shalva and Viduratha and all these people, what had happened? The Pandavas had been invited to Hastinapura, and they had been cheated of their kingdom in the game of dice, because Krishna was engaged in this battle so severely here, he was unable to attend. Otherwise Krishna would have rushed to the rescue of the Pandavas. But still Krishna being the supreme personality of Godhead, He is present as Paramagma in everybody's heart. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, that Sarvasya Chaham Hrithi Sannivishtha, and seated as Paramagma in everyone's heart. Although Krishna was standing there in the battlefield in front of Dwaraka, fighting with Shalva and Dantavakra and all these people, simultaneously Krishna protected the honor of Draupadi in that assembly. So Krishna could have stopped that game of dice, the game of dice also, but then Krishna did not do so, because it was Krishna's will, that this would become the avenue for Krishna to fulfill the purpose of his descent to this material world, which was to annihilate all the demoniac kings who were simply engaged in economic development and military aggrandizement all over the world. If you may recall that was the original purpose for Krishna's descent, and Krishna wanted to assemble all these demoniac kings in one place and finish them all at once, rather than going after them one by one, one by one, one by one. So in order to give effect to that purpose of Krishna's, Krishna purposely did not intervene in that game of dice.

**Key Quote:** "Despite all these calamities in their lives, the Pandavas, not once have they complained that, O Krishna, we are your devotees. Why is this happening to us?"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates Narada Muni's conversation with Krishna, highlighting the Pandavas' unwavering devotion and unconditional love for Krishna despite their suffering.

Now Narada Muni came to Dwaraka, and he approached Krishna, and Narada Muni is a great devotee of Krishna. He is a pure devotee. He is an unalloyed devotee of Krishna. So sometimes devotees of Krishna out of great loving affection joke with Krishna. Narada Muni sarcastically started speaking to Krishna. Krishna, the Pandavas are such great devotees of yours. They know nothing other than you. They have dedicated their life, their wealth, their everything to your lotus feet, and you have given them such a wonderful reward, such a wonderful boon, benediction you have given them in return. So Krishna said, what is that that I have given? Because of your benediction, Pandavas are now bereft of their kingdom, and Draupadi has been insulted in that assembly. She was tried to be disrobed. Dushyasana and Karna have heaped insult after insult upon them, and very nicely they are now living in the forest. Narada was indirectly criticizing Krishna, that you see, they are such unalloyed devotees, such great devotees of yours, and look at the suffering they are having to undergo on account of that. But then, Narada Muni was not really criticizing Krishna like that. Further, what Narada Muni said was more important. Narada Muni said, but then Krishna, one thing I am seeing in the Pandavas. Despite all this, despite their kingdom being taken away by cheating, despite Draupadi being tried to be disrobed in that assembly, despite being insulted by sharp words of Karna and Dushyasana and Duryodhana, despite having lost their kingdom, despite having to live in the forest for twelve years, despite having to live in incognito for one year after that, despite all these things, despite all these calamities in their lives, the Pandavas, not once have they complained that, O Krishna, we are your devotees. Why is this happening to us? On the other hand, their love for you is only increasing day by day. Every such incident, calamity that happens in their life, their love for you increases. This is incomprehensible. How this is happening. I cannot understand this. This is inexplicable. Nobody can explain the love that the Pandavas have for you. This is the nature of your devotees. Actually, the love that the Pandavas exhibited for Krishna, that unmotivated, unconditional love of the Pandavas for Krishna, such love that no matter what calamity happened in their life, their love for Krishna could never be questioned. It would never be affected.

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee always, whenever he comes across any difficulty in his life, in his heart he is not suffering any difficulty. He is only experiencing the bliss of Krishna's protection."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the perspective of a pure devotee, who sees difficulties as a result of past karma and experiences Krishna's protection even in the midst of suffering, ending with a teaser for the next episode.

This is a common characteristic of all devotees of Krishna. You look at Prahlad Maharaj. How much difficulty he had to undergo by his own father's hands, but still, never once did he question, never once did he complain, O Krishna, why is this happening to me? Not once. So the Srimad Bhagavatam says that this is the characteristic of the devotees of Krishna. The devotees, their thinking is, whenever they come across any difficulty in their life is, they think that this difficulty is coming into my life because of my past sinful activities. So, somebody may say, that okay, why don't the devotees go and pray to Krishna, please remove my difficulty? No, the devotees don't pray to Krishna to remove their difficulty. Why? Because the devotee thinks, that according to the sinful activities that I have done in my past, I should have got a mountain of miseries, but Krishna has reduced me to a small, mole hill and he has given. Look at Krishna's mercy. He has reduced my misery to such a small thing, that very easily I am able to tolerate it. So, a devotee never asks Krishna to remove his misery. A pure devotee always, whenever he comes across any difficulty in his life, in his heart he is not suffering any difficulty. He is only experiencing the bliss of Krishna's protection. See, this much distress has come in my life. If Krishna was not there in my life, I would have had to suffer much, much more, but Krishna has sent it as only a small, simple problem that very easily can be crossed over. This is how devotees are always wrapped in their love for Krishna. So also the Pandavas. Now, Krishna, when he heard, that in his absence, so much injustice has happened with the Pandavas and that they are now living in the forest in exile, what did Krishna do? Please join us in our next episode of the Mahabharata to learn about this. Thank you for joining us today.

Hare Krishna and welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. The last episode we had seen how the Pandavas have gone to the forest in exile after losing the game of dice. Purpureыйæ parله aime Lord Krishna being engaged in a battle with Shalva, Dantavakra, and Viduratha, he could not be present in the game of dice to support the Pandavas. So Krishna, when he got the news in Dvaraka that the game of dice had taken place, the Pandavas had been cheated of their kingdom, and they were now living in forest exile, Krishna immediately rushed to meet the Pandavas. The Pandavas, after losing the game of dice, as per the conditions, they left Indraprastha, and Indraprastha was taken over by Duryodhana. The Pandavas retired to the forest. There, they had built a small hermitage comprising simple patch cottages and mud flooring. They were living by wearing dresses made of tree bark. They would have to cook whatever jungle vegetables were available, and they were leading a very simple life like this. Krishna, when he came to meet the Pandavas, he was very much sorrowful to see the condition of the Pandavas, who are his great devotees. Draupadi fell at the lotus feet of Krishna and cried piteously, describing to him how she had been dragged by her hair by Dushasana into that assembly, that is, the Rajasuya Yajna assembly, and tried to be disrobed. Of course, it's not that Krishna was unaware of all this. However, Draupadi wanted to vent her grief. She wanted to share her sorrow, and Krishna was her beloved Supreme Lord, and therefore she narrated the whole incident to him. And Draupadi explained to Krishna how her hair, which had been so glorified in that Rajasuya Yajna, that by that very hair Dushyasana caught her and dragged her into that assembly. When Krishna heard what all had gone on in that assembly, Krishna's anger rose, and the Supreme Lord Krishna then, before the Pandavas, he said, "I promise all of you that all the sons of Dhritarashtra, they will have to meet you in the assembly in battle, and in the battlefield, when they engage in combat with you, all their wives will become widows. This is my promise unto you." And this was promised by Krishna to the Pandavas. And that decision, by that decision of Krishna, the lifespan of all the Kauravas was shortened. The defeat of Kurukshetra was inevitable, and the defeat of Duryodhana and his brothers was

**Key Quote:** "If we engage in pious activities, punya karma, then we are creating happiness for us in the future. If we engage in papa karma, sinful activities, we are creating distress for us in the future."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of karma, comparing pious and sinful activities to bank accounts that accumulate future happiness or suffering, contrasting Duryodhana's consumption of past piety with the Pandavas' accumulation of piety through austerities.

guaranteed by the anger of Krishna upon the Kauravas. It is said in the Vedas that whenever somebody insults a great personality, a great saint, or a great devotee of the Supreme Lord, by that act, the person reduces his lifespan and spoils his reputation and fame. Duryodhana had insulted, humiliated the Pandavas for no fault of theirs. He had humiliated Draupadi. All of them were great eternal devotees of the Supreme Lord. Duryodhana thought by doing this, he had achieved his goal of becoming a great saint. He had captured the kingdom of the Pandavas, which was Indraprastha, and he thought he had managed to cheat them. But in reality, what had happened, he had only reduced his lifespan, and forever he would be vilified and his reputation was foiled. At that point of time, Duryodhana could not understand this. So, while the Pandavas were fighting, Duryodhana could not understand this. So, while the Pandavas were fighting, Duryodhana could not understand this. So, while the Pandavas were fighting. But the Pandavas lived in austerity in the forest. Duryodhana enjoyed unrivaled sovereignty over the kingdom of both the Pandavas as well as that ruled over by Hastinapura. And he built up his alliances with various kings, and over a period of time, he became very powerful and very opulent. He was enjoying the opulences of the kings. He was enjoying the opulences of the kings. He was enjoying the opulences of the kings. He was enjoying the opulences of the kings. kingdom which rightfully belongs to the Pandavas. The Pandavas, on the other hand, they spent their time in the forest with various rishis, sages, understanding from them the finer aspects of Dharma, engaging in various yajnas and austerities, tapasya, vrata, and like this they increased their piety. Whereas Duryodhana, by enjoying that kingdom which was not rightfully his, he was reducing his piety. Piety and impiety, pious activities and sinful activities, the punya karma and the papa karma, they result in creating future happiness or suffering for us. If we engage in pious activities, punya karma, then we are creating happiness for us in the future. If we engage in papa karma, sinful activities, we are creating distress for us in the future. So the papa karma and the punya karma are like two bank accounts. They keep building up according to our activity. When we engage in pious activities, our balance in the punya karma account keeps increasing. The more balance we have in the Punya Karma, the greater happiness that we ensure for ourselves in the future life. And whenever we enjoy the result of that Punya or suffer the distress of some Papa Karma, the respective accounts of Punya and Papa start getting depleted. Therefore, while Duryodhana was enjoying the kingdom, he was consuming all of his past pious activities, whereas the Pandavas engaged in austerities and tapasya and engaging in various vows, engaged in various vratas and under and conducting various sacrifices, yajnas,

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that if we cook food and eat it without offering it to Krishna, we are eating verily only sin."
**Summary:** Yudhishthira Maharaj, unable to perform grand charities in exile, receives the Akshaya Patra from Suryadeva, enabling him to feed sages with Krishna prasadam, which is described as transcendental and freeing from sinful reactions.

they were building up their piety more and more. Now Yudhishthira Maharaj, because he was a very righteous king, he could not deviate from the duties of a Kshatriya. One of the prime duties of a Kshatriya is to engage in yajna and dana. This yajna, for the performance of the yajna, Yudhishthira managed to engage all the rishis who were there, the sages who were there in the forest. But for giving dana, he was no more a king. He was, he did not have access to various kinds of treasures to be able to give out gold and cows and such other things in charity. So at least the minimum that Yudhishthira Maharaj could do was to distribute yajna chishta, prasadam which had been offered in the yajna to Lord Vishnu. However, Yudhishthira Maharaj was facing difficulty even in that, because he was living in the forest and he did not have any sort of resources to be able to, to be able to cook such good foodstuff and offer in large quantities to the rishis. So when Yudhishthira Maharaj was feeling very despondent because of this, Dhaumya Rishi, who was the Kula Guru, who was the family priest of the Pandavas, he advised Yudhishthira Maharaj to worship Suryadeva, the sun god, and obtain a benediction from him by which he could be able to fulfill his desire of being able to distribute large quantities of yajna chishta or Vishnu's prasadam after conducting various sacrifices. Based on Dhaumya's instruction, Yudhishthira Maharaj engaged in tapasya, austerities, and he managed to please Suryadeva, the sun god, and the sun god, having understood his desire, gifted him a vessel, and he informed Yudhishthira Maharaj that whatever they would cook and serve from that vessel, the vessel would keep on supplying unlimited quantity of food until Draupadi takes her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. And she beckoned Yudhishthira Maharaj and told her, what if I swift away, why are you then? Why be slice up, what if I've Harma, Electoral attack, what happened in你的 head oretry make a arrives? Today's guest will be Yudhishthira Maharaj. Finally, Suryadeva was happy to meet Yudhishthira Maharaj and was surrounded by an eid festival inside the house in the room where he was staying. In the evening, the sun god, Yudhishthira Maharaj and the sun god, Yudhishthira Maharaj were gathered around... empty. And this vessel is the famous Akshaya Patra. Why is it called Akshaya Patra? Kshaya means to reduce. Akshaya means inexhaustible. So, because this vessel was inexhaustible, it could produce an unlimited quantity of food. Therefore, it was called Akshaya Patra. And now Yudhishthira Maharaj was very happy that now he could feed unlimited number of great exalted personalities, sages in the forest. And by doing this, he could continue his duties as a Kshatriya. So, like this, Yudhishthira Maharaj would conduct various sacrifices, and he would have Draupadi cook various food items to be offered to Lord Vishnu in that fire sacrifice. And he would have Draupadi cook various food items to be offered to Lord Vishnu in that fire sacrifice. And then he would distribute the Prasadam to all the sages. This is, this kind of activity is actually far beyond even Punya Karma, even pious activities. To feed a qualified person, like a Sadhu or a saintly person, is actually a Punya Karma, is a pious activity in itself. But then, Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that if we cook food and eat it without offering it to Krishna, we are eating verily only sin. On the other hand, if we cook food offered to Krishna and then partake of it, then we are freed from all sinful activities. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj, by feeding Vishnu's prasadam offered to Lord Vishnu in the sacrifices, in the yajnas, he was distributing Krishna prasadam to all the sages. And so, that prasadam was transcendental and its effect was,

**Key Quote:** "It was a golden lotus with a thousand petals."
**Summary:** The Pandavas continue their austere life on Gandhamadana Hill, where Draupadi finds a golden lotus, prompting Bhima to embark on a quest to find more, encountering challenges and a mysterious animal.

whoever would honor that prasadam, they would become free from all the reactions to their past activities. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj and the Pandavas and Draupadi spent their time very fruitfully within the forest, continuing to engage in their past activities, unlike Duryodhana, who was simply engaged in sense gratification and reducing the accumulations, all that he simply kept consuming without engaging in any pious activities, without engaging in dana, tapasya, yajna, etc., which are actually the duties of a Kshatriya, of a king. Like this, time passed and once the Pandavas happened to reach a place known as Kshatriya. Like this, time passed and once the Pandavas happened to reach a place known as Kshatriya. Like this, time passed and once the Pandavas happened to reach a place known as Gandhamadana Hill. This Gandhamadana Hill is said to be beyond even the Kailasa Parvatha in the Himalayas. The Pandavas had come there because it was considered a very holy place which even the celestials visit. During this time, Arjuna also went seeking favors from various devatas During this time, Arjuna also went seeking favors from various devatas During this time, Arjuna also went seeking favors from various devatas to accumulate various kinds of celestial weapons because as advised by Lord Krishna, Arjuna would have to collect all these things which would be necessary for him to engage in the forthcoming war which all the Pandavas could sense that it was going to be inevitable although they did not desire such a war. The Pandavas continued to live in austerity. The Pandavas continued to live in austerity. As I had mentioned earlier, the Pandavas continued to live in austerity. To pushes out the région, Heidi had to go into the parlour of огay and go to Kseti, etc., I had mentioned wearing a dress made out of tree barks, engaging in various kinds of austerities, tapasyas, vratas, etc., even on Gandhamadana hill. Once, while the Pandavas were there in Gandhamadana hill, Draupadi, one day in the morning, she found a gentle breeze blowing, and in the breeze, she found one flower floating towards her, and this flower was no ordinary flower. It was a golden lotus with a thousand petals. Generally, lotus has a few petals. Sahasra, Dala, Kamala, even within this world, to get a lotus, which has a thousand petals, is very, very rare. Now, this was a Sahasra, Dala, Kamala. It was a thousand-petal lotus, and it was also golden. When Draupadi saw this, her mind became very much attracted by this flower, and she thought, this is such a beautiful flower, I should offer this to my husband, Yudhisthira Maharaj, so that he can use it in his yajnas. Thinking like this, she picked up the flower. And then Bhima happened to be there, and she looked at Bhima, and she said, how I wish that we had more of these flowers, so that I could offer it to Yudhisthira Maharaj. So, Bhima looked at Draupadi, and he said, my dear lady, if that is your wish, I will carry it out. And so, what did Bhima do? Bhima looked at the direction in which the flower had come. The flower had come from a breeze which was flowing towards them, from the north-eastern direction. So, Bhima started walking through the forest in that path, in the direction from which the breeze was blowing. So, it was a forest. So, naturally, there were many animals. There were lions, there were tigers, elephants, and all such kinds of animals were occupying the forest. So, when Bhima started walking through the forest, he saw that there were many animals. So, when Bhima started walking in the forest, naturally, sometimes some animals would come and attack him. But Bhima very easily, very nonchalantly, he just slapped away lions and tigers and picked up elephants very nonchalantly and threw them away. He was so powerful. And so, like this, Bhima made his way in the direction of where, from where the breeze was blowing. He came across a beautiful lake. And there were many beautiful flowers there. There also Bhima searched, maybe I can find this golden thousand petal lotus here. But he could not find it. So, everywhere he was searching like this and he was going forward. So, finally, after travelling quite a distance, he came to a place where he saw a strange animal lying on his path. What was this strange animal? And what was it doing there? And how did it get there? And how did Bhima deal with it? Because for Bhima, until then, he had come across many ferocious animals in the forest and he had dispatched all of them very easily. So, for Bhima, it was not a big deal. So, he was not afraid upon seeing this somewhat different looking and wonderful animal. So, but then Bhima understood when he looked at this animal that this was no ordinary animal. All the other animals were not ordinary animals. All the other animals were not ordinary animals. Till then, whom he had met were all normal forest animals. But this animal seemed a little different. So, what was this animal? And when Bhima looked at it, he carefully looked at it analyzing, is this really an animal or is it some Rakshasa in disguise waiting to pounce upon me, attack me and when I am a little neglectful, when I am not a little careful, maybe he wants to capture me. So, Bhima looked at it and said, he wants to capture me. Bhima thinking in these ways, he approached, he cautiously he approached the animal. Now who was this animal and what happened when Bhima approached it? Please join us in the next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today.

**Summary:** Review of the previous episode, highlighting the Pandavas' pious activities in exile versus Duryodhana's sense gratification.

Welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the previous episode, we have seen how the Pandavas lived in the forest in exile, increasing their pious credit, by engaging in various kinds of austerities, tapasyas, conducting various Ejna's sacrifices with the help of the sages and the rishis in the forest, and distributing the Ejna Sista or Vishnu's Prasadam to everyone who attended their sacrifices. At the same time, we also saw how Guryodhana engaged in various kinds of sense gratification without engaging in activities of tapasya, dana, etc., thereby simply diminishing the pious credits he had accumulated over his past life. We also saw how when the Pandavas were living in Gandhamadana hill, Draupadi came across a beautiful golden thousand petaled lotus and she requested Bhima to get more of this at Bhima's temple.

**Key Quote:** "So the man was also very happy and he took the deities to his home and personally started worshipping them with great respect and affection."
**Summary:** A story from the time of Lord Ramachandra illustrating the deep connection between the Lord and His devotees, and the importance of deity worship.

To begin today's episode, we will take you to the time of Lord Ramachandra who ruled over the earth several millions of years ago during the age known as Treta Yuga. The current age in which we all live in is called Kali Yuga which lasts for 432,000 years out of which 5000 years have passed by. The age previous to this was called Dwapara Yuga which lasted for 864,000 years and the age previous to that was Treta Yuga which lasted for 1,296,000 years. It was during the time of Treta Yuga that Lord Ramachandra ruled over the world from his capital Ayodhya. Ayodhya is very close to the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh which is Lucknow. Now when Lord Ramachandra was ruling over Ayodhya accompanied by his brothers, the citizens were all great devotees of Lord Ramachandra and Lord Ramachandra also ruled over them exactly like a very loving father would take care of his children. There were many devotees who rendered loving devotional service to Lord Ramachandra during that time. There was one particular devotee of Lord Ramachandra in Ayodhya. His devotion to Lord Ramachandra was so great that every day he would come to the court, have darshan of Lord Ramachandra and then go back and only then he would have his meals. Without having darshan of Lord Ramachandra, one would never have darshan of Lord Ramachandra, this is a very rare fact. And there was a man without having first seen the supreme Lord Ramachandra. This man would never have his meals. Once Lord Ramachandra had to go out of Ayodhya for about five, six days on some important work. Now during this time this gentleman because he could not see Lord Ramachandra refused to eat anything; he would not even drink water. So like this, one day, two days, three days, days went by like this but this man would not relent from following his austerity, from following his vow. Lord Ramachandra, after finishing his work, when he returned to Ayodhya, then Lakshmana, his younger brother, introduced this gentleman, this devotee to Lord Ramachandra and he explained to him how this man was so devoted to Lord Ramachandra that while he was not there, he has not even taken a drop of water. So Lord Ramachandra was very much affected by this person's devotion and he thought that there may be some other instance like this where I may have to go out and if this person doesn't see me and he doesn't eat his food, it is not good. So Lord Ramachandra instructed Lakshmana to bring out a set of deities of Sita and Rama. These deities of Sita and Rama had been worshipped by the sun god and it had been handed over by him to his son, Ikshwaku and like this, generation after generation, he was worshipped by the sun god and he was worshipped by the deities of Sita and Rama. During Lord Ramachandra's time, when he was personally present, because of his personal presence, there was no need to worship those deities which had come, handed over from one king to the other in that dynasty in which Lord Ramachandra himself appeared. So when Lord Ramachandra was personally present, he said that there is no need for these deities right now and they were kept locked up in a closet. Lord Ramachandra recalled these deities and he instructed his younger brother, Lakshmana, to bring those deities and Lord Ramachandra gave it to that devotee and he told him that if for some reason you are not able to see me then you can see these deities of mine which is as good as seeing me personally so then you will not be any seglude about anyone. In his mind, Lord Ramachandra said that these deities, when they meet each other, this is meant to have atmosphere and though these deities are known but they know each other very well. When they meet each other, he will not touch these Deities for too long置 quite accurately. This 50-60e thick stone and he said Lord Ramachandra did not recognize these then you will not have to take the trouble of having to fast if on some day you are not

**Summary:** Explanation of the true happiness of devotees, which lies in serving and associating with the Lord, not in material pleasures.

So the man was also very happy and he took the deities to his home and personally started worshipping them with great respect and affection. So we can see from this exchange how the Supreme Lord is very very dear to his devotees. The devotees are also very dear to the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord takes every care possible to keep his devotees always happy. And when we say the Lord wants to keep his devotees happy, the devotees are not happy by engaging in some activities of sense gratification. They are not happy by having good food to eat, good clothes to wear, having a nice luxurious residence. They are not interested in all these things. What gives pleasure to the devotees is to be able to see the Lord, to be able to constantly chant the holy names of the Lord, to be able to constantly remember the past times of the Supreme Lord and to thus always remain in his association. So this, just like this devotee, he because he was a great devotee of Lord Ramachandra, Lord Ramachandra knew that nothing would satisfy him except to be always in his presence. And so the Lord understanding what would keep him happy.

**Key Quote:** "So Bhima told the monkey, you see, in your heart, Paramatma is there. So therefore, if I cross over your body, I will be crossing over Paramatma, which will be a great offense."
**Summary:** The story of Bhima encountering Hanuman in the forest, highlighting Bhima's respect for Paramatma present in all beings.

So now we come back to the forest where Bhima had come across this strange animal. Bhima looked upon this animal with wonder. This animal looked like an ordinary monkey, but then its whole body had a golden hue and it was faintly effulgent. And this monkey was lying on the ground as if he was sleeping in the path. So Bhima, because his path was blocked, he spoke to the monkey and he told him, that oh monkey, you are lying in my path, please wake up and give way. This monkey slowly raised its head and looked at Bhima and he said, I am very old, it is not possible for me to get up and all that. Why have you come here? Why are you troubling me like this? This is my place, you seem to be some new person, why do you want to go this way? So Bhima introduced himself. He said, I am Bhima, one of the Pandavas and I am going on this path searching for a golden thousand petaled lotus. So this monkey looked at Bhima and he told him, see that lotus what you are talking about is not available in all these ordinary earthly planets. It is there in the heavenly planet. And this path which you are walking on leads you to the heavenly planet. And so ordinary people like you and all cannot go to the heavenly planet. So you go back, don't trouble me, you go back. Now Bhima became very upset. He said, what do you think of yourself? Who are you to stop me? If you don't step aside on your own, I will pick you up and throw you aside. Now this monkey, he looked at him and he said, why are you troubling me? If you are so insistent that you want to go, you step over me and go, no, why I should get up and all this and you should throw me and all that. You just cross over me and you go. Then Bhima looked at the monkey and he said, you see, I cannot cross over you because as Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, sarvasya caaham hrithi sannyavishtha, the Lord as Paramatma is seated in every living entity's heart. So Bhima knew this, that Krishna is present as Paramatma in every living entity's heart, even in the heart of animals, not just human beings. Even in the heart of the monkey also, Paramatma is present. So Bhima told the monkey, you see, in your heart, Paramatma is there. So therefore, if I cross over your body, I will be crossing over Paramatma, which will be a great offense. Therefore I will not commit that offense of crossing over you, you will have to either get up and give me way, or I will pick you up and throw you aside. Then Bhima told the monkey, see, if I did not know this, that the Paramatma is there in your heart, I would have jumped across you very easily, just like Hanumanji jumped over

the ocean for Lord Ramachandra. So this monkey immediately looked at him and took notice and he said, Hanumana, who is this Hanuman? What did he do? Why did he jump across the ocean? So then Bhima told him that Hanumanji is a great devotee of Lord Ramachandra. So he said, Hanumanji, who is this Hanuman? Why did he jump across the ocean? So then Bhima told him that Hanumanji is a great devotee of Lord Ramachandra, and he was also Vanara like you. When Ramana, the Asura, he kidnapped Sita Devi, wife of Lord Ramachandra to search and find her out, Hanumanji jumped across the ocean and he delivered, he found where Sita Maya was and he came back and delivered the message to Ramachandra. Anyway that and all is separate. Now you get up and give way. So then the monkey said, see, it is very difficult for me to move. My tail is lying there. You, it is in one side. You remove my tail and then you walk across. So, then Bhima looked at him and he said, what monkey, you know, simply creating trouble for me. He wants me to pick up his tail and keep it aside. Okay, anyway, let me do it. He went and he used his left hand to pick up the tail of the monkey. Then Bhima is holding the monkey's tail and pulling. It is not moving. Bhima was little surprised. He thought very easily like, you know, monkey's tail, how difficult it is to move. So, then he thought very easily he will be able to move, but this is not moving. So, he was carrying his gada with him. He kept it aside and then he used his right hand also. With both hands, he started pulling. But this tail is not moving. So, Bhima realized, this is not some ordinary monkey and this is not some ordinary tail. So, he started putting his full effort because now, it was a matter. It was a matter of prestige for him. And he is using his full energy and power and he is perspiring, but this tail is not moving. Then Bhima stepped aside and he understood that this is not some ordinary monkey because Bhima's power is such that no ordinary person can face him and this ordinary monkey's tail is not able to lift. So, this is definitely some extraordinary being. So, Bhima stepped aside and then he apologized to the monkey. He said, it looks like you seem to be some celestial personality. You are not an ordinary monkey. I am sorry that I spoke to you in an insulting way. Please forgive me and please reveal yourself. Then this monkey looked at him and he said, you spoke about somebody called Hanuman, no? I am that Hanuman. Bhima was astonished. Oh, Hanumanji has come. He immediately offered his obeisances. And ultimately because Hanumanji is the son of Vayudev and Bhima was also begotten by Kunti Devi according to the blessings of Vayudev. In that sense, both of them are brothers also.

**Summary:** Hanuman hands over the deities of Sita and Rama to Bhima, tracing their lineage from Ikshwaku to Madhvacharya and the Udupi temple.

So, then Bhima was very happy to meet Hanumanji because Hanumanji is also a great devotee of the Lord. Bhima is also a pure devotee of the Lord. So, then Bhima asked, requested Hanumanji to narrate the whole Ramayana to him. And so, Hanumanji very ecstatically, he described the whole Ramayana pastime of the Supreme Lord Ramachandra to Bhima. Then Hanumanji was carrying deities of Sita and Rama tied around his neck. So, he took those deities and he handed it over to Bhima and he gave it to him and he said, these are the deities of Lord Rama and Sita which were originally worshipped by Ikshwaku himself. And during Lord Ramachandra's personal presence, these deities were not being worshipped, but the Lord handed it over to one devotee in his kingdom who, because that devotee had taken a vow not to eat anything until he would have darshan of the Supreme Lord. This is the same devotee who had gotten the deities of Sita and Rama from Lord Ramachandra himself. And when that devotee, as long as he was alive, he was worshipping those deities of Rama and Sita. But when the time came for him to depart, to give up his body, at that time, he handed over these Sita and Rama deities to Hanumanji. And Hanumanji, from that time, was carrying it in a piece of cloth tied around his neck and every day, he would ecstatically worship them. And now, Hanumanji handed over the same deities to Bhima. So, Bhima received them with great respect and he took those deities. As long as Bhima was present on this earth, Bhima kept those deities very carefully and he would worship them every day. Of course, it is said that today, those deities were further, after the time of the Pandavas, were handed down further to their descendants and eventually, it reached the hands of Madhvacharya and he kept them in the Udupi temple. And it is said that even today, that Udupi temple, there are the deities of Sita and Rama, who are the same deities who were worshipped by Ikshwaku and then, handed over by Rama to his devotee, who handed it over to Hanumanji, who handed it over to Bhima and Bhima handed over to his descendants and finally, it is now in the temple of Udupi.

**Key Quote:** "Then, Hanumanji assured him that because the Pandavas were all devotees of Lord Krishna, he would definitely help them."
**Summary:** Hanuman promises to support the Pandavas, and Bhima returns to Draupadi with the lotuses, while the Pandavas continue their life in exile, moving between different forests.

So, Bhima then, taking the requested Hanumanji, that he should support them in some way, whenever the need would arise, when the Pandavas would have to face the Kauravas in battle. Then, Hanumanji assured him that because the Pandavas were all devotees of Lord Krishna, he would definitely help them and he said he would help them by being personally present on the flag of Arjuna during the battle, which would take place between them and the Kauravas. And then, Bhima left Hanumanji there and he went further and he approached the celestial planets, which was the abode of Kuvera and there he found that lake, where there were many, many golden thousand petal lotuses and he picked a few of them and he brought them back to Draupadi. So, like this, the Pandavas were engaging in various activities during their stay. They were going back and forth between two forests, the Kamyaka forest and the Dwaitavana forest. Dwaitavana forest is said to be modern day Dev Vandh. Dwaitavana was also known as Dev Vandh and now it came to be known as Dev Vandh which is near Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Kamyakavana is said to be a forest which is close to Thar desert. It is further up northwards and the Dwaitavana is down south from Kamyakavana. So, the Pandavas were largely going between these two. Sometimes they would go to the Himalayas and like this they would keep going to various parts of the forest and they would build a hermitage there, live for some time and like this they were going.

**Summary:** The Pandavas' exile nears its end, causing anxiety for Dhritarashtra but increasing Duryodhana's false confidence, leading to a plan to flaunt his opulence before the Pandavas.

The Pandavas were spending their time. Now time went by and slowly the years passed by. One year, two years, three years, four years like this they entered the twelfth year in forest exile. In Hastinapura, Dhritarashtra was counting the days and as the time came closer for the Pandavas forest exile to get over, Dhritarashtra's blood pressure was going up. He was becoming more and more anxious because he knew the Pandavas were righteous and he was also repenting whatever had happened to the Pandavas. So, he knew that unless the Pandavas were given their rightful kingdom eventually there could be war and if war was there then definitely Duryodhana did not stand a chance. Duryodhana on the other hand he was merrily spending his time enjoying life and oblivious of the fact that the forest exile was coming to a close instead of becoming anxious Duryodhana was becoming more and more cocksure of himself because he was building up his alliances and his opulence was increasing his military strength was increasing so he was under the false confidence that his power is increasing while the Pandavas are in exile when they come back who is going to support them so this was Duryodhana's thinking so when the 12th year came then Karna came to Duryodhana and he said long time over we have been enjoying like this and Duryodhana has become very opulent you become very powerful all these things are there and you know by our by our plans by our scheme we managed to keep the Pandavas very far away so but then you know simply enjoying like this is doesn't full maja is not there we should go and show off to the Pandavas you know let us go and show them what we have got and how we are enjoying so you know a little bit let us finger them so Duryodhana heard this and he said ah very good idea let us do that so Duryodhana thought let me let us you know go and show off let me go up and go to the forest and show off my power and my opulence to the Pandavas so he started making arrangements to uh to you know get together a large army thousands of horses thousands of elephants and and we have all the women folk and carrying lot of jewels and ornaments and all that he thought let us go to where the Pandavas are there in Dwaitavana and let us show off what power and opulence I've got like this he started getting ready now when Duryodhana was planning like this to go and and insult the Pandavas and show off his opulence and power what happened please join us in the next episode to learn about this thank you for joining us today Hare Krishna

**Key Quote:** "In this way the Pandavas were going on accumulating pious credits. On the other hand Duryodhana was merely enjoying all the royal opulence and he was not engaged in conducting any fire sacrifice or yajnas."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Pandavas' austere life in exile, focused on spiritual practices, with Duryodhana's opulent lifestyle and envy, setting the stage for Duryodhana's plan to show off his wealth.

Welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode we have seen how the Pandavas, being in the forest exile, were engaged in executing various kinds of austerity. They were living in the forest, sometimes shuttling between Dwaitavana and Kamyakavana. They were living in simple thatched cottages with mud flooring. They were wearing dresses made out of tree bark. And they were constantly engaged in conducting yajna, sacrifices to please Lord Vishnu. And having obtained from the sun god, Suryadeva, a magical pot which could produce unlimited amount of food for feeding the guests. With that Draupadi would everyday cook and feed large number of saintly people who would come and attend the yajnas conducted by Yudhishthir Maharaj. In this way the Pandavas were going on accumulating pious credits. On the other hand Duryodhana was merely enjoying all the royal opulence and he was not engaged in conducting any fire sacrifice or yajnas. He was simply enjoying the power and opulence of the royal household and thus he was using up all his previous pious credits. Two contrasting things we were able to see. And when the Pandavas entered the twelfth year of their forest exile, Duryodhana based on the instigation by Karna decided to go to Dwaitavana to show off his opulence. How much wealth he had acquired and with all the women folk, with all the resources, with some small army with him. He wanted to go there and show off to the Pandavas because look out how I am enjoying life and how you people are suffering. During these twelve years, Duryodhana had spent time not only in increasing the strength of his army but also in striking of alliances with various friendly kings and he was like this building up his army power. So that he knew later when the Pandavas would come to seek their kingdom back, he could very easily rebuff.

**Key Quote:** "Now when Duryodhana heard this proposal from Karna that it is good to go and show up to the Pandavas and rub salt on their wounds, it appealed very much to Duryodhana because we all have seen how Duryodhana is very envious by nature and he liked to insult the Pandavas although there was no fault on their side."
**Summary:** Duryodhana, motivated by envy and instigated by Karna, seeks permission from Dhritarashtra to visit Dwaitavana under the guise of inspecting cows, concealing his true intention to humiliate the Pandavas.

Now when Duryodhana heard this proposal from Karna that it is good to go and show up to the Pandavas and rub salt on their wounds, it appealed very much to Duryodhana because we all have seen how Duryodhana is very envious by nature and he liked to insult the Pandavas although there was no fault on their side. Now for Duryodhana to go to Dwaitavana, an excuse was needed. So he went to his father Dhritarasva and he told him that the time has come to count, to take count of all the cows. And inspect them for their health and well-being whether the caretakers are taking good care of them or not. So I am planning to go with a small retinue, with a small portion, segment of my army I want to take and all the women folk and my wife and all those people I want to take them and go to the place where the cows are currently which happens to be Dwaitavana. Dhritarasva when he heard this, immediately he said, why are you going to Dwaitavana? The Pandavas are already there, if you go there and by chance both of you come to meet each other, I don't want another fight between the two of you. So why you have to go? Send some important minister or general or somebody like that, why do you have to personally go? But then Duryodhana was adamant, he wanted to go himself although he could not openly express it to Dhritarasva. Then Shakuni also supported Duryodhana and told Dhritarasva, why we will go to Dwaitavana? Why? All the Pandavas, they are already in forest exile, they are practically nobody now, why will we go to them? Forget it, we are going for our other purpose, we will keep away from them. So Dhritarasva finally relented and he said, okay, if you want to go, we are very insistent you go but don't trouble the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana with his retinue, he reached Vaithavana and which is said to be modern day Dev Vand in Uttar Pradesh and having reached there, he inspected all the cows, took count of them, asked about the health, he looked up the health records of all the cows and having considered all these things, having finished all his duties."
**Summary:** Duryodhana travels to Dwaitavana with his army and advisors, completing the pretense of inspecting the cows, and then sends scouts to find a suitable location to set up camp near the Pandavas to flaunt his opulence.

Now having got Dhritarasva's permission, Duryodhana took off with his small army, few horses, a few foot soldiers and some chariots like that, few means a few thousand, not that small also. And then Duryodhana was accompanied by Karna, Shakuni and Dushasana and his other brothers who all wanted to see the fun, how the Pandavas are going to be, you know, they are going to be insulted and they are going to be humiliated, that was the, they wanted to join in the fun. So they all went. Duryodhana with his retinue, he reached Vaithavana and which is said to be modern day Dev Vand in Uttar Pradesh and having reached there, he inspected all the cows, took count of them, asked about the health, he looked up the health records of all the cows and having considered all these things, having finished all his duties. Then he went. He sent some people to figure out in the Vaithavana where the Pandavas are and he told his people go and set up camp close to where they are in such a way that they can see us and we will have some revelry and some celebration and we will have some dancing, music and all those kind of things and that will rub the Pandavas this one ego, that was Duryodhana's this one. So the few people, some few soldiers from his army, they went seeking out a place where they could set camp and also in such a way that it would be visible for the Pandavas. The Pandavas at that moment, Yudhishthira Maharaj was engaged in a fire sacrifice, a yajna was going on and he was along with a few other Rishis and Sages and Ramanas who were conducting the fire sacrifice, he was involved in that. The Pandavas of course were totally unaware of Duryodhana's impending visit. So this small group of army was going forward, they came across the place near a lake on the bank of the lake where the Pandavas were being seated.

**Summary:** Gandharvas, sent by Indra due to Duryodhana's malicious intentions, arrive in Dwaitavana and prevent Duryodhana's forces from setting up camp, leading to an impending conflict.

Now in the meantime unknown to both the Pandavas and to Duryodhana what had happened. Some Gandharvas had come there, to that forest. Now these Gandharvas are celestial beings. They are not limited in their travel like we are if we have to go to some planet some other planet outside the earth planet let us say we want to go to the moon or the mars or something like that there are so many restrictions it's not easy to go there for human beings but the gandharvas are not because they are from the upper planets they are not limited in their travel like that they can very easily travel to whichever planet they want and if they so choose they can remain hidden to the view of the human beings or if they want they can reveal themselves also so in this case the gandharvas they stopped the team which duryodhana had sent for and they told them you cannot come to this part of the forest this belongs to us so you please go back so these small team members they because gandharvas they are celestial beings they went back to duryodhana and conveyed to him that like this we were stopped by the gandharvas and they refused to allow us to set camp there now duryodhana being the kind of arrogant person he is he said what gandharvas this is my kingdom i will do whatever i want here i will not listen to any gandharvas and all that then he called all his small army together and he went and he attacked the gandharvas now the gandharvas were very well prepared for this attack from duryodhana because they had come specifically there for that purpose to to engage in a battle with duryodhana now why would they come there to engage in a battle with duryodhana why did the gandharvas have to come down from the celestial planet actually what had happened was when duryodhana had made his plans to go to dvaitavana and to humiliate the pandavas the new dvaitavana had to go to dvaitavana and to humiliate the crakoosrit hindra and hindra was always very favorable to the pandavas especially to arjuna because arjuna was born to kuntidevi from the blessings of hindradeva so in one sense hindra was the father of arjuna so he did not like this activity from this act of duryodhana's where he wanted to humiliate the pandavas Gandharvas and told them, see like this Duryodhana is going to Dwaitavana with an evil intention, you go and take care of him.

**Summary:** A battle ensues between Duryodhana's army and the Gandharvas, resulting in the Kauravas' defeat, the cowardly retreat of Karna, Shakuni, and Dushasana, and Duryodhana's capture.

with their weapons. Now, a fierce battle started with between the small army of Duryodhana along with Karna, Shakuni, Dushasana and others and on the other side, a small group of the Gandharvas. Now, although Karna was a powerful archer, Duryodhana himself was a great warrior. Despite all this, the Gandharvas being celestial beings, gradually they drove back Duryodhana's army. Finally, what happened? Shakuni ran away from the battlefield when he saw that his life was in danger. So also, when Karna saw that his arrows were failing and he too was in a very precarious condition, he along with Dushasana and the other brothers of Duryodhana, they all ran away from the battlefield. Actually, a Kshatriya is never supposed to show his back in a battle. A Kshatriya is supposed to fight till the death. But this cowardly act from the side of Karna and Dushasana and others was not surprising because they were used to very boastful and ostentatious claims, although they did not have the real powers like the Pandavas. That is why they were always envious of the Pandavas because the Pandavas actually, even though they were very humble and very nice people, the Kauravas, Karna and Duryodhana and others knew that the Pandavas were, always far more powerful than them and far more opulent than them. That was why Duryodhana and Karna and others were always envious of the Pandavas. Be that as it may, the whole Kaurava army was defeated, it was routed, practically almost all their army was destroyed, and Karna, Dushasana and others, Shakuni and others, ran away from the battlefield in a cowardly manner. Now, Duryodhana stood fighting there and finally, Duryodhana was captured by the Dandarvas. So, whatever little bit of Duryodhana's army was left, they ran away.

**Summary:** Duryodhana's remaining soldiers seek help from the Pandavas, who, despite knowing Duryodhana's intentions, are bound by their Kshatriya dharma to offer protection.

But still, they were lamenting that our master has been captured, now what to do? So they consulted amongst themselves and they thought it wise to approach the Pandavas and seek their help because they were close at hand to go back to Hastinapura and to call Bhishma Dev and bring him back and Dronacharya and others was practically next to impossible. Something had to be done right there, right then. So this remaining small group of people, the soldiers went and approached Yudhishthir Maharaj who was in the midst of performing the Ejna and they narrated the whole thing before him. Of course, this group of soldiers, they did not know Duryodhana's evil intention, his malified intention in coming there to actually humiliate the Pandavas. They were thinking he came here to count the cows and all those kind of things and after finishing all that, he wanted to just sit, camp there, relax a little bit and go back to Hastinapura. That was their understanding. The moment Pandavas heard that Duryodhana had come there and he had been captured by the Gandharvas, they immediately understood what was the background of this whole incident. And the moment they heard that Duryodhana had been captured, Bhima uttered, Bhishma uttered these words... Bhima said, We would have had to undergo a great effort and endeavor with a great assembly of horses and elephants and chariots and soldiers, in order to get it. There was aור Atharnas when he was one. defeat duryodhana and capture him what we could have achieved with great endeavor the gandharvas have achieved it very easily so bhima was appreciating the gandharvas that what we would have taken great endeavor to do that the gandharvas have done very good we are saved of the great

And gradually, with a heavy heart, they all came back to Hastinapura. Now, Duryodhana, although initially he was very much afflicted by this humiliation at the hands of the Pandavas, gradually, after a little while, he forgot the incident and came back to his normal self. And being the arrogant person he was, he again started, he started plotting how to humiliate the Pandavas. So, it so happened that one great sage happened to come to Hastinapura. And when Duryodhana heard that, about this sage's arrival in Hastinapura, immediately a plan started hatching in his mind. So what was the plan that Duryodhana had newly thought up of? And who was the sage? And what was the role he was going to play in Duryodhana's new plot? Please join us in the next episode of the Mahabharata to learn about this. Thank you for joining us today.

#### Lord Krishna, Yajnas, Demigods

**Key Quote:** "Each of them is not God. They are all demigods. Meaning, they are more powerful than human beings but they are not God himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Lord Krishna's role as the supreme enjoyer of sacrifices and introduces the concept of demigods and their responsibilities.

Before we start that, we have to understand one wonderful quality about Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that Lord Krishna is the supreme Enjoyer of all the fire sacrifices which are mentioned in the Vedas. What are Yajnas? What are these fire sacrifices? As Lord Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita, when the creation happened at the beginning of the creation, Brahmaji created human beings as well as Devatas. Devatas are the demigods and the demigods as we all know, they are said to be 33 crore in number. There is Indra, Chandra, Vayu, Durga, Lord Shiva, Ganesha, etc. So many personalities are there. Who are these Devatas or who are these demigods? Each of them is not God. They are all demigods, meaning they are more powerful than human beings but they are not God himself. They are lower than God but higher than human beings. Therefore, they are called demigods.

**Key Quote:** "So, these demigods are interested with various administrative responsibilities in running this universe."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the demigods' role in administering the universe, drawing an analogy to government departments and their functions.

So, these demigods are interested with various administrative responsibilities in running this universe and there are duties. Knowledge is one of the most important things in running this universe. Chanta has explained how we could keep up with the existence of these elements in each and every present form. So this universe is running in a very systematic manner. Seasons come and go in a particular cycle. The sun rises and sets at specific times in specific directions. Similarly with the moon also. The ocean maintains its limits etc, etc. Like this, if we observe nature, we can see how nature is running things so systematically, the cause of the superintendence of all these Arbeits load sets of all these demigods. Now Brahmaji, when he created all these human beings, also Brahmaji's intention was that these devatas or demigods would administer the universe in such a way that the human beings would be able to lead their lives peacefully, they would be able to have a harmonious life and the human beings would also be able to utilize their human body to understand higher spiritual subject matter and liberate themselves permanently from this material world and go back to Godhead. This is the whole scheme of things. Now this is just like the government is having many many departments, the electricity department, the water department, the drainage department, the roadways department, the public works department, so many departments of the government's new innumerable departments the government has. Now what is the intention of the government creating so many departments and having so many employees and bureaucrats and all that? The idea is to administer the state or the country in a very proper manner so that the citizens can live peacefully, they can execute their activities and they can live harmoniously and they can carry out

**Key Quote:** "The human beings, when they conduct Yajnas, that will be the process by which they will pay their fees to the devatas, to the demigods."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of Yajnas as a way for humans to express gratitude to the demigods, and the consequences of neglecting them.

they can fulfill all their whatever their desires are. This is the intention of the government. Now for the government to be able to do all this, they need money. Where will they get the money from? They tax the citizens. The citizens have to pay income tax, they have to pay GST, they have to pay the electricity bill, they have to pay the water bill. So without the citizens paying the requisite fees, the government cannot function. In a similar way, for the devatas, for the demigods also to administer this universe, they need such a government to be able to do all this so that the certain fees. But what fees they need is not our paper currency. That is of no value to them. In fact, in India, rupee has value. The same rupees, if you go to the US and try to buy anything with that, it will not run. So, even within this earth, the currencies don't run from one country to another. So, how can we expect the devatas to take our money? It will not work. But some way, the human beings have to express their gratitude to the devatas, to the demigods for administering this universe so that everyone can peacefully, harmoniously execute their duties. So, how to do that? That also, Brahmaji, when he created this universe, he said at the beginning of creation that I will also create Yajnas. The human beings, when they conduct Yajnas, that will be the process by which they will pay their fees to the devatas, to the demigods. So, this is the whole arrangement. The human beings, they perform Yajnas, devatas are pleased, they will send ample amount of rain, sunshine and everything will be in proper order. The moment there is any discrepancy in this performance of these Yajnas, there will be natural disturbances. There will be floods, there will be earthquakes, there will be tsunamis, there will be volcanoes, there will be pandemics and such other things

#### Yajnas, Lord Vishnu, Krishna's Supremacy

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "But no matter what Yajna you do for whichever devata it is... the Yajna Pati, the chief person in every Yajna has to be Vishnu."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Lord Vishnu is the chief recipient of all Yajnas and the supreme controller of all universes.

will take over. So, although the Vedas prescribe different Yajnas for different devatas, for Ganesha, there is one type of Yajna, for Lord Shiva, there is another set of Yajnas, for pleasing Lord Surya, the sun god, there are another set of Yajnas. So, there are so many Yajnas, Pratas, etc. described for the different devatas. But no matter what Yajna you do for whichever devata it is, whether it is Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesha, Indra, Vayu, Surya, for whomever you do, the Yajna Pati, the chief person in every Yajna has to be Vishnu. Without that, even the devatas will not accept the offerings given in the Yajnas. So, Krishna has declared in the Bhagavad Gita, He is Sarvaloka Maheshwara. You can imagine, all the Edhnyas that we perform, he is the chief recipient of all the Edhnya offerings. Not only that, Sarva Loka Maheshwaram, he is the supreme controller of all the planets of all the universes. We are living in one universe, but ours is not the only universe. There are millions of universes, unlimited number of universes in the material manifestation. The Lord Vishnu or Krishna is the supreme controller of all of them. So Krishna is such a great personality. Everything belongs to him. All the universes belong to him. Everything that we have in this world belongs to him. All the gold, all the diamond, all the riches, all the natural resources, everything belongs to him. The whole planet itself belongs to him. The entire solar system, the Milky Way Galaxy, everything belongs to Krishna.

#### Krishna's Expectations, Love and Devotion, Simple Offerings
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/aHy5ph1ghOE?t=584
**Verse References:** BG 9.26
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Whatever bhakti upasrutam, whatever with love you give me, I am ready to accept."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna values love and devotion above material possessions, accepting even simple offerings like water, a leaf, a fruit, or a flower.

So Krishna is such a great person. He is such a great personality. But then Krishna, what is he expecting from all of us? Although he is such a great personality, he is not expecting something big from us. Normally if we have to go, if we have an appointment with a big person, let us say we have an appointment with the president of the country and we are going to meet him, then how will we go? We will not go empty handed. We will take some gift or some present for him. Now what will we take as a gift or present? I tell you, you are going to this one. You come and ask me that you have got an appointment with the president of India. So what do you think you should take as a gift for the president? So I respond, why don't you take one bottle of mineral water? What will you say? You laugh at me. What are you talking? I am going to meet the president, not my some chaddi those living next door. Can I take a bottle of water and go to him? That's all. You know, the whole meeting will be a fiasco. Okay. So I have to take something valuable, something which will be of some value to him. So this will be your response. Now imagine you have got an appointment with the Supreme Lord Krishna, who is the proprietor of all the universe, the entire planetary system, everything belongs to him. You are going to meet him. So what gift can you take to him? So Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita what he expects from us. Krishna is ready to give his time to all of us, to meet us, to hear us, to hear all our prayers. Everything, Krishna is ready. So but then when we go to Krishna, we cannot go empty handed. We have to take something. So Krishna is telling in the Bhagavad Gita what all we can give him. Krishna is saying patram pushpam phalam toyam yomye bhaktya prayatchati tadaham bhakti upasrutam asnami prayatatmanah. Krishna says, bhakti upasrutam, whatever with love you give me, I am ready to accept. Okay, what should I offer you with love? You offer me a glass of water, a leaf, a fruit or a flower, I am happy with that. You can see Krishna is pleased even if you offer him one glass of water. Even that Krishna is looking forward. Krishna does not need water. What is? He is the owner of the whole universe. What is the need for him? Even if we take the most precious diamonds and jewels and go to Krishna, it is nothing, it is like garbage for him because everything belongs to him. What can we offer to him? But still Krishna is saying, what I see is your love and affection. So if you give me even a glass of water with love and affection, I will happily accept.

#### Krishna's Love, Duryodhana's Plot, Durvasa Muni

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "So similarly Krishna, we are all Krishna's children. And Krishna is excited. He is happy. He is expecting our love and affection, nothing more, nothing less."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a president and his grandchild to illustrate Krishna's desire for love and affection, then returns to the story of Duryodhana and his plan to use Durvasa Muni against the Pandavas.

Just like if the president were to go to his home and his grandchild comes to him and offers him a glass of water with so much love and affection, so the president will feel very very grateful to his grandchild, oh so nice, my dear child you have brought me a glass of water, we will very happily he will drink the water. Actually president does not need water, what is one glass of water for him? But then when he sees his grandchild giving that glass of water with love and affection, he feels highly satisfied. So similarly Krishna, we are all Krishna's children. And Krishna is excited. He is happy. He is expecting our love and affection, nothing more, nothing less. So this is Krishna's nature, he is very humble and very down to earth and he has very little expectations from us. All that he is looking forward from us is our love and affection, that's all. This is Krishna's nature. So coming back to our original narration. Now it so happened that the sage Krishna, he was very happy. The sage who had come to Hastinapura was none other than the powerful Durvasamuni. Now Durvasamuni, as you all know, his nature is that he is very short tempered. Now the moment Duryodhana heard that Durvasamuni has come to Hastinapura, immediately something clicked in his mind. He thought, ah, now if somehow I can make Durvasamuni go to the Pandavas and the Pandavas are not able to take care of him, then Durvasamuni will definitely get angry and he will curse them. So my military power cannot match the Pandavas' military power, but definitely a Brahmana's power, his power of his austerity, his tapasya, the Pandavas cannot counter. So this will be a good way to take revenge on the Pandavas.

#### Duryodhana's Service, Durvasa Muni's Temperament, Manipulation

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana swallowed all the problems he had to face in front of Durvasamuni and very humbly he served him."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Duryodhana's elaborate and humble service to Durvasa Muni, despite the sage's difficult temperament, all in pursuit of his plan to harm the Pandavas.

So thinking like this, Duryodhana immediately invited Durvasamuni to the palace and Durvasamuni, when he comes, he comes with all his disciples. And now Durvasamuni's disciples are not one or two or three or five or ten, not even hundred, not even a thousand, ten thousand disciples. So you can imagine, Duryodhana had to make all the arrangements to take care of all of them, take care of their accommodation, their food and whatever other requirements are there. And over and above that, Durvasa himself has to be taken care of. So Duryodhana made all the necessary arrangements, made very good preparations. He took care of them and he personally attended to Durvasamuni. And this Durvasamuni was a very difficult customer. Suddenly in the middle of the night, he will wake up and he will say, you know, I want to offer something to my Deity, so my Salagrama, so you please bring varieties of preparation. And immediately the people will run, they will cook something and then after 45 minutes, one hour, they will bring all their offerings. They will, Durvasamuni will say, no, no, I changed my mind. I don't want to offer anything. Take back everything. You know, like that. He was quite a difficult customer like that. So and no matter how much good care would be taken of him, he would find some fault or the other and he would get angry and he would criticize, he would chastise, all these things would go on. But Duryodhana, although he was such an arrogant person, keeping in mind that he had to take the help of Durvasamuni to humiliate his archenemy, the Pandavas, he did not do it. Duryodhana swallowed all the problems he had to face in front of Durvasamuni and very humbly he served him. He took good care of him. No complaints, whatever Durvasamuni demanded, everything he would run around and try to satisfy him in every possible way. This went on for some days. After a few days, then Durvasamuni was very satisfied with the way Duryodhana had served him. Of course, Durvasamuni was a very simple sage. Although he was a very simple sage, he was a little short-tempered, but he was very good at heart and he would very easily get pleased also because Durvasamuni is a partial incarnation of Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva also has this same characteristic, he has the same trait. He gets pleased very quickly and he gets displeased also very quickly. So this Durvasamuni was very pleased with Duryodhana's way of hospitality and without any complaints, without any objections, Duryodhana had served him. So finally, Durvasamuni was very pleased with him and he told Duryodhana, I am very happy with the way you have served me. So I bless you. And like this, he gave his blessings and all that.

**Key Quote:** "I want that you should give your blessings to them also. Give them also an opportunity to serve you."
**Summary:** Duryodhana subtly manipulates Durvasa Muni into visiting the Pandavas in the forest, framing it as an opportunity for them to receive blessings.

Then Duryodhana replied to Durvasamuni. He wanted to manipulate Durvasamuni and, but at the same time, he could not openly do it also because Durvasamuni, after all, he is a good sage. And why would he get angry? He was angry on the Pandavas for no reason. There had to be some reason. So Duryodhana told Durvasamuni that Durvasamuni, I am very happy that you have blessed me. I am very fortunate to have received your, the dust of your feet on my kingdom, in my palace and to have received the opportunity to serve you. Now I have a humble request to you. My brothers, the Pandavas are in the forest. I want that you should give your blessings to them also. Give them also an opportunity to serve you. By this way, let them also get the fortune. Why I should alone be the recipient of the fortune of serving you? They should also get the opportunity. Durvasamuni was very happy when he heard this because the Pandavas are dear to everyone. In fact, another name for Yudhishthira Maharaj was Ajatashatru, meaning one whose enemy had never been born. In other words, he would, by his actions, by his words and by his deeds, he would never create a situation where another person could become inimical towards him. Of course Duryodhana considered the Pandavas and Yudhishthira Maharaj his own enemies. That was because of his envy, not because Yudhishthira Maharaj had mistreated him at any point of time. So naturally because Yudhishthira Maharaj was such a great personality and he was always fixed in virtue, so all the rishis and sages held in this person to be in their arrangements. The Pandavas and Yudhishthira Maharaj always people in virtue. That was the common point that he held on. So, naturally when a person atmospheric, they thought that Yudhishthira Maharaj would be seen him in high esteem. So, Durvasamuni also held him in high esteem. So, now, when he heard from Duryodhana that the Pandavas are there in Dwaitavana and he can go and give them an opportunity to serve him and he can bless them, Durvasamuni was very happy. He said, oh yes, why not, definitely I will go and visit them. Now, Duryodhana started putting

his plan into motion. He said, Durvasamuni, I have heard that Yudhishthir Maharaj is conducting various sacrifices, Ejnas and all that. So, if you go to him during the day time, in the first half of the day, he may be busy in his Ejnas and all that. So, he may not be able to receive you properly and take good care of you. So, after he finishes his Ejna and then he has fed all the people who have come to the Ejna and then all the Pandavas have had their food, then you can go to him. So, he will also be free. He can give you exclusive attention and he will be able to take care of you in a very nice manner. So, when Durvasamuni heard this from Duryodhana, he said, okay, what you are saying also makes sense. If I go with my 10,000 disciples, if I barge into his Ejna, it is not good, it is not correct also. So, after they have had their food and sent away all their other guests, then I will go. I can spend some good time personally also with them. So, I will do as you say. It is a good service. So, this is the suggestion you are given. Poor Durvasamuni, he had fallen into

the trap of Duryodhana unknowingly. Now, Durvasamuni took all his disciples, 10,000 disciples and he proceeded to Dwaitavana and he reached Dwaitavana. When he reached Dwaitavana, he reached at a time after lunch time when the Pandavas had completely finished all their fire sacrifices, all the guests had been fed, they themselves had taken their food. And now, Durvasamuni entered the ashrama, the hermitage where the Pandavas were living and he came and knocked on the door. When he knocked on the door, the Pandavas came. They opened the door and they saw, oh, Durvasamuni has come with all his disciples. They immediately offered their obeisances and welcomed him and Durvasamuni said, oh, my dear Pandavas, I come here. I heard that you are here. So, I come to meet all of you. So, I have come a long distance. I am a little hungry. I will go and take my bath. I will take my bath and come. After that, I will have food at your place. Now the Pandavas said, okay, okay, Durvasamuni, we will wait for you to come back and Bhima took them and showed them a place close by where there was a water body where they could take bath and freshen up. So, Durvasamuni with all his 10,000 disciples went to the water body and they started taking bath. In the meantime, here what was happening? Yudhishthir Maharaj went back into the cottage and told Draupadi, Oh, this Durvasamuni has come with his 10,000 disciples. Now we have to feed him. He is hungry. So please bring out all your pots and from your Akshaya Patra, please start serving him. Because the Akshaya Patra can serve unlimited number of meals. Draupadi stood there stunned. She said, I cannot feed him now. Yudhisthira Maharaj asked her, why? What happened? She said, I already have my food and once I have had my food, the Akshaya Patra will become empty. It is totally empty. Nothing is there here. So can you cook something now for 10,000 people? What? It is not like cooking for one or two people. Even for one or two people, if you have to cook, you need at least half an hour, one hour. And this Durvasamuni will finish all his bath and come back in 10-15 minutes. 10,000 people, where will I cook from? How will I cook? Not possible.

**Key Quote:** "Now the Yudhishthira Maharaj was in great anxiety that now the rules of Dharma will be broken."
**Summary:** The Pandavas are in a state of anxiety, fearing they will break the principles of Dharma by failing to provide hospitality to Durvasa Muni and his disciples, ending on a cliffhanger.

Now what to do? Now the Pandavas were in great anxiety. Now if they don't take care of Durvasamuni, they were not so much worried about his anger. They were more worried that the principles of Dharma will be broken. They would not be able to take care of a guest who had come to their place seeking food. So it is the duty of a Kshatriya and a Grihastha that whoever comes to their house, they should feed them amply. Even if the owner of the house, even if the host says, he has not eaten, even if he goes hungry, he should still take care of feeding the guest. This is the principle of Dharma. Now the Yudhishthira Maharaj was in great anxiety that now the rules of Dharma will be broken. Now what to do? Draupadi is a woman, so she also got into great anxiety. She was not able to tolerate. She started crying. Now what to do? The Pandavas were not able to understand what to do. In the meantime, the Durvasa Muni along with all his 10,000 disciples, they were all taking bath and they had finished their bath and they were about to come out of the water body and dry themselves and wear their cloth. They were on the verge of finishing their bath. So now what could the Pandavas do in this scenario? How could they save themselves from the wrath of Durvasa Muni, which was impending, which it looked like it was a mission impossible to be able to feed. How could the Pandavas save themselves from the wrath of Durvasa Muni with his 10,000 disciples? Now the Pandavas were really stuck. So what could they do now in this situation? Please join us in our next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna. Jagatguru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, setting the stage for the current narrative about Durvasa Muni's visit and the Pandavas' predicament.

Hare Krishna and a warm welcome to all of you to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode, we have seen how Durvasamuni had come to the hermitage of the Pandavas with his 10,000 disciples at a time when Draupadi had finished her meal. And Durvasamuni came there at that time specifically because Duryodhana had manipulated him into thinking that that would be the right time to come to the Pandavas, when they would be free enough to receive him and his disciples well. Durvasamuni's intentions were not bad, but he had been manipulated by Duryodhana, unaware of Duryodhana's nefarious design. And when Durvasamuni came, he requested Yudhishthira Maharaj to keep lunch ready for all of them and that they would finish their noon bath and come back. And they went to the place, to a water body nearby where they could take bath. In the meantime, we saw how Draupadi and the Pandavas were all very anxious about what they could do now because to cook for 10,000 people in a matter of few minutes was practically impossible. So what did the Pandavas do? What happened to them? Would Durvasamuni's ire vent itself upon them?

#### Krishna, Narada Muni, Dwaraka, Opulence, Manifestation

**Key Quote:** "Like this narada mani went from palace to palace in every palace he saw krishna was personally present and engaged in some activity or the other"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates an incident in Dwaraka where Narada Muni witnesses Krishna's simultaneous presence in multiple palaces, highlighting Krishna's supreme nature.

We will begin today's episode with a small incident which happened in Dwaraka. Once Naradamuni, wishing to have darshan of Lord Krishna, because Naradamuni is a great devotee of Lord Krishna, he came to Dwaraka. Now when he came to Dwaraka, he saw that Dwaraka city was very opulent. And he found that there were 16,108 palaces, which Krishna had built for his queens, who also equally were equal in number to the palaces. Naradamuni thought, where will I find Krishna? So he randomly entered into one of the palaces. When he entered into the palace, Krishna was with one of his queens, playing with his children and Krishna very warmly welcomed Naradamuni, asked him about his well-being, etc. And then Naradamuni convinced Krishna to come to Dwaraka, to the palace and see what's happening there because Krishna is having 16,108. How is he managing all of them? We know how in this world today for one man is to manage one wife, he is, you know, his whole world will turn upside down. Now imagine not one, Krishna has sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives to manage. So Narada Muni, being curious to know about this, he entered into another palace. There he saw Krishna was engaged in conducting some fire sacrifice, just like the yajnas are compulsory for every grahastha to be performed in the Vedic varnasama system. So because while walking, while drinking water, while breathing, while doing all these activities, we unknowingly commit sinful activities by stepping upon insects like ants, etc., and we cause deaths to them which actually accrue sinful reactions to us. Not only that, in the course of our earning our wealth, there will be some lies that we may have to speak, or they may be harmless lies, just like you go to a nearby kirana shop to buy your groceries and when you go there you ask him, ask the dhukandar, the owner of the shop, you ask him what is the cost of the dal. He will tell you the dal is 95 rupees per kg. You will say why it is so high. Then he will say no, for you at cost price I will give you 93 rupees. So you will also feel very happy, okay, two rupees discount and you will buy it. But you also know, shopkeeper also knows he cannot give it at cost price. If he starts selling his boots at cost price then he will heavily manage his family. So to just to give you a mental satisfaction he says for you I'm giving it at cost price. So this is a harmless life, but nevertheless it is still alive. Like this in earning our wealth we sometimes have to partake of sinful means to earn our livelihood. So in this many many ways we keep committing sins inadvertently although we may never intend to commit any sinful act. Therefore the Veda state every grahastha has to perform yajna to free himself of his of the sinful reactions which are accruing to him. Not only he has to do dana and he has to do tapasya, meaning he has to engage in fire sacrifice to please Lord Vishnu, he has to engage in activities of charity and he has to undertake some vrata, some austerities. These are compulsory for everyone. Charity was an obligation, it was not a choice. So Krishna, when Narada Muni came to this particular palace of Krishna, Krishna was engaged in doing some yajna. So then Narada Muni left that palace and entered another palace and there he saw Krishna was giving away cows in charity to some qualified brahmanas and he went to another palace. There he saw Krishna was engaged in advising his sons about the duality of this material nature and how we have to progress spiritually. Like this Narada Muni went from palace to palace. In every palace he saw Krishna was personally present and engaged in some activity or the other. So when Narada Muni saw this he was astounded. He was astounded because Krishna was personally present in each of those palaces individually. These were not illusory forms, they were Krishna himself.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's unique ability to be present in multiple places simultaneously, emphasizing his supremacy and transcendence of limitations.

We limited conditioned souls, we can be present in one location at one time. We cannot be in two places at the same time. But Krishna can be present in multiple places at the same time and still he remains the individual that he is. All of these 16,108 Krishnas who were there in each of those palaces, they were not illusory forms, they were not magical forms, they were actually Krishna himself. So this incident demonstrates the supremacy of Krishna, that Krishna is not an ordinary person.

**Key Quote:** "That Krishna who was in Dwaraka with Rukmini Devi, he heard Draupadi's prayer and he immediately rushed out of his room"
**Summary:** The speaker transitions back to the Pandavas' story, describing how Draupadi's desperate prayer to Krishna in the forest prompts Krishna to immediately appear and offer assistance.

So Krishna once, he was in one of his palaces with Rukmini Devi. Rukmini Devi is the principal queen of Krishna. So he was there. He was in his personal room and he was resting on his bed along with Rukmini Devi. Suddenly, at that moment, Krishna got up and he rushed out of the room. Why did Krishna rush out of the room? Because what had happened at that moment, the Pandavas who were there in the forest, when they saw that they were in great danger of transgressing Dharma by not being able to feed Durvasamuni who had come to their hermitage seeking some food, Draupadi, not knowing what to do, she started calling out to Krishna. Krishna, Govinda, what to do? You only have to, you are my only protector. You only have to protect me. Now this prayer of Draupadi, she submitted her prayer with so much surrender and dependence on Krishna, that Krishna who was in Dwaraka with Rukmini Devi, he heard Draupadi's prayer and he immediately rushed out of his room and although he was in Dwaraka, Gujarat, and the Pandavas were in somewhere near Uttar Pradesh, but still Krishna, within a few seconds, he appeared at the hermitage of the Pandavas. And then Krishna came and knocked on the door. And then the Pandavas came and they opened the door and they saw, oh, Krishna is here. And they immediately welcomed Krishna because Krishna is their dear friend. So they immediately welcomed him, brought him into the room and now their anxiety doubled because until now there was only one guest to deal with, Durvasamuni and his 10,000 disciples. Now Krishna himself has come. So immediately the Pandavas made him sit comfortably and then Krishna said, Yes, Draupadi, you called me. That's why I came. Then Draupadi narrated to him what all had happened and like this Durvasamuni was waiting for his food and she had already had her food. So the Akshaya Patra which could produce unlimited food was now empty.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna becomes completely satisfied when his devotee offers him something with love and affection."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Krishna, despite the dire situation, asks for food and is satisfied by the small offering of leftover sabji from Draupadi, emphasizing the importance of devotion over material offerings.

Now Krishna said, Okay, we'll think about that later. We'll figure out some solution. I'm very hungry. I came all the way from Dwaraka. I've come a long way. I'm very hungry. Give me something to eat first. You know, in an empty stomach your mind doesn't work. So Krishna said, First you bring me something to eat. Then we'll think of some solution. So Draupadi immediately rushed back to the kitchen and then she started searching. Oh, Krishna is hungry. She forgot about Durvasamuni, 10,000 disciples, all that because Krishna was their Supreme Lord, her most lovable object. Krishna being the Supreme Lord is the most lovable object for all living entities. So Draupadi thought, you know, she went into greater anxiety. Oh, Krishna is hungry. I have to feed him something. Then she searched around. Nothing was there. And she came back to the room with an empty pot, her eyes full of tears. Krishna, what to do? You're hungry. See, all the pots are empty. There is nothing. She was totally, she was very, very sad and disappointed that she could not feed Krishna. Krishna is hungry and not able to feed him. Then Krishna said, something will be there in the pot you have served. Something may be there. Then Draupadi again looked into the pot very carefully and she found little sabji was sticking in the pot. She wiped the bottom of the pot and took out and said, Krishna, this is all that is there. I am so sorry. This is all that I can offer you. With so much affection, with so much love, Draupadi offered it to Krishna. And like we saw in the last session, what does Krishna expect from us? Even one glass of water, if it is offered with love, Krishna is ready to offer. On the other hand, if we offer the most valuable thing, the most precious jewel and all the wealth in the world, if we are offered the lotus feet of Krishna without any love for him, Krishna is not interested. So when Draupadi gave with so much love and affection, Krishna immediately took that little sabji which was left over and he tasted it and said, he tasted it and he ate it. So like Krishna said, like we discussed in the last episode also, Krishna becomes completely satisfied when his devotee offers him something with love and affection. So although it was a very small quantity of sabji that was there, because Draupadi offered it with full love and affection and surrender, Krishna ate that and he felt completely satisfied. He is satisfied not by the food, but by the devotion with which it is offered.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna rescued the Pandavas from the danger of of Durvasamuni's anger and curse"
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Krishna instructs Sahadeva to call Durvasa Muni, and miraculously, Durvasa and his disciples suddenly feel full and decide to leave, relieving the Pandavas from a potentially disastrous situation.

Krishna said, I am so satisfied with the food that you have given me. So now the Pandavas were happy that Krishna is satisfied, at least we managed to satisfy Krishna. But then, the Durvasamuni's anxiety came back to them. And this Durvasamuni, how to feed Durvasamuni and his 10,000 disciples, that anxiety again was haunting them. So then the Pandavas said, now Krishna, you only have to rescue us, please tell us what to do. Then Krishna told Sahadeva, okay, you go and call Durvasamuni. The Pandavas were looking at each other and said, calling Durvasamuni, what will we do, call him and do? We have got nothing here. So Krishna said, no, don't worry, go and call him, no, let him come, after that we will deal with him, I will tell you what to do. Okay, Sahadeva said, and he went to the edge of the place, where the water body was, he did not want to immediately go and interrupt, all Durvasamuni's disciples, they would all be taking bath, he did not want to interrupt in their privacy, so he stepped a little, a little distance away, and he called out, oh Durvasamuni, we are waiting for you, please come for your lunch, to Yudhishthira Maharaj's hermitage. Now Durvasamuni and his disciples, they got out of the water, they had finished their bath, and they had cleaned themselves, and they were putting on their clothes, when they heard this call, then they started looking at each other's face, one of the disciples walked up to Durvasamuni, and he told him, Durvasamuni, my stomach is feeling very full, I am not hungry, so if I come with all of you, and all of you are eating, and I don't eat, it looks very bad, so all of you come, I will not come, then one by one, all the other disciples also started joining, that, no, no, no, I also don't want to come, my stomach is also full, my stomach is also full, basically every one of them, their stomach is full, none of them want to go, then Durvasamuni looked at them, and he was saying, I am also, my stomach is also full, I also don't feel like going, now we told Yudhishthir Maharaj, that we all have come, prepare the food, now he is calling us for food, and if we go there, and none of us eat something, nothing, if we don't eat anything, what will be, it will be a great insult to them, and God alone knows what will happen, we will have to face their anger on the earth, and who is going to face Bhima, if he gets angry, so what should we do, so they were looking at each other, then they all consulted amongst themselves, and they decided now, if we go back to the Pandavas hermitage, we will have to, it will be very embarrassing, we will go there, and we will say, we told you to prepare food, but now we are not interested in taking, it looked very bad, it will be very humiliating, very embarrassing, and this is the forest, all sages are there, news will spread, and people will start making fun of us, so, what to do now, better we silently go away from here, so they immediately picked up all their clothes, and whatever little belongings they had, they were all sages, and engaged in various austerities, so they did not have much belongings, so they picked up whatever they had, silently, they ran away from the place.

**Key Quote:** "What exactly caused the Durvasamuni and his disciples to lose their hunger"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes the episode by highlighting the mysterious nature of Durvasa Muni and his disciples suddenly losing their hunger after bathing, setting up the next episode to explore the reason behind this event.

Now Sahadeva is calling, calling, no reply is coming, so he thought, let me see what happened, and he goes and sees there, nothing is there, and he could see that, all the disciples had come there, and they had taken their bath, and all that, and he is looking here and there, and nobody, he could not find even one soul, so Sahadeva went back to the hermitage, and he told all the Pandavas, I went there to the water body, I am searching for Durvasamuni and his disciples, not able to find them anywhere, so then Krishna started smiling, and he said, okay, Durvasamuni must have left, maybe he had some other work, so the Pandavas started talking to him, and said, oh, maybe, Durvasamuni, you know, he keeps changing his decisions very frequently, not very stable in his decisions, suddenly he must have remembered some other work, and he must have gone away, anyway, what a relief for us, we were saved from the great disaster of inviting a sage, and not feeding him properly, and so like this, Krishna rescued the Pandavas from the danger of Durvasamuni's anger and curse. So, now the interesting point is, that, why did Durvasamuni and his 10,000 disciples, who were actually hungry when they came to the hermitage, after taking their bath in that water body, why did they feel that their stomachs were full, because normally, in our experience, if we are hungry, and if we take a bath, our hunger will increase, our appetite will increase, in fact, if we are not feeling so hungry, also, we take a bath, our appetite will increase, and if you go and take bath in a water body, like a river, or stream, or something like that, fresh water body, your appetite will increase even more. So, in the case of Durvasamuni and his disciples, when they went and took bath, they should have, their hunger should have increased, the intensity of their hunger should have increased, but we saw, the rewards happened, and it's not that it happened with one or two people, all the 10,000 people, all the 10,000 of them, including Durvasamuni, felt the same thing. So, what could be the reason for this? This is not an ordinary incident, there is something really mysterious behind this. So, what exactly caused Durvasamuni and his disciples to lose their hunger, please join us in our next episode.

**Key Quote:** "being captivated by the beauty of Draupadi, he tried to forcibly abduct her while the Pandavas were not there in the forest at that time."
**Summary:** Recap of Jaidratha's abduction of Draupadi and the Pandavas' absence.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to today's episode of the Mahabharata. Last time we have seen how the ruler of Sindhu, the Sindhu Raja, Jaidratha, who was also known as Saindava, was the husband of Dushyala, the youngest sister of Mahabharata. He came across, he happened to be going to the kingdom of Shalva for an alliance, for a marriage and along the way he happened to pass through the forest where the Pandavas were staying and being captivated by the beauty of Draupadi, he tried to forcibly abduct her while the Pandavas were not there in the forest at that time. Now what happened to Draupadi? When Jaidratha came to their hermitage and he abducted Draupadi, the Pandavas were in the forest. They were not in the hermitage at that point of time. When the Pandavas returned to the hermitage, they found the maidservant of Draupadi, Dhatraika, lying on the floor and weeping inconsolably. The Pandavas quickly approached her and they understood that something was amiss. And when they looked around, they could not find Draupadi also. Then this maidservant, Dhatraika, informed the Pandavas how the king Jaidratha had come there, and against her wishes, Draupadi was forcibly abducted by Jaidratha. Dhatraika also informed the Pandavas the direction in which Jaidratha, along with his retinue of the few soldiers, of that small bit of army that he had brought along with him, which direction they had gone into.

**Key Quote:** "Get ready to face your death."
**Summary:** The Pandavas pursue Jaidratha, who arrogantly underestimates their power.

That was also pointed out by Dhatraika. Immediately, the Pandavas, they had their chariots and their horses and all that. They immediately set out in pursuit of Jaidratha. While pursuing Jaidratha, after a little while, they came across Dhaumya Rishi. This Dhaumya, he was the family priest of the Pandavas. And he also happened to be near the hermitage of the Pandavas, when Jaidratha had abducted Draupadi. And when Dhaumya saw Jaidratha kidnapping Draupadi, he vehemently protested, and he beseeched Jaidratha not to do such an evil thing and to set Draupadi free. But this Jaidratha was an evil person. He did not heed anything of what Dhaumya said. After following Jaidratha for some distance and trying to convince him to release Draupadi, when Dhaumya saw that it was not possible for him, that Jaidratha was not listening, so he was left behind by Jaidratha and he had gone forward. So this Dhaumya Rishi again related to the Pandavas what had happened and how he was also a witness to Jaidratha forcibly abducting Draupadi and how he had tried his best to stop Jaidratha but he would not listen to him. And Dhaumya again showed the Pandavas in which direction Jaidratha had gone. So now the Pandavas very quickly pursued the direction in which Jaidratha had gone and very soon they caught up with him. And Jaidratha could see from the distance the Pandavas coming forward. So Jaidratha asked Draupadi that who are these people who are coming? And Draupadi replied that these people are my five husbands, the Pandavas, whom even the Devatas cannot face in battle. Get ready to face your death. So Jaidratha said, after all five of them, I got an army of a few thousand people with me, what they will be able to withstand? Let us see. One hand I will also see. Let us see. And Jaidratha was also very arrogant and he thought, you know, I will see what these people can do.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, do not kill him. Do not take his life. Only teach him a lesson. That's good enough."
**Summary:** The Pandavas defeat Jaidratha's army, and Yudhishthira instructs them not to kill him because he is married to their sister.

And quickly when the Pandavas came, Jaidratha sent forth his army and the army of Jaidratha fell upon the Pandavas. A few thousand soldiers on one side and only the five Pandavas on the other. But the Pandavas were no ordinary people. Each of them was capable of fighting thousands of soldiers single-handedly. And so Yudhishthira Maharaj, he killed a few of the few hundred soldiers. Bhima killed a few other hundred soldiers. Arjuna also took care of a few hundred of them, Nakula also, Sahadeva also. And very quickly, in no time, Jaidratha saw that his whole army was completely vanquished. There was hardly anything left. And whatever little few people were surviving, they all ran away. And now Jaidratha is all alone. So Jaidratha realized, I had underestimated the strength of the Pandavas. So he thought, now, you know, Jaidratha, although he had on the spur of the moment, he had abducted Draupadi thinking that the Pandavas would be no match for him, at heart, actually, he was a very big coward. So when he saw that his whole army was finished, and he was all alone standing in front of these five Pandava brothers, he left Draupadi there, and he quickly took his chariot and started, you know, fleeing from the spot. So the Pandavas, now that they had dispersed the entire army, they quickly caught up with Draupadi. And the Pandavas inquired whether she was all right. And then Bhima and Arjuna told Yudhishthir Maharaj, that Maharaj, you please take Draupadi back safely to the hermitage. Nakula and Sahadeva will accompany you. We both will see to this Jaidratha. So then Yudhishthir Maharaj said, okay, I will take Draupadi with me. And then Yudhishthir Maharaj told Bhima, but please be careful. He is the husband of our sister Dushala. Therefore, do not kill him. Do not take his life. Only teach him a lesson. That's good enough.

**Key Quote:** "For a Kshatriya to set his eyes upon a married woman was a strict no-no. It was a forbidden thing."
**Summary:** Discussion of Kshatriya dharma, highlighting Jaidratha's cowardice and violation of ethical codes by abducting a married woman.

So Arjuna and Bhima continued in pursuit of Jaidratha. And Yudhishthira, Nakula, Sahadeva along with Draupadi, they returned to the hermitage. Now by the time the Pandavas had got back Draupadi, inquired about her welfare and sent her back along with Yudhishthira, Nakula and Sahadeva to the hermitage, by then, at great speed, Jaidratha had already crossed couple of miles beyond the Pandavas. So Jaidratha had got a head start. Now how to catch up with him? So Arjuna sent forth a few arrows in the direction where Jaidratha had gone. And those arrows quickly covered all the couple of miles which Jaidratha had already passed by and they went and killed Jaidratha's horses. So now Jaidratha was left without a chariot, so he started running away on foot. So when he was running on foot, Arjuna and Bhima on their chariots very quickly caught up with Jaidratha. And so they saw Jaidratha is running away. And behind him, Arjuna and Bhima are coming. And Bhima started calling out, Hey Jaidratha, where are you running? Stop! Wait! Stand there and fight with us! Jaidratha was in no mood to turn around. He simply kept running. Actually a Kshatriya is never supposed to run away from battle. And especially when he is challenged, he cannot turn away like that. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, the character, real character of a real Kshatriya is Yuddhe Chaapalaayanam. In a battlefield, even if he is facing death, the Kshatriya, the true Kshatriya will never turn back. But Jaidratha was a Kshatriya in name only. He was actually a big coward. He was not qualified to be a Kshatriya. Kshatriya, the meaning of the word Kshatriya is one who protects his citizens from any kind of harm. He is called a Kshatriya. It was the duty of the Kshatriya to protect the citizens, bodily also and their honor also. A Kshatriya is always supposed to give special protection. Although generally the Kshatriya is supposed to give protection to the citizens, the Kshatriya has to give special protection to the children, to the women and to the elderly people and to the cows. These four were required to be given special protection by the Kshatriyas. Kshatriyas would sometimes abduct some girls with the intention of marrying them. But such girls would be unmarried girls and the intention in abducting them would be to marry them, not with any other evil intention. For a Kshatriya to set his eyes upon a married woman was a strict no-no. It was a forbidden thing. A Kshatriya could abduct an unmarried girl and marry her, but he could never set his eyes upon a woman he was already married. Draupadi was a well-married woman. She had children of her own. And Jayadratha was knowing this very well. And even though she expressed that she had no interest in Jayadratha, still Jayadratha abducted her. So this is completely against the codes of Kshatriya Dharma.

**Key Quote:** "By abducting Draupadi, Jayadratha had become an Atatain, an aggressor."
**Summary:** Jaidratha is labeled an 'Atatain' (aggressor), and Bhima's anger is discussed, along with Arjuna's intervention to prevent him from killing Jaidratha.

Now this Jayadratha, actually by trying to abduct the Pandavas wife, he had become an Atatain. In the Vedic terminology, there are kinds of Atatains or aggressors. A person who encroaches upon one's property, a person who administers poison, a person who abducts one's wife, a person who suddenly attacks one with deadly weapons without any prior notice. So all these kind of people are called Atatains or aggressors. And in the Vedas it is said that if somebody is an aggressor, is identified as an Atatain, then the person, the victim who is there, if he kills that Atatain, that aggressor, then there is no sin incurred in that. Even in the modern days we can say, we can see that the law will take a very lenient view if a man kills another man in self-defense. This is somewhat similar to that. But of course the Vedas were very specific and they had delineated the seven kinds of people in killing whom nobody could incur a sin and the king also could not punish such people. By abducting Draupadi, Jayadratha had become an Atatain, an aggressor. And according to the codes of Dharma, he was liable to be killed. So now Arjuna and Bhima, when they saw that Jayadratha is not turning around and he is not standing there for a battle, they pursued him and finally very quickly caught up with him. And when they caught up with him, Jayadratha was in no mood to fight. He was already shaking. All his limbs, his whole body was shivering. But then Bhima was very angry. He had to vent his anger. So he started knocking around Jayadratha like he was some piece of doll. So he started punching him, he started kicking him and after some time this Jayadratha, just by Bhima's use of fists and his knees, Jayadratha practically was almost dead. Then Arjuna quickly reminded Bhima, Bhima, please remember Yudhishthira Maharaj has told us not to kill him. He is after all the husband of our sister Dushyala. She should not become a widow. So please don't kill him. Bhima was reminded by Arjuna and then finally he pulled himself back. Bhima's anger was so much that he would not have stopped himself. But somehow Arjuna managed to remind Bhima and then Bhima also controlled,

**Summary:** Bhima humiliates Jaidratha by shaving his head, and Jaidratha is forced to accept subordination to Yudhishthira, but secretly plans revenge through austerities.

he restrained himself. And then now you know Bhima's anger somehow he tried to come out. So what he did, he shaved off the head of Jayadratha except for a few clumps of hair here and there, which is a symbolic way of telling the world that this Kshatriya has been captured and humiliated by another Kshatriya. And then Arjuna and Bhima told him, that we are going to spare your life provided you accept that from today you are a subordinate prince to Yudhishthira Maharaj and that you will always obey his commands. Jayadratha had no other alternative. Either he had to lose his life or he had to agree. Jayadratha being the coward he was, he was in no mood to oppose whatever was being said to him. So he decided to kill him. Jayadratha had no other alternative. Either he had to lose his life or he had to oppose whatever was being said. He readily agreed. Then Bhima and Arjuna caught him, caught Jayadratha, took him back to the hermitage and presented him before Yudhishthira Maharaj and Draupadi. And there Jayadratha fell at the feet of Yudhishthira Maharaj and Draupadi, begged forgiveness from them and accepted to be a subordinate king to the Pandavas and he would always obey their command. Like this he accepted. Yudhishthira Maharaj being the very generous and noble person he was, very quickly he forgave Jayadratha and he advised him, please do not do such things. This does not behove you as a king. As a king you should behave in more noble ways and you should protect the citizens. You should not do such things. Like that in many ways nicely Yudhishthira Maharaj advised Jayadratha on the principles of Dharma and Draupadi also forgave him. Okay, some mistake he did. Anyway, after all he is Dushala's husband so she also forgave him. And then the Pandavas released Jayadratha. Now Jayadratha slowly trudged back and as he was going back the humiliation he had suffered he was not able to digest it. Although in front of the Pandavas he had accepted that he was not, he would be subordinate to the Pandavas and he would obey their commands, at heart he had other plans. He wanted to take revenge. Now how to take revenge? Jayadratha was a very, he was a weakling in front of the Pandavas. So what to do now? So he thought the only way is that I have to perform some tapasya, some austerities and I have to please Mahadeva, Lord Shiva and get a benediction from him that I will be able to kill the Pandavas.

**Summary:** Jaidratha performs tapasya to please Lord Shiva and seek a boon to defeat the Pandavas, setting the stage for the next episode.

Thinking like this, Jayadratha walked and went all the way to Gangotri. He went to Gangotri which is in Uttarakhand and which is in the Himalayas and which is, it is quite a arduous climb to reach to Gangotri. So he went all the way to Gangotri and there he meditated and did tapasya for a long period of time. And after some time Lord Shiva being pleased with his tapasya appeared before Jayadratha. Lord Shiva is Ashutoshya. He is very quickly pleased by people's austerities and Lord Shiva very quickly gives blessings and benedictions to his devotees. Lord Shiva does not think that his benedictions, whether they are harmful or they are for the good of the people. Whatever the people ask, Lord Shiva very quickly and very generously he gives. That's the nature of Lord Shiva. So Jayadratha by his tapasya he managed to please Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva appeared before Jayadratha. And he asked the Jayadratha that O Jayadratha I am pleased with your tapasya. It looks like you are expecting some boon from me. So please ask what you want to. So then Jayadratha folded his hands before Lord Shiva and he said my request is that please grant me a boon that one day I will be able to kill all the five Pandavas in battle. Now when Jayadratha made this request before Lord Shiva, what was Lord Shiva's response? Please join us in our next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today.

**Summary:** The lecture begins with a recap of the previous episode, focusing on Jayadratha's boon from Lord Shiva and the Pandavas' search for firewood leading to Nakula being sent to fetch water.

Hare Krishna, welcome back to all of you to today's episode. In the last episode, we have seen how Jayadratha managed to pacify or please, appease Lord Shiva, and he requested from him a benediction by which he could face all the five Pandavas in battle and vanquish them, which Lord Shiva said is beyond his powers because all the Pandavas were under the direct protection of Lord Krishna, who was the master of Lord Shiva himself. And therefore, Lord Shiva said, the maximum boon that I can grant you is that you can once hold the four Pandavas other than Arjuna at bay only one time in battle. And even that much was enough for Jayadratha, and very satisfyingly, he went back to his kingdom awaiting the day when he would get an opportunity to face the Pandavas in battle and defeat them. In the meantime, we have seen how the Pandavas in search of the firewood which was stolen by a deer went into the forest, and even after pursuing the deer for a long period of time, they could not capture the deer, and being very much aggrieved that they could not recover those Arani firewood sticks which were meant for sacrifice by the sage who was living in the forest, they sat down exhausted in one place in the forest, and Nakula was sent to fetch some water. But when he did not return after a reasonable amount of time, Yudhisthira Maharaj requested Sahadeva to go.

**Key Quote:** "Now Yudhisthira Maharaj was really alarmed. What could have gone wrong? It was highly unthinkable that anything, that any enemy could have attacked and captured Bhima and Arjuna."
**Summary:** The narrative progresses with the successive disappearances of Sahadeva, Arjuna, and Bhima, causing increasing alarm to Yudhisthira, who then decides to investigate himself.

After Sahadeva went, the remaining three Pandavas, they were waiting, and a few minutes elapsed and there was no sign of even Sahadeva. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj started becoming a little worried. Nakula did not come back initially. They were not so worried. They thought maybe he got engrossed in something, forgot to come back or something like that. But when Sahadeva also did not return, Yudhisthira Maharaj was a little worried and he told Arjuna that you please go and see what has happened. Why the two brothers have not returned? Arjuna immediately took his bow just to be well armed in case of any eventuality, and then he went in the direction where Nakula and Sahadeva had gone into the forest in search of water. Yudhisthira and Bhima were waiting, and after a few minutes elapsed, even Arjuna did not return and there was no sign of any signal from him. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj was getting really worried. He told Bhima that I am getting alarmed. Arjuna is such a mighty warrior. Nobody can stand in front of him in battle. Not even the Gandharvas. Not even the Devatas. And it is surprising that Arjuna has not returned. Better you go and see what has happened. Bhima immediately took up his Ghada and he also pursued the three brothers who had gone earlier, Nakula, Sahadeva, as well as Arjuna. And Yudhisthira Maharaj was waiting. Few minutes went by. Now even Bhima has not returned. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj was really alarmed. What could have gone wrong? It was highly unthinkable that anything, that any enemy could have attacked and captured Bhima and Arjuna. It was next to impossible. But something undesirable had happened. This much Yudhisthira Maharaj could be why.

**Summary:** Yudhisthira discovers his brothers lying motionless near a beautiful lake, with no signs of battle or injury, deepening the mystery surrounding their condition.

Therefore he himself set out on foot in the direction in which the rest of his four brothers had gone. After walking a short while in the forest, Yudhisthira Maharaj came across a clearing. And then he saw a little in the distance a beautiful lake with pristine water and filled with lotuses. And there were so many birds surrounding it. There were swans swimming in it. It was a very scenic picture that he was seeing in front of him. And Yudhisthira Maharaj looked around. He could not find anybody. So he went closer to the lake. And when he approached closer to the lake, he suddenly saw on the ground his four brothers lying still, motionless. Yudhisthira Maharaj became very alarmed. And he ran towards the brothers. And he started shaking them, trying to wake them up. All of them were lying motionless with their eyes closed. Practically when Yudhisthira Maharaj tried waking them and tried shaking them and all that, he realized that they were not even breathing. Practically they were dead. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj, then he became very much surprised and astonished that who could have killed his brothers? That too Arjuna and Bhima? Impossible! He looked around and he did not find any signs of any battle, any mud getting, the earth all around being scattered or any such sort of disturbance to the trees or anything like that. Any weapons lying around, arrows lying around here and there. Nothing. He did not find anything. Everything was proper in its place. This made it more surprising. If some enemy had attacked and killed the Pandavas, there should have been some scuffle, some battle. It would have resulted in some destroying some of the foliage. Some weapons would have been lying around. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. And there were no marks of injury on any of the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "Yudhisthira Maharaj, I am the owner of this lake. Please do not drink the water of this lake without my permission. If you want to drink the water from this lake, you have to answer my questions."
**Summary:** As Yudhisthira approaches the lake to quench his thirst, he hears a disembodied voice warning him not to drink the water without answering questions, revealing the lake's owner and the fate of his brothers.

This was a real mystery. Yudhisthira Maharaj quickly got up and started looking around. Who could have done this? But he did not find anybody. Now what to do? He was being afflicted by thirst also. So Yudhisthira Maharaj thought, let me drink the water of this lake, refresh myself and then let me investigate what has gone on here. And thinking like this, Yudhisthira Maharaj approached the lake. The moment he was about to take the water and drink, he heard a voice, a disembodied voice. Disembodied because he could not see from where this voice is coming. And this voice, a deep resonant voice, informed Yudhisthira Maharaj. Yudhisthira Maharaj, I am the owner of this lake. Please do not drink the water of this lake without my permission. If you want to drink the water from this lake, you have to answer my questions. If you try to drink the water of this lake without answering my questions, then you will fall dead just like your brothers. I warned all your brothers not to drink the water without answering my questions. But they did not bother. They went ahead and drank the water without answering my questions. And now you look at their face. They have all fallen dead. If you really want to drink the water, please heed my advice, answer my questions. And if you are able to answer my questions correctly, I will grant your permission. Only then you can drink the water. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj looked around and he said, Who are you? How are you able to wield so much power that you are able to kill my brothers? How do I know who you are?

**Summary:** The voice reveals itself to be a Yaksha, a powerful being, who has taken the form of a bird, and Yudhisthira prepares to answer his questions.

Then Yudhisthira Maharaj saw on the banks of that lake, one bird standing there, a crane or some other bird like that. And the crane and that bird said, I am the person who is the owner of this lake. Yudhisthira Maharaj looked disbelievingly at that bird. And he said, I don't believe you are capable of doing this to my brothers. It's impossible. Please reveal yourself. Who are you? Then the bird replied to him, I am an Yaksha. And as a Yaksha, I have taken this form of the bird. So Yakshas are actually living beings who live on higher planets and who are very, very powerful. They are, normally the Yakshas are followers of Kubera. They are far more powerful than the human beings. Now, Yudhisthira Maharaj, understanding that this is a Yaksha, he realized Yakshas can possess superhuman powers. Maybe the Yaksha has really got some fantastic power by which he is able to kill my brothers. Then Yudhisthira Maharaj said, Okay, go ahead. Ask your questions. I am ready to answer them.

**Key Quote:** "What can be more surprising than this? Than the fact that, day after day, living entities are dying, going to the abode of Yamaraj."
**Summary:** The Yaksha begins questioning Yudhisthira on various aspects of Dharma, and Yudhisthira answers satisfactorily, including the most surprising thing in the world: people's illusion of immortality despite witnessing death daily.

Then the Yaksha started asking Yudhisthira Maharaj varieties of questions. Questions on Dharma, questions on virtuosity, righteousness, about the duties of Kshatriyas and all kinds of questions the Yaksha asked Yudhisthira Maharaj. And Yudhisthira Maharaj very satisfactorily answered all of them from the perspective of the Vedas. Finally, the Yaksha told Yudhisthira Maharaj, I am very much satisfied by all your questions. Now, I have got final four questions for you. If you can answer these four also, I will bring back one of your brothers to life. Now, out of these four questions, two questions were very very important. What were these two questions? One question which this Yaksha asked Yudhisthira Maharaj was, Kim Ashtariam, what is the most amazing, surprising thing in this world? To which, Yudhisthira Maharaj replied, What can be more surprising than this? Than the fact that, day after day, living entities are dying, going to the abode of Yamaraj. This is a, this is an established fact. Every day you open the newspaper, there will be an obituary column. And even if that column is a very small representation of the number of people who die. Every day, thousands and lakhs of people die. Every day people are dying. That is not a surprising thing. But what is surprising is, Seshaha, Sthavaramicchanti. Seshaha, those who are surviving, those who are alive, Sthavaramicchanti, they are thinking, I will live forever. My grandfather died, my father died, my uncle died, my brothers died, my friends died, but I am not going to die. I will live forever.

**Key Quote:** "But still, we, whenever somebody dies, we get shocked. Oh, this person died. I cannot believe it. Fact is, every one of us has to die."
**Summary:** Yudhisthira explains that intelligent people understand the temporary nature of life and engage in devotional service to Krishna to escape repeated birth and death.

This is the thinking of people, misguided thinking of the people. Every day people die in accidents, people die out of diseases, people die out of old age, varieties of causes. But still, we, whenever somebody dies, we get shocked. Oh, this person died. I cannot believe it. Fact is, every one of us has to die. But, that is a fact all of us turn a blind eye to. And we always think everybody who is alive will remain alive forever. And I myself will remain alive forever, which is a great illusion. And hence, Yudhishthir Maharaj said, this is the most surprising thing. An intelligent person who has understood this, that life is very temporary, any moment I can die, there is no guarantee to this life. Such an intelligent person will not bother himself about material happiness and material sense gratification, material pursuits. On the other hand, he will take a devotional service to Krishna and try to go back to Godhead where there is no more repeated birth and death. The other important question asked by the Yaksha was, Kimpanthaha, what is the right path for people to follow? To which, Yudhishthir Maharaj replied, We cannot ascertain what is the real path that one has to follow, what is the real goal of life, what is the real purpose of this human form of life. What is the greatest achievement to be aspired for

**Summary:** Yudhisthira explains that the right path cannot be ascertained simply by studying scriptures or using logic due to contradictions and the ever-changing nature of arguments.

in this human form of life. We cannot ascertain this simply by studying scriptures. Why? Because, There are many many scriptures and within the scriptures there are various kinds of contradictory conclusions. If you look at the world, there are many many religious scriptures. You have the Quran, you have the Bible, you have the Torah, you have the Vedas, etc. Now, if you look at the Vedas, within the Vedas itself, the different Puranas, the different Itihasas will give you different conclusions. The Upanishads will give you another kind of conclusion. The Vedanta Sutras will give you another kind of conclusion. So, which is the ultimate conclusion that I am supposed to follow? You cannot understand that simply by studying the scriptures. So, if I cannot understand this by scriptures, I will understand it by logic. Tar ko apratishta. By logic, it is not possible to establish what is the ultimate goal of life. Because, today, I am a good logician. I come up with some logic and everybody appreciates it and everybody praises me and everybody says, yes, wonderful logic. Tomorrow, somebody else will come up who is more intelligent than me and he will counter my logic with another logic of his own. So, logic, it can only lead to arguments. It cannot lead to a conclusion. Hence, logic also fails.

**Summary:** Yudhisthira states that approaching saintly persons also doesn't guarantee understanding the real conclusion of the Vedas, and the correct path is to follow in the footsteps of the Mahajanas (great authorities).

Then, okay, I will approach some saintly person, some sadhu and I will try to understand from him. Even that does not work. Because, nasavrishir yasya matam na bhinnam The definition of the word muni or rishi is a person who has some sort of opinion which is different from all the others. Nasavrishir, a person cannot be called a rishi or a muni until and unless, matam na bhinnam, until and unless he has a bhinnamata, he has a different opinion about the conclusion of life from all the other rishis and sages. Therefore, simply by approaching any and every sadhu also, it is not possible to understand what is the real conclusion of the Vedas, of the scriptures. Then, what is the kinpantha, what is the path to follow? How does a person understand? What is the right path to follow? Mahajanoyena gatha sapantaha One has to follow in the footsteps of the Mahajanas. Who are these Mahajanas? These Mahajanas are numbered twelve. Twelve Mahajanas are there listed by Yama Raj in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So, these twelve Mahajanas, Yama Raj himself, Brahmaji, Narada Muni, Yasadev, Kapila Muni, and Prahalad Maharaj, Janaka Dev, Bhishma Dev, the four Kumaras, these are all the people who are considered the Mahajanas. These Mahajanas, these twelve Mahajanas, actually know what is the real path of Dharma. Nobody else can ascertain it without following their instructions.

**Key Quote:** "In other words, if we follow the path of Dharma in a gurusishya parampara which is stemming from one of these Mahajanas, then we will be able to understand what is the real goal of life."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of following a guru-shishya parampara (disciplic succession) stemming from one of the twelve Mahajanas to understand the real goal of life.

In other words, if we follow the path of Dharma in a gurusishya parampara which is stemming from one of these Mahajanas, then we will be able to understand what is the real goal of life. If we approach any gurusishya parampara which is not connected to one of these Mahajanas, then one cannot understand what is the real goal of life. For example, there are four sampradayas which are actually bona fide. One is stemming from Brahmaji himself which is called the Brahma sampradaya. And in this sampradaya comes Madhvacharya as well as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and the Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya is also coming from the Brahma sampradaya. Then there is the sampradaya stemming from Lord Shiva which is called the Rudra sampradaya in which Vishnu Swami is the prominent Acharya. Then there is the Sri sampradaya stemming from Lakshmi Devi in which Ramanuja Acharya is the prominent Acharya. Ramanuja Acharya, Yamuna Acharya and many others in that sampradaya. The fourth one is the Kumara sampradaya stemming from the four Kumaras, the Sanath Kumaras who are the four sons of Brahmaji. They are the initiators of another sampradaya. And in this sampradaya, the prominent Acharya is Nimbarka Swami. If we want to understand the real conclusion of the Vedas, one has to be connected to one of these four sampradayas. Otherwise, it is not possible to understand the real conclusion of the Vedas.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that even though the scriptures are readily available, the true essence of Dharma remains hidden, and understanding requires connection to one of the four Vaishnava sampradayas.

Now why is it like this? Because the Dharmasya Tatvam Nihitam Guhayam although all the Vedas are in black and white, Bhagavad Gita is in black and white, 700 shlokas, very simple Sanskrit, not very complicated, but still, people do not understand that the real conclusion of the Bhagavad Gita is that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the duty of every living entity is to surrender to Him as our Lord and Master. This conclusion misses many people, all those people who are not connected to the sampradaya. There are more than 700 editions of the Bhagavad Gita in English alone in the market. But if you read them, you will never get this conclusion that Krishna is the Supreme Person and we are all His eternally, His part and parcel servants. This conclusion you can get only by reading the Bhagavad Gita As It Is by His divine grace, Srila Prabhupada. Therefore, Yudhisthira Maharaj said, even though the Vedas may be in black and white, even though a person may be a Sanskrit scholar, simply by reading the Vedas or simply going to any and every sadhu, simply by using one's logic and intelligence, one cannot understand the real conclusion of the Vedic scriptures. The real understanding if you want to get, then you have to approach one of these four Vaishnava sampradayas.

**Summary:** The Yaksha is pleased with Yudhisthira's answers and offers to bring one of his brothers back to life, presenting Yudhisthira with a difficult choice.

Otherwise it is not possible. Now when Yudhisthira Maharaj finally gave this answer, what was the reaction of the Yaksha and what did he do? The Yaksha became very pleased. He was satisfied with Yudhisthira Maharaj's reply. And he told Yudhisthira Maharaj that I am very very satisfied with your answers. All of your answers are fully in accordance with Dharma, fully in accordance with righteousness as enjoined in the Vedic scriptures. And therefore, as per my promise, I will bring back to life any one of your brothers. You choose whom you want to bring back to life. Now whom did Yudhisthira Maharaj choose to bring back to life? Did he choose Bhima or did he choose Arjuna? Because both of them were the most powerful warriors. Very quickly there was going to be the situation where they would have to take back the kingdom for Duryodhana which was not going to be easy. He was not going to give it on his own. Most likely there would be a battle. And if Yudhisthira Maharaj had to win that battle, the support of Bhima and Arjuna was very essential. Without them he could not think of winning the war. So did he choose Bhima or Arjuna over and above the two brothers Nakula and Sahadeva? Furthermore, Nakula and Sahadeva were his step-brothers, whereas Bhima and Arjuna were his own brothers. Whom did Yudhisthira Maharaj choose? Please join us in the next episode of the Mahabharata.

**Summary:** A recap of the previous episode, focusing on Yudhishthira's encounter with the Yaksha and the dilemma of choosing which brother to bring back to life.

A warm welcome to all of you to today's episode. In the last episode of the Mahabharata, we have seen how Yudhishthira managed to answer all the questions of the Yaksha at the lake of death very satisfactorily. We were told that once Yudhishthira Maharaja had answered all the questions which covered a wide range of topics from dharma to spirituality to material duties etc., after all that, the yaksha informed Yudhishthira Maharaja that he would bring one of his brothers back to life. He would want to bring back to life. The question was whether Yudhishthira would choose Bhima or Arjuna because they were the most powerful warriors and they were the two brothers on whom Yudhishthira Maharaj was entirely dependent upon to win a battle against Duryodhana if it arose, if it was required to get back their kingdom.

**Key Quote:** "When the Yaksha asked Yudhishthira Maharaj to choose one of his brothers to bring back to life, Yudhishthira Maharaj responded that please bring back Nakula to life."
**Summary:** Yudhishthira's surprising choice of Nakula is explained through the lens of dharma, emphasizing equanimity and fairness to both mothers, Kunti and Madri.

Without these two, Yudhishthira Maharaj would be really crippled. When the Yaksha asked Yudhishthira Maharaj to choose one of his brothers to bring back to life, Yudhishthira Maharaj responded that please bring back Nakula to life. This was a very surprising thing. The Yaksha was taken aback. And he asked Yudhishthira Maharaj, Yudhishthira, that everyone knows that Bhima is very dear to you and he has the strength of thousands of elephants put together and Arjuna also is a warrior par excellence. Even the Devatas cannot stand in front of him in battle. Instead of choosing one of these two, the Yaksha asked Yudhishthira Maharaj, why have he chosen your step-brother Nakula? What is the reason? In response, Yudhishthira Maharaj replied, dharma yeva hato hanti dharmo rakshati rakshitah tasmad dharmam nathya jami. He said, Yudhishthira Maharaj replied to the Yaksha, that you see, whoever neglects dharma or does not follow the path of the Yaksha, he is not worthy of the Yaksha. He is not worthy of the Yaksha. He is not worthy of the Yaksha. Whoever does not follow the path of the Brahma, he will eventually be vanquished. Dharma, hato, hanti. A person who brings about the downfall of Dharma himself, will undergo destruction. On the other hand, dharma, rakshati rakshitah. One who protects Dharma will in turn be protected. Tasmad dharmam nathya jami. Therefore, I will not give up Dharma. I will go and save your life. the path of Dharma. Now, what does the following of Dharma have got to do with bringing back Nakula to life? Yudhishthir Maharaj explained to the Yaksha that his father had two wives Kunti and Madri and Yudhishthir Maharaj said, for me both Kunti and Madri are equal to me, both of them are my mothers and I see both of them equally. I am still alive who am Kunti's son. Now, if only one of my brothers is going to be brought back to life, then let one of the sons of Madri also live and that is why I have chosen Nakula and this is according to the rules of

**Key Quote:** "When Yudhishthir Maharaj replied like this, the Yaksha replied, I am very pleased by your benevolence and by your equanimity, your equal vision towards all your brothers. Therefore, I am bringing back all your brothers back to life"
**Summary:** The Yaksha, revealed to be Yamaraja, is pleased with Yudhishthira's adherence to dharma and offers him boons after testing him.

Dharma where kindness is supposed to be practiced by everyone. When Yudhishthir Maharaj replied like this, the Yaksha replied, I am very pleased by your benevolence and by your equanimity, your equal vision towards all your brothers. Therefore, I am bringing back all your brothers back to life and slowly all the four Pandavas who are lying almost dead on the ground next to Yudhishthir Maharaj opened their eyes and they got up as if they had just woken up from some deep slumber. And surprisingly enough, they were no longer feeling thirsty and they felt completely refreshed. When Yudhishthira Maharaj saw this, he looked at the Yaksha and he told him, My dear Yaksha, I don't believe you are a normal Yaksha. No normal Yaksha can do what you have done. First of all, to kill my brothers is impossible for any ordinary Yaksha to do. And after killing them, bringing them back to life. This is indeed a real miracle, which only some great Devata can do. So it is hard for me to believe that you are a simple Yaksha. Please, if you feel it appropriate, please kindly reveal yourself. The Yaksha then suddenly transformed into a Dami God, bedecked with a lot of golden ornaments and wearing silk clothes and looking very handsome. The demigodd revealed Himself to be the Yamaradj who is also known as Dharma Raja. And he responded to Yudhishthira that, My dear son, please know that, I am your father Yamaradj. And today, I have been very pleased with you, I just wanted to test you. And that is how I created this whole situation and I am very pleased with the way you have reacted.

**Key Quote:** "O my Lord, if you want to bless me, kindly give us a boon that that Brahmana whose Arani sticks were taken away by the deer, his Yajna may not be stopped and he should be able to continue his Yajna."
**Summary:** Yudhishthira prioritizes the restoration of a Brahmana's firewood for sacrifice over reclaiming his kingdom, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to dharma and detachment from material desires.

Therefore, being pleased with you, I want to give you some boon. So please ask me whatever you would like to ask. Immediately Yudhishthira Maharaj replied, O my Lord, if you want to bless me, kindly give us a boon that that Brahmana whose Arani sticks were taken away by the deer, his Yajna may not be stopped and he should be able to continue his Yajna. And then Yamaraja replied to Yudhishthira Maharaj, My dear son, please know that the deer was not an ordinary deer, but it was I who took the form of a deer and took away the Arani sticks to lure you to this place so that I could test all of you. Therefore, I am immediately granting you the boon that you have requested for that the Brahmana's Arani wood, the wood for the fire sacrifice, I will return. And immediately he returned the firewood to Yudhishthira Maharaj. And after this, Yamaraja asked Yudhishthira Maharaj, My dear son, I am not satisfied with giving you this boon. This is hardly anything. Please ask something more from me. Actually, Yudhishthira Maharaj could have asked, asked Yamaraja for the kingdom, to get back the kingdom that they had lost. But Yudhishthira Maharaj was so fixed in Dharma that he saw that at the present moment, to get back that Brahmana's firewood sticks was the most important thing for them. Otherwise, they would not be upholding Dharma. And that is why he asked for that. Yudhishthira Maharaj was not so much interested in occupying the throne, having a kingdom, and getting back his lost kingdom. I should take revenge upon Duryodhana. Those things were not there in his heart at all. He was always treading the path of Dharma. And as far as he was concerned, he was quite happy living in the forest, leading an austere life, wearing tree bark for clothes, devoid of all the royal opulence and servants and all the army. And all such things. He was happy as long as he was able to follow the path of Dharma. As far as the kingdom was concerned, in due course of time, according to the law of karma, if they had to get back the kingdom, they would get it. If they would not get, if they were not destined to get it, they would not get it back. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj was not so keen. He was not so concerned about getting back the kingdom.

**Summary:** Yudhishthira requests boons for a successful incognito exile and freedom from negative qualities like lust, anger, and greed, which Yamaraja grants.

Now, when Yamaraja asked him to ask for one more boon, then Yudhishthira Maharaj replied to him that if you want to grant us one more boon, then please bless us that now our 12th year of forest exile is getting over and next year, one year we have to live incognito. If you so wish, please bless us that we may be able to carry out this exile in incognito successfully. Immediately, Dharmaraj replied that, so be it my son, I grant you your boon. In fact, I bless you that even if you roam around in all the prominent cities, dressed in the same way that you are currently as the Pandavas, nobody will be able to recognize you. Even if you go without any disguise, even if you present yourself as you are, nobody will be able to recognize you. This is my boon to you and therefore, I am blessing you that the next one year which you have to live incognito, go to the kingdom of Virata and spend your one year there. And then Yamaaraj said to Yudhishthira Maharaj that I am not satisfied with just giving you two more boons. I want to give you one more boon. Please ask. To which Yudhishthira Maharaj replied, please bless me that I will always tread the path of dharma and I will never be overcome by kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha, matsarya, these six enemies, which are there in the heart. And I will always be able to tread the path of truthfulness. Yamaaraj replied that my dear Yudhishthira Maharaj, right from your birth, by your very nature, you are always on the path of dharma. You are always truthful and kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha and matsarya have no place in your heart. But still since you are asking, I bless you that you will continue to be free from these voids. And so being blessed by Yamaaraj like this, the Pandavas became very happy and then Yamaaraj also disappeared from the spot.

**Summary:** The Pandavas return the firewood, spend the rainy season in the forest, and then decide to go to Viratanagara for their incognito exile.

Then taking the Brahmana's Arani firewood, the five Pandava brothers they returned and they handed over the firewood to the Brahmana and they continued to live in the forest for the next four months which were the rainy season. Generally in North India, the months starting from July up till about September, these four months are the rainy season. And during the rainy season, during those days, the practice was that people would not travel anywhere, they will stay wherever they are to avoid the troubles of walking through muddy patches of land and also the rainy season is the time when the forest become infested with snakes etc. It's not safe also to travel during the rainy season. So the Pandavas stayed in the Dwaitavana itself for the remainder of the rainy season and once the rainy season was over, the Pandavas started discussing amongst themselves that now the time has come that we have to live incognito. Now where do we go? After discussing various options, they decided that as per what Yamaaraj had blessed them with, they should go to the place known as Viratanagara. This Viratanagara was so called because it was being ruled over by King Virata and the kingdom was also known as the kingdom of Matsya. And this Matsya kingdom, some people say that it is in Rajasthan and Viratanagara is about 60 kilometers from Jaipur. Some other people say it is a place called Bhairhat in Bengal. Either way, it was quite a distance from wherever the Pandavas were there and they undertook a long journey by foot to cover the distance.

**Key Quote:** "Before leaving for Viratanagara, the Pandavas, they sent whatever servants and maidservants they had, they sent them all back to Hastinapura"
**Summary:** The Pandavas prepare for their incognito exile by sending away their servants and deciding on their disguises: Yudhishthira as Kanka, Bhima as Vallabha, and Arjuna as Brihannala, remembering Urvasi's curse.

Before leaving for Viratanagara, the Pandavas, they sent whatever servants and maidservants they had, they sent them all back to Hastinapura and they requested Dhaumya also to... Dhaumya was their family priest who was staying with them. They requested leave from him also. And the Pandavas left all on their own to Viratanagara. Having reached Viratanagara, the Pandavas started discussing amongst themselves, how they would disguise themselves and what they would present themselves as. Although, Yamaraj had blessed them that even if they were to walk around as it was, as they were, nobody would recognize them. Still, they thought it better to disguise themselves. Yudhishthir Maharaj told his brothers that, I will become Kanka and I will become an advisor to Virat Maharaj. I will introduce myself to Virat Maharaj, saying that I used to be an advisor in Yudhishthir Maharaj's court. And now that Yudhishthir Maharaj and the Pandavas are in forest exile, I don't have a job, so I have come seeking a job with you. Then he looked at Bhima and he said, what will you do? Bhima said, I am very good in cooking. I will go to Virat Maharaj and I will tell him, I was a cook in Yudhishthir Maharaj's kitchen and I also know a little bit of wrestling. So please appoint me as a cook in your kitchen and I will make wonderful dishes for you. And also whenever some free time is there, I will wrestle some lions and elephants and all that. And I will keep you entertained. Next, Yudhishthir Maharaj turned to Arjuna and asked him, my dear Arjuna, what will you present yourself as? At that time, Arjuna remembered when he had been to the heavenly kingdom on the invitation of Indra, Urvasi had approached him, but on the plea that Urvasi was the wife of one of the ancestors of Arjuna's dynasty, the King Pururava, whose wife was Urvasi, Arjuna said, you are like my mother and therefore I cannot see you in any other manner. And being rebuffed like this, Urvasi being frustrated in her advances towards Arjuna, she cursed him that for one year he will have to become a eunuch. Now Arjuna remembered that curse of Urvasi and he said, now is the time for Urvasi's curse to take place. I'll become a eunuch. And because I know good music and dancing, I will teach all the women folk in Virat Maharaj's palace, all the different forms of singing and dance. So the brothers were surprised to hear this. Arjuna, the great warrior, he is going to become a eunuch for one year. Anyway, this is all destiny. The Lord's leelas are like this.

**Key Quote:** "Then Yudhishthira Maharaj turned to Sahadeva and asked him, what will you do?"
**Summary:** Sahadeva and Nakula choose their disguises as a cowherd and horse caretaker, respectively, and the Pandavas cleverly hide their weapons in a tree at the crematorium.

Then Yudhishthira Maharaj turned to Sahadeva and asked him, what will you do? Sahadeva replied, I will become a cowherd by the name Tantripala and I will take care of the cows in Virat Maharaj's palace. And then Nakula said that I will become Granthika, a person who takes care of horses, because Nakula was very expert in identifying horses, taking care of them, breeding them, etc. And therefore Nakula said, I will take a place in the stable of Virat Maharaj. Having discussed like this, all the Pandavas decided that okay, now we know what all we will become. And so therefore, now what to do with all our weapons? If the cook Bhima, who is going to be the cook named Vallabha, if he is going to go with his Ghada into the assembly, then nobody will believe that he is a cook. And if Arjuna goes with his Gandiva and says, I am a unit, nobody is going to believe him. Therefore, all the Pandavas wrapped up all their weapons in a nice piece of cloth, completely covered it up. And when they approached Virat Nagar, at the entry to the Virat Nagara, they came across a big crematorium. And outside the crematorium was a big semi-tree. They climbed onto the semi-tree and on the top of the semi-tree, they kept all the packed weapons. And they left the place. Some people were there who were coming to the crematorium. They came across some people and they told them in our custom, all dead bodies we cover in cloth and keep it on top of the semi-tree so that the soul goes to heaven. And our mother recently passed away. So we have put her corpse, we have covered it in a cloth and kept it on the top. When the people heard, they said, oh my God, corpse up there, we should not touch it. And this way, the Pandavas thought, nobody will touch those.

**Summary:** Yudhishthira (as Kanka) and Bhima (as Vallabha) gain employment in King Virata's court, while Draupadi (as Sairindri) seeks service with Queen Sudeshna.

Nobody will become curious enough to go and unpack those weapons. The first day, Yudhishthir Maharaj entered the court of Virat Maharaj and he introduced himself as Kanka. And he told the king that he had been an advisor in the court of Yudhishthir Maharaj. And when Virat Maharaj heard this, Virata was actually a great front of the Pandavas. When he heard that this Kanka had been an advisor in Yudhishthir Maharaj's palace, he very warmly welcomed Kanka and he told him, please welcome, please be an advisor to me also. I don't know how the Pandavas are living in the forest. It is a very unfortunate situation. I hope very quickly that gets over. He was also feeling a little bad about that. The following day, Bhima entered the court of Virata Maharaj. And he introduced himself as Vallabha, the cook. And he told the king that please appoint me in your kitchen. I used to cook in Yudhishthir Maharaj's kitchen. And I know a variety of dishes and every day I will cook very fine dishes for you. The king was very pleased to see this huge able-bodied cook. And he said, okay, since you are coming from Yudhishthir Maharaj's kitchen, you must definitely be a good cook. So right away, I am appointing you. The next day, Draupadi entered the kingdom. And she approached the king Virata's wife, Sudeshna. And she introduced herself as a class of maidservants known as Sairindri. And she informed Sudeshna that she had been earlier a servant of Draupadi as well as Satyabhama. And now that Draupadi had gone into the forest in exile, she had lost her job and she was looking for a job. And that's how she had come to meet Sudeshna seeking an employment. Sudeshna, when she looked at this woman, she saw that she was extremely exquisitely beautiful. She told her that if you have served as Satyabhama, Krishna's wife and Draupadi, definitely you must be very qualified. I will be very happy to have you with me. But seeing your beauty, I am very afraid that the king may get carried away and he may think of making you the queen. Then what will become of me?

**Summary:** Draupadi sets conditions for her service, and Arjuna, disguised as Brihannala, is accepted as a dance teacher for Princess Uttara after being confirmed as a eunuch.

Then this Sairindri maidservant replied to Sudeshna that please do not worry. I am married to five Gandharva husbands and I am completely devoted and chaste to my husbands. I will never look at any other man. As far as you are concerned, you protect me from other men. I will be only with you. I don't want to be in any place where the men will be able to see me. When Sudeshna heard this, she said, okay, in that case, I am quite pacified that you will not try to woo my husband and take over my place. Then I am willing to appoint you as a maidservant in my palace. And then Draupadi told Sudeshna two conditions I want to put before you. One is that you will not make me wash anybody's feet and I will not eat any leftover food. Sudeshna immediately agreed. She said, no problem. I will ensure that you get the best food and you won't have to wash anybody's feet. The next day, Arjuna walked into the court of Virataraj and everyone was astonished to see this huge bodied man dressed in a sari and hands full of bangles and walking like a woman, although externally it was obvious that it was a man. And the King Virata was also astonished. And he asked, who are you? Where have you come from? And why have you come to my court? Then this Brihannala, this eunuch introduced herself saying that my name is Brihannala. I am a eunuch and I have no parents. I know the art of singing and dance. So I am requesting you. Please appoint me to teach the art of dancing and singing to your daughter Uttara. The King Virata also looked at Brihannala and then he said that if you are truly a eunuch, I don't mind appointing you. And so he had a few maidservants from his palace inspect Brihannala. They took away Brihannala for some time and they came back and they reported to the King that they have tested him. He is clearly a eunuch. He is not a male. Then Virata, Virata Maharaj was also happy to appoint Brihannala as a teacher of dance and singing for his daughter Uttara. And because of Urvashi's curse, Arjuna in the form of Brihannala felt no lusty desires awakening in his heart, even when he was in the midst of all the women folk in the palace.

**Key Quote:** "So, in case of any danger and in case of need of any help, they decided on code names by which they would call each other."
**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, detailing the Pandavas' decision to go incognito in the kingdom of Virata, their chosen disguises, and the secret code names they established for emergencies.

All of you are welcome to this next episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode, we have seen how the Pandavas had completed their 12 years of forest exile and now it was time for them to go incognito. And fortunately, they also happened to receive the blessings of Yamaraj, by which they were assured that they would be able to successfully go back to their native land. They were able to successfully pass the time of one year incognito without anyone recognizing them. Having now obtained the boon from Yamaraj, still the Pandavas felt it wise to disguise themselves and as advised by Yamaraj, they decided to go to the kingdom of Virata. And in the kingdom of Virata, the five Pandavas entered Virata separately. Yudhishthir Maharaj became Kanka, an advisor to the king. Bhima became Vallabha, a cook in the royal kitchens. Draupadi became Sairindri, a maid-servant who dresses the hairs for the queen of King Virata, Sudeshna. Arjuna became Brihannala, a eunuch, and he was appointed by King Virata to teach art of dance and music to his young daughter Uttara. And then Nakula became Granthika, who was going to take care of the horses in the stable of King Virata. Sahadeva became Tantripala, who was going to take care of the cows of King Virata. After entering the kingdom of Virata, the Pandavas had a secret code by which they would call each other if any one of them were to be in any kind of trouble or danger and they needed the help of the others. In case they were in danger, because they were all entering separately and they were not in their disguise going to reveal that they were related to each other in any way, they would not be able to call out the names what they had assumed, nor could they call out their original names. So, in case of any danger and in case of need of any help, they decided on code names by which they would call each other. So, they gave themselves the names of Jayanta, Vijaya, Jaya, Jayat Sena, Jayat Bala. Like this, they gave each other names by which they could call out, any one of them could call out the other's names, and then immediately the others would understand that there is some danger and this person needed help.

**Key Quote:** "Although Keechaka was a disturbance, he was also a great protective shield for Virata's kingdom."
**Summary:** The lecture describes Duryodhana's efforts to uncover the Pandavas' disguise and introduces Keechaka, the powerful commander-in-chief of Virata's army, highlighting his influence and the kingdom's dependence on him.

Now, the Pandavas, they had entranced themselves in their respective positions and things were going quite smoothly. Nobody had detected them. In the meantime, Duryodhana had started sending spies all over the place. They were going to various kingdoms and they were observing who are the kind of people there, whether the Pandavas are there or not. Because Duryodhana's intention was, if somehow or the other he is able to uncover their disguise, then again the Pandavas would have to go into another 12 years of forest exile. So, he could very comfortably, without any opposition, he could enjoy the kingdom of the Pandavas as well as his own kingdom which was Hastinapura. Now, although the spies were going everywhere, they could not find any trace of the Pandavas. And so, the Pandavas were able to keep up their disguise very effectively for more than 10 months. During these 10 months, the Pandavas were able to live peacefully. More or less, they were avoiding all attention. And Bhima would also, because he was a cook, he was in the kitchen, whenever he would cook some delicacies, he would come in the night secretly, meet with his other brothers and share with them. And sometimes Tantripala would get some cow milk products, he would share it with his brothers. And sometimes Yudhishthira would get some gifts from the king, he would come and share it with the brothers. So, like this, they were managing to pass their time. Although they were not very happy being servants to subordinate kings, it was not the ideal position to be in, but they were not in any kind of trouble also. Now, like this, after more than 10 months had passed, they were into the 11th month. This queen Sudeshna had a brother and the name of this brother was Keechaka. He was extremely powerful and very well built and he was very expert in fighting and in the art of warfare. Therefore, King Virata had appointed Keechaka as his commander-in-chief of his army. Now, this Keechaka was quite a terror and he had created lot of problems for all the surrounding neighboring kingdoms and even for the Kauravas, this Keechaka was a headache. But then he was quite powerful, so nobody dared to oppose him openly like that. Nobody wanted a direct confrontation like that. So, to maintain peace, they would tolerate his, he would sometimes encroach on them. He would encroach into others' kingdoms. He would go and sometimes pillage a town or something like that. Those kind of things he was off and on doing. But rival kings were keeping distance because they didn't want to antagonize him. And Virata was also heavily dependent on Keechaka for the protection of his kingdom. Although Keechaka was a disturbance, he was also a great protective shield for Virata's kingdom. Otherwise, the surrounding neighboring enemy kings could easily swallow the kingdom of Virata. Virata, King Virata himself was not so powerful. So, he was quite lenient and he used to not take too much notice of the wrongdoings of Keechaka.

**Key Quote:** "Actually, you should be in a much better condition than this. Why don't you become my queen?"
**Summary:** Keechaka sees Draupadi (Sairindri) and becomes infatuated with her, proposing to her and being rebuffed. He then enlists his sister Sudeshna's help to woo her.

Now, this Keechaka one day happened to visit his sister Sudeshna and there he happened to see Draupadi who was a Sai Rindri. Now, when he saw her, immediately this Keechaka, he was infatuated with her. And he was not a man of any great good morals or something like that. So, he immediately developed lusty desires towards Sai Rindri. And he started asking Sudeshna, Who is this girl? I have never seen her before. Where has she come from? What is she doing? And all these kind of things. And then when Draupadi, Sai Rindri came to Sudeshna for some work, immediately Keechaka started talking to her. Oh, my beautiful girl. Who are you? Where are you from? I have never seen you before. I am Keechaka. I am the commander of the king's army. So, you are serving like a maid servant in my sister's palace. Actually, you should be in a much better condition than this. Why don't you become my queen? Like this, he started talking. Now, Sai Rindri immediately, she got alarmed. What is this man saying? All these months, she had managed to keep a low profile and avoid the gaze of any men. And somehow, she was managing. Because Draupadi was exquisitely beautiful. That was the fear that Sudeshna also had. Now, Keechaka's eyes, unfortunately, fell on Sai Rindri. Now, Sai Rindri, immediately she was taken aback. And she said, Oh, my... Oh, king, please don't talk like this. Because I am already wedded to another person. So, it is not appropriate for a person like you, who is from a royal family, to set his eyes upon a woman who is already married. This is against the principles of Dharma. So, please give up such thoughts. And please avoid thinking of me in such way. And give up any hopes like this if you have towards developing any relationship with me. Like this, Sai Rindri said. And she immediately turned and walked away. Now, Keechaka was not someone to give up so easily. Although he was rebuffed by Sai Rindri, he was not, in the least, he was not deterred. He spoke to Sudeshna and he said that somehow I have to get her. How to get her hand? How to woo her? How to make her agree to my proposal? So, Sudeshna looked at her brother. And because he was, after all, her brother, she said, Don't worry, because in front of everybody, she might have felt a little shy. So, she might have spoken like that. I will create some excuse and send her to you for some small work. At that time, in a secluded place, you propose to her. Maybe, if you nicely talk to her, she may change her mind also. Sudeshna said like this. Because in those times, in the royal family, sometimes the kings would have relationships with some of the maid servants also. Although they may not be wedded with the maid servants. And this was not so uncommon. And so, Sudeshna thought, Maybe, Sairendri may become interested. If she becomes interested and both adults are consenting, then what's the problem?

**Key Quote:** "Oh, my dear lady, you have already seen that day, how he was talking to me. And he has these kind of lusty desires to me."
**Summary:** Sudeshna, despite Draupadi's objections, sends her to Keechaka's chambers. Draupadi prays to Suryadeva for protection as she goes.

So, then, after a few days, Sudeshna found some opportunity. And she told Draupadi, Sairendri, that you please fetch some rice and some other things from my brother's chambers. You please go and get it. Now, Sairendri immediately told Sudeshna, Oh, my dear lady, you have already seen that day, how he was talking to me. And he has these kind of lusty desires to me. Now, if I go to his chambers, God alone knows what is going to happen. So, please don't put me into this kind of a dilemma. Please don't put me into any embarrassing situation like this. Now, Sudeshna, she dismissed her. She said, don't worry. You tell him that I have sent you. So, he will not try anything wrong with you. He will not misbehave with you. Don't worry about that. He is not going to have that much guts to do something. Then, I have sent somebody. So, don't worry. Like that, Sudeshna, somehow she brushed aside Sairendri's objections and sent her. Now, Sairendri, what to do? Now, she was almost on the verge of crying. She knew what was going to happen with Keechaka. And so, as she stepped out of the place and then she was proceeding towards the Keechaka's chambers, she looked up at the sky and looked at Suryadeva. Suryadeva, the sun was shining very strongly. So, she looked up at him and she prayed, please protect me, like that, and she went. It was a very informal kind of prayer from her side, from Draupadi's side. But then, what we have to understand is, all the Pandavas, including Draupadi, are great devotees of Lord Krishna. And in the Rig Veda also it is said, OM TAD VISHNOH PARAMAM PADAM SADAPASHYANTI SURAYAH DIVIVA CHAKSHU RATATAM TAD VIPRASO VIPANYAVO JAGRAVAMSA SAMINDATE VISHNO ORYAT PARAMAM PADAM.

**Key Quote:** "If you want to love me, first learn to love my dog."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the relationship between the Devatas and Vishnu, emphasizing that devotion to Vishnu extends to his devotees. Suryadeva, recognizing Draupadi's devotion to Krishna, sends a Rakshasa to protect her.

Vishnu's lotus feet are considered the supreme destination, even for the Devatas. So, even the Devatas are constantly waiting, when can we have darshan of the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu. So, all the Devatas are always trying to please Lord Vishnu. They are trying to please and serve Lord Vishnu in some way or the other. Why? Because Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, AHAM ADHIRHI DEVANAM. Krishna is the source of all the Devatas. The Devatas are all created by Krishna himself, by Vishnu. So, naturally, Krishna, so Vishnu being the supreme creator, all the Devatas are always looking for opportunities to serve Vishnu. Now, there is a saying that, If you want to love me, first learn to love my dog. The idea behind this saying is that, If you want to love me, then you should love everyone else that I also love. You cannot say that I love you, but I hate your father and mother. I am a big enemy of your brother, but I love you. You cannot say that. If you have to love me, then you have to love all the people that I love also. This is generally saying like that. So, all the Devatas, the demigods, they are all great devotees of Vishnu. They are also very respectful and devoted to all the devotees of Vishnu. Now, the Pandavas are great devotees of Lord Krishna. They are eternal associates of Lord Krishna. Therefore, all the Devatas, all the demigods have the greatest of respect for the Pandavas. And naturally, Suri Deva also, when he saw that, Draupadi has asked for my protection, then he felt obliged. Oh, she is a great devotee of Krishna, so I have to provide protection to her. Although, she asked very casually, just in a passing, she asked Draupadi. But still, for Suri Deva, it was like a great prayer for him. Because, Draupadi was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. And so, immediately, Suri Deva summoned one Rakshasa and told him, Please go and always, whenever there is a problem, Draupadi steps out of her residence, always be with her. And constantly protect her. And so, this Rakshasa, he invisibly started following Draupadi,

who walked into Keechaka's chamber. Now, when Draupadi walked into Keechaka's chamber, Keechaka was very happy to see her. He was very glad to see her. Ah! Sairendri has come. Of course, he could not see the Rakshasa who was following close behind, whom Surya had sent. And so, he said, Oh! My Sairendri, my dear lady, you have come. Please tell me, what have you come for? What is the purpose? Sairendri said, Sudeshna has asked for some things, which I have to take from here. Please provide to me. The queen is also waiting. I should not keep her waiting. Quickly, I have to go. Please, as soon as possible, please hand over the things. Keechaka, she was carrying a golden pot in her hand. Keechaka took the pot from her. And he gave it to one of his servants who was standing there. And he said, Don't worry. My servants will take care of it. Fill it and send it to Sudeshna. And he said, You don't worry. You sit with me. You sit down. I want to talk to you. And he started all kinds of sweet talks, which Sairendri was not happy to hear. And he said, Sorry, I have to take this. I have been given the order by Sudeshna. So, please don't prevent me. Please give me the pot. I want to take it and go. And if you are not giving it to me, I will go myself. And then, Keechaka, what he did? He caught hold of Sairendri. And he started pulling her to him. Now, Sairendri got alarmed. Now, what to do? She gave Keechaka one push on the chest. And this caught Keechaka completely unaware. And because he was not expecting it, he got off balance and he fell down. Taking the opportunity, immediately Draupadi turned and she fled out of the room. And Keechaka managed to pull himself together. Then he got up. Then he started chasing Sairendri. Hey, where are you going? Stop. Wait. I am telling you to stop. Like that. Now, Sairendri, she got very afraid. Now, this Keechaka is not leaving me. He is pursuing me. Now, where shall I go? What shall I do? She ran into the court, into the assembly of King Virata. Where Virata was sitting, all his ministers were sitting. And it so happened that Kanka and Vallabha were also in the assembly at that point of time. Sairendri ran into that assembly. And from behind, Keechaka is pursuing. And the moment she entered the assembly, Keechaka caught hold of her hair and he started dragging her. And when Draupadi tried to resist, Keechaka gave her a mighty kick on her back. And Sairendri fell down on the floor. Now, when this happened, the Rakshasa, who was sent by Surya, he could not tolerate. He went and gave one strong kick to Keechaka on his chest. And Keechaka fell over and he got thrown behind. He was flung behind. And he went and landed on the floor. And the impact was so huge that he got completely disoriented. And then he started looking around. He was completely dazed. What had happened? Suddenly, from somewhere, some foals came and flung him on the floor with a huge impact on the chest. And he was not able to figure out what happened.

**Summary:** Draupadi pleads for justice in the assembly, criticizing the inaction of King Virata and indirectly appealing to Yudhishthira and Bhima. Bhima is enraged but restrained by Yudhishthira to protect their disguise.

And nobody could figure out what happened suddenly to Keechaka. And seeing the opportunity, that Keechaka was dazed and he was, for a moment he had forgotten about this Sairendri, she got up and started pleading to Virata, O my king, please see what kind of thing is happening in your kingdom. A woman's honour is being violated. That too, right in front of you in your assembly. This Keechaka has come and kicked me in front of you. In front of you in the assembly. And because I resisted his advances. He wanted to own me, although he knows I am a married woman. And he, because I resisted, he has insulted me, humiliated me like this. How can such a thing happen in the presence of such great kings? Indirectly, Draupadi was referring to Yudhishthir Maharaj and to Bhima, who are also there. I have got five Gandharva kings. They are very powerful. Unfortunately, they are not taking any action right now. Otherwise, if they were to take cognisance of this, they would completely annihilate all the people like Keechaka, would have no chance to continue living. So like this, Draupadi indirectly started telling Yudhishthira and Bhima. She was criticizing them. Now, when Bhima saw this, his fury went beyond his control. His eyes went red. His whole body was trembling. And then he stood up to go and attack Keechaka. He would have finished Keechaka right there. But then, that would have blown the disguise of the Pandavas. So immediately, Yudhishthira Maharaj gently tapped Bhima on his hand. And when Bhima looked down and he saw Yudhishthira Maharaj motioning him to sit down, with great difficulty, Bhima restrained himself and sat down.

**Summary:** King Virata hesitates to act against Keechaka. Yudhishthira intervenes, advising Draupadi to leave. Draupadi complies, and Keechaka storms out of the room.

And then King Virata now, he was in a dilemma. He knew that what was happening with Saiyarendri was unjust. At the same time, he did not want to antagonize him. He did not want to antagonize Keechaka because his whole kingdom was resting on his protection. So, Virata, very diplomatically, the King Virata, he said, you please see, maid servant, without hearing both the parties, how can I take a decision? I have not heard what is Keechaka's side of the story. I have heard what you said, but I have to hear what he also has said. Otherwise, how can I decide something? How can I decide that he has behaved unjustly to you? Like this, he started saying. Now, in the meantime, Keechaka had picked himself up and slowly, he was gathering himself and he was coming back to his senses and gathering what had happened, what was going on right there. Now, Yudhishthir Maharaj took advantage of this and he said, maid servant, O Saiyarendri, this is neither the time, nor the opportunity, nor the place for you to air your grievances. Please go back to your chambers and you discuss this with Sudeshna. This is not the place for you to air all your grievances. Please carry on. This is not the, you should not continue to be here. The situation is not favorable. Immediately, Saiyarendri also took the cue from what Kanka had said and she left the palace and went back to Sudeshna's chambers. So, by the time, Keechaka had collected himself, Saiyarendri had already left. And now, what she had already left? So, he also stormed out of the room.

**Key Quote:** "Something has to be done."
**Summary:** Sudeshna expresses anger at Keechaka's actions. Draupadi, fearing further attacks, contemplates a plan to escape his clutches, setting the stage for the next episode.

Sudeshna got very angry. I never expected this from my brother. If he has done this, I will tell the king and see that he is put to the gallows. I will see that he pays for this with his life. Like this, Sudeshna also got very upset, angry because she had not expected that Keechaka would force himself upon her. She had thought he will propose to her. Mostly she may agree. If she doesn't agree, she will come away. Like that she had thought. She had not thought that he would go to this extent of humiliating her, trying to forcibly capture her and all these kind of things. So, it came as a surprise for her also. Then Draupadi told her, no, no, no need for you to complain to King Virata and all that. My Gandharva husbands are there. They will take care. Like that she said and with still tears flowing from her eyes, she went to her chambers and then she started taking rest. And although she went back to her chamber, she took bath because she wanted to take rest. She took bath because she wanted to. She was feeling so bad that Keechaka had touched her with his own hands. So, she felt, you know, let me take bath and purify myself. And after taking bath, she also felt fresh and little pacified. And then she was sitting on her bed and she was thinking, now this much has happened. This Keechaka is not going to keep quiet. He will try somehow or the other to capture me and he will try to violate me. So, this is not going to end here. The matter is not going to end here. Something has to be done. And she also saw how King Virata was helpless in front of Keechaka. So, the king, she could not expect any protection from the king also. And as far as Sudeshna was concerned, she was a simple woman and unlikely that she would be able to withstand the manipulations of Keechaka. Keechaka would again come and try somehow manipulate her and she would, he would mislead her and he would take away Draupadi. So, all these were possibilities that could happen. Now, Draupadi was very worried. What will happen now? How could she protect herself? What to do? How to save herself from Keechaka? And she started thinking. And then slowly a plan dawned upon her. She thought of a plan by which she could escape from the clutches of Keechaka. So, what was the plan that Draupadi had thought of? Please join us in the next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna. Jagatguru Srila Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "When Sairindhri heard this, she also felt this is a good idea and she said, okay, all right, I will do like what you have said."
**Summary:** The Pandavas devise a plan to kill Keechaka, with Draupadi feigning interest in him to lure him into a trap.

you have to vanquish him. The only way is to kill Keechaka. We have no other alternative because if the Pandavas were going to tell that we are Pandavas, this is Draupadi, then their disguise is blown and they will have to go again for another 12 years in the forest exile. Now, there is no other option but to kill this Keechaka. Bhima said, okay, all right, let us do like this. You go back to your quarters now. Tomorrow morning, you go to Keechaka and then Bhima delineated to her a plan which he had formulated, what Sairindhri has to do. When Sairindhri heard this, she also felt this is a good idea and she said, okay, all right, I will do like what you have said. And so, she took leave of Pallava and she went back to her quarters. The night passed, the sun rose, Sairindhri woke up, she bathed, finished all her monsoons. She went back to her quarters and she said, okay, all right, I will do like what you have said. And so, she took leave of Pallava and she went back to her quarters. The night passed, morning ablutions, dressed herself and then she went to Keechaka's chambers. Now, Keechaka, when he saw Sairindhri coming, he was surprised and he thought maybe she has changed her mind and he started singing to her, oh, Sairindhri, you have come out of your own accord. Good, good, good, come, come. You saw what happened in the assembly. You saw how King Virata did not say anything. So, although Virata is king, he is king in name only. Actually, I am the king. I am the de facto king. So, you do not worry. If you become my consort, I am telling you, I will take care of you better than my queen. You will have the position of a queen and I will take care of all your comforts. You do not have to be a servant to anyone in future. Your future is secure. And I am Keechaka. I am practically, I call all the shots here. So, do not worry at all. Like this, Keechaka started talking to Sairindhri. And Sairindhri also acted as if she was favorable towards him. And she told him, you see, that day, I had to behave like that. It was not actually something which I wanted to do. But somehow, things went out of hand that way. I understand your desire also. My worry was that if my Gandharva husbands come to know that we both have associated, then it will create trouble for you as well as me. So, I just want to avoid that. That is all. So, I thought over. And I also desire to have a union with you. So, how to do it was what was bothering my

mind. So, I have thought of an idea. So, immediately, Keechaka got very interested. He said, oh, really? Oh, this was the situation. Then no problem. Tell, we will find some solution. We will work out. Then Sairindhri told him, you see, if both of us, we meet in an isolated, secluded place in the night, when nobody is watching and we unite, nobody should come to know about it as long as it is a secluded place and not in your chambers where all servants are coming and going, already people have seen me coming in and nobody should get a whiff of our relationship, so if my Gandharva kings, my Gandharva husbands don't come to know about my relationship with you then things are no problem, not an issue. So then Keechaka said, so what do you suggest we do? Sairindhri said, there is the dancing hall. There is that hall where all the princesses, the princess Uttara and her companions and all, they go for learning dance and music and all that. They, during daytime, they learn all their dance and music and all that and during night time it is closed and nobody is there, nobody goes there because it is dedicated for the princess and so nobody else goes there and the princess comes only during the daytime for learning, night time she doesn't come there, so night time is completely deserted. So tonight why don't you come there? I will also come and then I will try to satisfy you to the best of my ability. Keechaka was thrilled. This was something which he had not expected at all. What a wonderful turn of events. He said, don't worry Sairindhri, I'll come. I will come at the appointed time, don't worry. I will try to come and improve what possessions did he realize at that time. He said, I will be there and you also, you go now and we will meet in the evening. I am very happy with your proposal.

And they decided that okay, now whatever happened, Keechaka has to be, his final rites have to be performed. And then Keechaka had many, many followers. And all these followers, they, when they heard the news, they all came and they started making preparations for the cremation of Keechaka. They were all die-hard fans, they were all die-hard loyal servants, followers of Keechaka. When they heard that Sairindhri's Gandharva husband has killed Keechaka. All of these servants, they went to, went in front of King Virata and said, See, we have heard that Sairindhri is the cause of all this, whatever mishappening has taken place. And Keechaka has got killed only because of her. So, we should kill her also, we should not leave her, let her go scot-free. So, please give us permission, we want, when we are doing the final rites of Keechaka, along with him, we want to burn her also to death. Now, these followers of Keechaka were also very strong and powerful, and Keechaka had become very powerful because of them. Now, Keechaka was already killed. Now, Virata was thinking that, who will now protect my kingdom? And now, these are his people, if he does not pacify them, they will turn, they will rebel against him. So, he said, okay, do whatever you want. Now, for the sake of one maidservant, he is not going to jeopardize his own position. So, all these people, the followers of Keechaka, they came. And they forcibly caught hold of Draupadi and started pulling her and taking her away to the crematorium, saying that, because of you, Keechaka desired you, and because of you, he had to meet his death. So, Keechaka is going to be burned, you also go with him.

**Key Quote:** "Like that, she started shouting."
**Summary:** Draupadi is dragged to the crematorium and calls out to her Gandharva husbands using code names, prompting Bhima to spring into action.

So, like that, they started dragging her also to the crematorium. And they started taking the procession of the dead body of Keechaka to the crematorium. Now, Draupadi is in a great anxiety. Now, what will happen to her? She never expected this turn of events. So, now what to do? Then she remembered the code names that they had agreed upon to call each other in case of any great danger. Because she cannot now call out to Bhima. If she calls out to Bhima, their disguise is blown. She cannot call out to Vallabha. She cannot call out to Brihannala. Because if she does that, then again people will start thinking, why is Saiyarindri calling these people? Why are they coming to protect her? Then also their disguise will be blown. So, then she remembered the code names that they had decided upon. And she started calling out, may my Gandharva husbands, Jayanta, Vijaya, Jaya, Jayat Sena, Jayat Bala, let them all, may they protect me from the danger I am in. Otherwise, I will die. Like that, she started shouting. Now, when she started shouting like this, Vallabha, who was in the kitchen or somewhere, he heard her shouting and immediately understood, oh, this is Draupadi's voice and she is in great danger. Now, I have to save her. Now, thinking like this, immediately Bhima sprung into action. Now, what did Bhima do? And was he able to protect Draupadi before she was taken to the crematorium and forcibly put onto the burning pyre of Keechaka? Please join us in the next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the events leading up to Draupadi's near immolation, focusing on Keechaka's death and the subsequent actions of his followers.

Hare Krishna. In the last episode of the Mahabharata, we have seen how Keechaka tried to force himself upon Draupadi and how she found a solution for the problem by engaging Bhima to fight with Keechaka and kill him. This man's hands were imperen moetBe Keechaka point beaut. In the night it was unoccupied and nobody noticed it. AnnSmall and Pandavas cover was also not blown. Keechaka was also taken care of. Draupadi managed to escape from the part of boiling oil. Frau Buddha managed to escape from the pot of boiling oil. She literally fell into the fire, from the frying pan into the fire. What happened after Keechaka's death came to light and people came to know that Keechaka was killed by the Gandharva husband of Sairindhri because he had tried to woo Sairindhri against her wishes. Then Keechaka's followers, they all captured Sairindhri and they decided that when we are cremating Keechaka along with him because Keechaka's last desire was to enjoy Sairindhri, let us put Sairindhri also into the fire and we will take revenge against her for being the cause of the death of our leader, of our commander Keechaka. And so now, literally Draupadi found herself in a position of being pushed into the fire from the frying pan.

#### Pandavas, code names, Bhima's intervention, disguise

**Key Quote:** "So, she called out the code names, Jaya, Vijaya, Jayanta, Jayat Sena, Jayat Bala, like this she called out to them saying that she is in danger."
**Summary:** Draupadi uses pre-arranged code names to call for help, and Bhima, hearing her cries, prepares to rescue her while maintaining their disguise.

Now, what could she do? She called out to the five code names which the Pandavas had discussed amongst themselves which they would call out in case of any danger because at that point of time, she could not call out the original names of the Pandavas. If she did that, their disguise would be blown. And if she called the names by which they were known in Virata, Kanka, Vallabha, Brihannala, Granthika, Tantripala, if she were to call out these names, then also the question would arise how Sairindhri knows them and what is their connection that would again lead to their disguise being blown. So, she called out the code names, Jaya, Vijaya, Jayanta, Jayat Sena, Jayat Bala, like this she called out to them saying that she is in danger. Now, Bhima who was known as Vallabha, he heard Sairindhri's cries for help and he realized what was happening that she was being taken away by the Pandavas. He realized that she was being taken away by Keechaka's, his people. So, what did Bhima do? Bhima wrapped a cloth around his face so that nobody could recognize him like a mask and through a back door, he went out of the kitchen and then through some other path, through some other shortcut, he went to the crematorium where Keechaka's followers were bringing Sairindhri as well as Keechaka. When the followers of Keechaka, dragging Draupadi along and then carrying Keechaka, naturally we can expect they are taking the procession of a dead body. So, they would have passed through various streets in the city because Keechaka was one of the prominent people in the city. He was the commander-in-chief of the army. Naturally, they would have slowly, the procession would have proceeded slowly. They would have given an opportunity for everybody to see him and pay their final respects and all that. So, gradually, slowly they reached the crematorium. When the whole retinue reached the crematorium, they found one huge tall man standing there with one uprooted tree in his hand and wearing a mask around his face who was actually none other than Bhima. And so, these Keechaka's understood that this man is not in a peaceful mood. He is standing in a fighting mood and they guessed who is this man who is stopping our path and they guessed, oh, this must be one of the Gandharva husbands of Sairindhri. Come on, let us kill him also.

**Key Quote:** "In short, in a short period of time Bhima finished all of them."
**Summary:** Bhima single-handedly defeats Keechaka's 300 followers, rescuing Draupadi and then returning unnoticed.

And they took up their arms and they rushed towards this man who was standing like that personified. And these people, the followers of Keechaka were not small in number. Nowadays, when we see some demonstration happening, we see some 10 people gathered together. Media comes and takes their photo from one angle and say there are a lot of protesters and all that. But this was not like that. There were about 300 of them. Not a small number. Big number. And they were all warriors. They all fell upon Bhima with a vengeful spirit because they wanted to avenge the death of their leader. And now Bhima was also not in a, he was not in a conciliatory mood. There was so much pent up fury inside him also. So many years over, they have been living in forest exile and they come to this one, to Virata to live in incognito. So much humiliation. He would not take out his, vent out his frustration and anger. It had all been building up. So now was a great opportunity for Bhima to vent out his frustration and anger built up over almost 13 years. So Bhima also fought furiously with them. And in no time everywhere there were hands, legs, heads strewn around, torsos with, headless torsos. There was blood flowing around. In short, in a short period of time Bhima finished all of them. And then after he killed all of them. Bhima released Sairendri and then he took the shortcut again and unnoticed by anyone he went back to his place in the kitchen. And finally Draupadi as Sairendri she silently walked back to the city. And suddenly the people are seeing that just now this big procession of 300 people they had taken Sairendri with an intention to burn her with Keechaka. And now she is coming back unharmed. And people started questioning what happened? What happened? Then slowly news started coming in that there was this Gandharva husband of Sairendri who came and he has killed all the followers of Keechaka also.

**Summary:** News of Keechaka's death reaches the Kauravas, and Duryodhana becomes suspicious of Draupadi and her 'Gandharva' husbands, fearing they are the Pandavas in disguise.

So they were in the final stage of their exile. Now while all this was going on this news about the death of Keechaka spread everywhere not only within Virata but even to all the neighboring kingdoms also the message started spreading. Soon the news reached Hastinapura. And the Kauravas also came to know like this Keechaka has been killed. Keechaka was a very powerful warrior. And he had avoided the Virata kingdom coming under the subjugation of the Kaurava rulers. So they had always felt that somehow we are not able to subdue him. Now when the news came that Keechaka is dead he is no more. They were all very relieved. Now this very easily King Virata is now weakened. We can subjugate him. Like this they were thinking. Now the news also reached them. About how Keechaka got killed. So when Duryodhana heard that there was this one Sairindhri one maid servant. And she has five Gandharva husbands. And one of the Gandharva husbands killed Keechaka in the middle of the night when nobody was there. He got a little suspicious. Why is it like this? Why would even Gandharvas also don't come and they are not cowards. They will not fight in the dark when nobody is around and all that. Why did they not openly challenge Keechaka and fight with him. Like this some doubt started running in Duryodhana's mind. But more important thing for him. What was occupying his mind was. Less than two weeks were left. For the time of the one year exile of the Pandavas living incognito was getting over.

Now Duryodhana was getting worried. Because all his spies were coming back and saying. That we are not able to find trace of anywhere. Where the Pandavas are there. Now if they finish their period of exile successfully. Then he would have to return their kingdom. Which was never Duryodhana's intention anyway. He always thought very easily. I will be able to discover their disguise. And we will send them another twelve years in forest. He was expecting that. But that's not coming true. And less than two weeks are left. He was in great anxiety about this. So he called all the spies and told them. Put redoubled effort. Put redoubled efforts. Within two weeks I want all of you. Somehow or the other. You have to find out where the Pandavas are. And we have to blow their disguise. We have to uncover their disguise. And we have to send them again into forest exile.

**Key Quote:** "In the Vedic times, every living entity who takes birth in a kingdom is called Praja."
**Summary:** The lecture describes the attack on Virata and the theft of cows, then transitions to a discussion of the king's duty in Vedic civilization to protect all living entities, not just humans.

So. The very next day. The allies of Duryodhana. They attacked the kingdom of Virata. They attacked the kingdom of Virata. And they started taking away his cows. They were at the outskirts of the city. And so the cows had come there for grazing. And the cows are like the citizens of the kingdom. Even the cows are supposed to be given special protection by the kings. In the Vedic civilization, elderly people, women, children, cows and the priestly class of people. These five classes of people had to be given special protection by the king under all circumstances. It was the duty of the king. Not like modern days. In modern days, the government thinks of protection only of the human citizens. They are not bothered about the animals who live in the kingdom. The animals are slain to the slaughterhouse and the human beings should be protected. This is the current day government's policy all over the world. But in the Vedic times, every living entity who takes birth in a kingdom is called Praja. Praja. Jayate. Jayate means to take birth. Whoever takes birth in the kingdom of Jayate. Whoever takes birth in the kingdom of Jayate. Whoever takes birth in the kingdom of Jayate. Quem is left morning, that Timelike. So, he is not allowed to take birth inside his kingdom. Safet Κhilep ruins. Father King. Foods are confiscated. It is important for visitors of the kingdom. So, the person who is allowed to take birth inside the kingdom ofда kingdom, is called the citizen of the kingdom. Singha. So even animals take birth within the kingdom, they also are considered citizens. Citizens in one respect? In respect of the receiving the, having the birth right to receive the protection from the king, from bodily harm and as well as for their welfare activity. Sure not? So it was the duty of the king to protect. Not only human beings but even animals.

**Summary:** Arjuna reveals himself as Brahmanala, leading to Duryodhana's elation due to the terms of the Game of Dice.

And when they were planning to return to the kingdom of Virata the next early morning, Duryodhana and his party attacked the kingdom of Virata. On the other end, in response to which, King Virata's son Bhuminjaya, along with Brahmanala, went to counter that attack. Now that this Brahmanala was Arjuna was unknown to anyone, but Brahmanala revealed to Bhuminjaya when he was completely taken aback by the force of the Kaurava army. Brahmanala revealed to him that he was Arjuna himself. And then Bhuminjaya agreed to become his charioteer. And thus, Brahmanala retrieved the weapons of the Pandavas, which were hidden in the semi-tree next to the crematorium.

**Key Quote:** "And the whole purpose of Duryodhana coming to Virata was that only to uncover the disguise of the Pandavas."
**Summary:** Duryodhana is happy because he thinks the Pandavas will have to return to exile, while Karna boasts about defeating Arjuna.

Now that the disguise of the Pandavas was discovered, Duryodhana became very happy. And why? Because according to the conditions of the Game of Dice, if the Pandavas were discovered during their period of one year of living in incognito, then they would have to go again to the forest in exile for another 12 years. And the whole purpose of Duryodhana coming to Virata was that only: to uncover the disguise of the Pandavas. Now Duryodhana became very happy, and Karna also became very happy, and Bhishma and Dronacharya, they advised Duryodhana that it was unlikely that Arjuna would reveal himself unless the time for the period of their living in incognito was getting over. Duryodhana then told Bhishma Deva, "You please do a calculation and see what is the exact date on which their period of one year living in exile incognito is getting over." In the meantime, Karna started boasting. He told Duryodhana, "Why are you worrying, Duryodhana? The Pandavas have been living in the forest in exile for 12 years. By now, Arjuna would have become very weak, and even if this person who is standing in front of us is really Arjuna, don't worry, very easily with my arrows I'll finish him off today."

**Key Quote:** "Challenging Arjuna to battle if anyone who challenges Arjuna to battle he must really have gone off his senses."
**Summary:** Kripacharya warns Karna about Arjuna's power, and Ashwatthama criticizes Karna's lack of battlefield achievements.

When Kripacharya heard Karna boasting like this, he told Karna, "What are you talking about? Living in 12 years of exile in the forest, Arjuna and his brothers were not sitting idly. They were doing many austerities and penances, so they would have become all the more powerful. And as it is, we all know that Arjuna is far more powerful than you are." Then Kripacharya reminded him, "Look at when the Gandharvas attacked Duryodhana, it was Arjuna who defeated all of them and brought back Duryodhana." So at that time, Karna had got defeated. Karna got very angry. He said, "One instance like that, something happened, but today you will see my arrows will lay Arjuna down on the battlefield." Then he continued his boasting and he said, "Don't worry, come on, let us fight him." Kripacharya looked at him and he said, "You are talking of fighting Arjuna? You have gone mad. Challenging Arjuna to battle, if anyone who challenges Arjuna to battle, he must really have gone off his senses. It's like a man thinking of tying a heavy stone around his neck and trying to swim the ocean, not possible, the guy will drown, or it is like a man with his bare fingers trying to take out the poisonous fangs of a snake, it will only kill him. So like that, you are trying to rush into battle with Arjuna, you've gone off your head. Even if all six of us together, Bhishma, Dronacharya, myself, Kripacharya, Karna, you, Duryodhana, all of us together combined, if we fight against Arjuna, we may stand a slim chance, that also you cannot say with certainty where we may be able to counter Arjuna, but that also no guarantee, and you are saying that you want to fight him all by yourself?" When Ashwatthama heard this, he also jumped in. He said, "Karna, you are only used to boasting all the time. Where have you proven yourself in battle? Did you win the game of dice? In which fight with other kings did you win Draupadi, that you pulled her into the assembly and gave the great idea of disrobing

her in the middle of the assembly? In which battle did you ever fight the Pandavas and win? You have never really won any battle on ground and proven your words. You are simply going on boasting, that's it." Now Karna became very upset and insulted, but he wouldn't say anything because whatever Kripacharya was saying and whatever Ashwatthama was saying, both of them are actually correct. And then Bhishma Deva had to pacify everyone. And then Bhishma Deva spoke up and he said, "No, no, don't worry. Ashwatthama, Karna said like that so that we would all become enthused to fight against Arjuna. Otherwise, we are all talking only of Arjuna's prowess and we are not thinking of fighting him. So he wanted to encourage us and to inspire us to fight. He spoke those words, so don't take it too badly. Whatever you have spoken is correct, whatever Kripacharya spoke is also correct, but let us not insult or fight amongst ourselves." So then Dronacharya and Kripacharya also said, "Okay, whatever happened, let us now think of how to face the Arjuna who is standing before us." And then Bhishma told Duryodhana, "I've done my calculations. The one year of living incognito which the Pandavas had to complete got over yesterday, so today that is why Arjuna has revealed himself." Now Duryodhana, when

he heard this, he was mortified, but now there was nothing he could do. Then Dronacharya told Duryodhana, "Do one thing, you take all these cows which were belonging to the kingdom of Virata, you take them and you go. We will somehow try to stop Arjuna, so because Duryodhana is the prince and his life should not be put into danger." So the other Kaurava soldiers, the Kaurava army, Dushasana and other brothers of Duryodhana, Bhishma Dev, Dronacharya, Ashwatthama, Kripacharya, all these people took up their formations in the battle to face Arjuna because Arjuna had already blown his conch. And then Duryodhana, in the meantime, he started taking away the cows. Now Arjuna shot two arrows and those two arrows came and landed at the feet of Dronacharya and Bhishma Dev and Kripacharya. And then Dronacharya and Bhishma Dev looked at it and they said, "Arjuna is sending his respects, but now having submitted his respects, now he is not going to hold back, so let us get ready." So all of them got ready and in the meantime Arjuna saw how Duryodhana's chariot was moving away. Immediately he understood the plan of the Kauravas and he told Bhuminjaya, "Look, look, look, Duryodhana is trying to get away, let us go and corner him." So immediately Bhuminjaya, instead of going into the cover of army, took it off on a detour and cut off

Duryodhana. And Arjuna also used his arrows to quickly cut off Duryodhana. And Duryodhana did not have the courage to face Arjuna alone in battle. And when he saw that Arjuna's chariot was coming towards him, he dropped his plans of trying to get away all by himself. And he went back and joined the ranks of the Kauravas, thinking that, "I stand a better chance when I'm in the midst of Bhishma Dev and Dronacharya and Karna." And so the cows also, Duryodhana could not hold them back, and they all went back into the kingdom of Virata. So now the Virata kingdom's cows had been protected. Now Arjuna came back to the battlefield. And then Karna immediately jumped into the battle. And he started abusing Arjuna, saying that, "Oh, Arjuna, today you will see my arrows will wound you and they will kill you and you will lie on the battlefield," and so on and so forth, as Karna was usually always. He engaged in boasting. Similarly, he continued in the same way. Arjuna did not hold back. Arjuna started releasing his arrows. Karna also started releasing his arrows, and both of them engaged in a pitched battle. But gradually, Arjuna's superiority came to the fore. Slowly, Karna got wounded everywhere. His bow was broken. His arrows had pierced his arms, his thighs, his chest. And finally, he told his charioteer, "I cannot stand fighting Arjuna." So he had to run away from the battle. And then when Karna was beaten

back like this, then Dronacharya came forward. And when Dronacharya came forward, Arjuna told him that, "Oh, my guru, you are my guru. I will not take up a weapon against you unless you draw the weapon first." So Dronacharya smiled and he drew his bow and released his arrow. And when Dronacharya released his arrow, then Arjuna started counterattacking. So the fight went on between them, the guru and Arjuna. Dronacharya, of course, his full heart was not there in the battle, so he was not exerting himself fully. So very quickly, Arjuna managed to overpower him. And Dronacharya being hit by the arrows of Arjuna fainted. And when Dronacharya's charioteer saw that Dronacharya has fainted, he took him away from the battlefield. Now came forth Bhishmadeva, Arjuna. Now, between Bhishmadeva and Arjuna also, the fight started in good earnest. And because of the Kshatriya spirit, both of them were in a really angry mood and they were exchanging arrows. But again, even Bhishmadeva also could not face, he could not counter all of Arjuna's weapons. And Bhishmadeva also soon, he fell unconscious and his chariot also had to be taken away. Now, Karna had recuperated and he jumped back into the battle. And he came in front of Arjuna again, and again, he started fighting. But very quickly, again, he was defeated. Again, he had to run back from the battle. So like this, the battle between the Kaurava army and Arjuna went back and forth. And on this side, Arjuna was all alone. And on the other side, all these Maharashtris, the great generals, Kripacharya, Ashwatthama himself, Dronacharya, Bhishmadeva, all these people, Dushyasana, and

all these people fighting against Arjuna, but none of them were able to overpower him. Finally, Duryodhana himself came forward and started fighting. Now, Arjuna very quickly and very easily defeated Duryodhana, but he did not want to kill him because he remembered Bhima's vow to kill all of Duryodhana and his brothers. So he did not kill him, but he very quickly destroyed his bow and all his arrows. Everything got exhausted, and Duryodhana had also to retreat. So finally, when the entire Kaurava army was beaten back like this, the Kaurava army decided that we will not be able to face Arjuna, let us go back. And so all of them left the battlefield and went back to Hastinapura. So we can see how Arjuna was so powerful. All these warriors together could not face Arjuna in battle. But Arjuna did not pursue them. Arjuna, on the other hand, now that they had been defeated and they had left the kingdom of Virata, he collected all the, what it as the general practice used to be, he collected all the gold and the various ornaments of the dead soldiers who were lying on the battlefield and he gave it to Bhuminjaya and he told him that, "When we go back to the kingdom of Virata, don't tell anyone that I am Arjuna and I am the one who fought the battle and won it. You tell that you won it. At the right time, we will inform everyone who I am." Bhuminjaya agreed. He said, "Arjuna, you are my superior, whatever you command me, I will follow." So Brahmanala again occupied the post of the charioteer and Bhuminjaya sat on the chariot and both of them

And when King Virata heard that his son Bhuminjaya had gone all alone into the battle with the Kauravas with just the eunuch Brahmanala for his charioteer, he got alarmed. He said, "My poor son, what will we stand against the Kauravas? He'll be slaughtered." And he immediately readied his troops and he said, "Come, let us go immediately to save my son." By that time, messengers came and Bhuminjaya himself came to the court and he told Virata that the Kauravas had been defeated and they had gone back. And King Virata was extremely pleased and he was surprised, "Oh, my dear son Bhuminjaya, you are so powerful, you have defeated the Kauravas?" Then Bhuminjaya, now he could not tell that it was Arjuna who had fought because he had given his word, so he said, "No, no, no, I did not fight the battle. I actually, I wanted to run away from the battle, but suddenly when I was trying to flee from the battle, seeing the great strength of the Kaurava army and the powerful fighters like Bhishma, Drona, Duryodhana, Karna, and others, at that time a celestial being came and that celestial being, that devata, helped me to fight the Kauravas and it was that devata who actually defeated all the Kauravas." So then King Virata asked Bhuminjaya, "Where is that devata? Did you not bring him along with you?" Well, this hill is now being looted by the golemas. So Bhuminjaya said, "No, I don't know where he has gone. So I am unable to tell where he has gone. I don't know where he came from and where he went." Anyway, King Virata was very happy that now his kingdom had been protected and double celebration from two sides. The kingdom was attacked, but however, even the devata seemed to be helping King Virata and protecting himself, although Kichaka, who was his commander, was now no more.

**Summary:** The Pandavas reveal their true identities to King Virata, who is shocked and happy to have hosted them.

And like that, the evening was spent. The next day morning, King Virata came to the assembly and he sat down on his throne. And when he was sitting on his throne, suddenly he saw five young Kshatriyas clad in silk and wearing all gold ornaments walking into his assembly. And he saw, "These people seem to be familiar. Oh, this is Kanka and this is Vallabha, my cook, and there is Granthika and this is Tantripala, the guy who was taking care of my horses, and here is, looks like this person, somewhere I have seen this person, the fifth guy, I am not able to place him." Then he said that, "Arre Kanka, Vallaba, all of you, how come you are dressed like Kshatriyas and you are walking into my court in such a regal manner, not like the earlier way used to be?" And then they all introduced themselves and they said that King Yudhishthira introduced himself and he said, "I am Yudhishthira and we are all the Pandavas. So, and this is Bhima, this is Nakula, this is Sahadeva." Then Virata said, "Who is this other person?" "This is Arjuna who was here as Brihannala." Everybody in the court was taken by surprise. They were all shocked. And Virata said, "Oh my God, this one year you people have been staying here. Sir, always I used to think that somewhere I have seen you, but I couldn't place you. How could I ever not recognize you people? I just, I am not able to understand. Anyway, I am very happy that all of you were there here." And King Virata was a close friend of Yudhishthira. He respected the Pandavas a lot. And so he was very happy that the Pandavas had stayed with him for one year, although he had not recognized them. And then the Pandavas introduced Draupadi also. And they said, "This is Draupadi."

**Summary:** The Pandavas reveal Draupadi's identity and the story of Keechaka, and King Virata feels guilty for mistreating the Pandavas and offers his daughter Uttara in marriage to Arjuna.

Draupadi, she was here serving your wife, Queen Sudeshna, as the Sairindri maid servant. And then they also informed King Virata that Keechaka had lustfully approached Draupadi and it was Bhima who had killed Keechaka. Anyway, Keechaka was not such a great popular guy, and Virata also did not have such, he did not have great affection for him. But then out of necessity, out of helplessness, Keechaka had to tolerate him, so he didn't bother that Keechaka was no more. And on the other hand, King Virata was very happy with the Pandavas. And then he thought, "All you Pandavas, you are all highly glorified and exalted devotees of Krishna, but I have engaged you as servants in my palace, in my kingdom, so I feel very guilty." The Pandavas had no such feeling because the Pandavas themselves had wanted such a position to live incognito. So they were not, they had not taken it otherwise. But King Virata remembered all those instances during their relationships when he would order them to do this, do that, just like he would order any other servants. And so he felt guilty that he had mistreated the Pandavas. And so he said, he offered that my daughter Uttara, I want to give her in marriage to Arjuna.

that my daughter Uttara, I want to give her in marriage to Arjuna. Now Arjuna immediately responded, "No, no, no, how can that be possible? I have been her teacher, so as a teacher, I am in the position of her father. I cannot marry her. And if I marry her today, people will speak ill of our relationship. We have had no illicit connection between ourselves till date and we have had just the very, very respectable relationship of a guru and a disciple because as Brahmanala, Arjuna was her guru for dance." And so Arjuna said, "But if you want to establish such family relationship with our dynasty, then I have a grown-up son, Abhimanyu, who is about 16 years old now. He is more or less of the same age as Uttara. If you want, we can marry both of them." Being Brahmanala was extremely happy and satisfied and he said, "Oh, this is a very nice proposal from your side and I am ready for this." So from this we can see the unimpeachable character of Arjuna. Although Uttara was offered to him, he saw her just as his own daughter, even though he had moved with her very intimately, taught her the art of dance, and in teaching of the art of dance, very close interactions would have been there, but his heart had entertained no

**Key Quote:** "And in this manner the marriage of Uttara and Abhimanyu was conducted in the kingdom of Virata."
**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the events of the previous episode, including the Pandavas' emergence from disguise, Arjuna's victory, and the marriage of Uttara and Abhimanyu, leading to a discussion about reclaiming Indraprastha.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode, we have seen how the Pandavas have come out of their living one year in the kingdom of Virata under disguise, incognito. And having completed their one year term, Brahman Nala revealed himself to be Arjuna to all the Kauravas who had come to attack the kingdom of Virata, and they were all defeated by Arjuna all alone, and they had to go back empty handed. And after that, we have seen the unimpeachable character of Arjuna when King Virata, coming to know of the real identity of the Pandavas, he offered his daughter Uttara in marriage to Arjuna. Arjuna, having been her teacher, very clearly said that he was in the role of her father, and he could not marry her, and instead, it was decided that Arjuna's son Abhimanyu will marry Uttara. And in this manner, the marriage of Uttara and Abhimanyu was conducted in the kingdom of Virata. And many people had come to attend it, even King Drupada had come, Krishna and Balarama had come. So like this, all of them had assembled there, and after the wedding celebrations, they all got together to discuss on the next steps to take back the kingdom of Indraprastha back from the Kauravas.

#### Duryodhana, Shakuni, Deceit, Character

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana was always seeing how to not keep his promise and this was Duryodhana's natural, his evil-minded character"
**Summary:** The segment describes Duryodhana's reaction to the Pandavas' completion of their exile, Shakuni's attempt to manipulate the timeline, and Duryodhana's inherent deceitful nature.

So what their discussions led to is what we will look at today. Before we get there, what had happened after the Kauravas returned to Hastinapura? Duryodhana was despondent about how they had been defeated by Arjuna, and not only that, as told by Bhishma Deva, the period of the Pandavas living incognita had gotten over just the previous day, so they had by a whisker missed that opportunity to expose the disguise of the Pandavas, by which they could have been sent for another 12 years of forest exile. So while Dushasana, Karna, Shakuni, and Duryodhana, all these people were mulling over what had happened, Shakuni came up with a convoluted calculation by which he proved, or seemed to prove, that the Pandavas had actually not completed their one year of living incognito. So armed with this fresh explanation or twist given by Shakuni, Duryodhana got back a little bit of his confidence that there was some grounds on which they could reject giving back the Indraprastha kingdom to the Pandavas. So they knew that sooner or later, the Pandavas are going to come asking for their kingdom back, so we have some grounds to now refuse them. So like this, Duryodhana had already started preparing his mind as well as his followers about what should be the response and how to prevent giving back Indraprastha to the Pandavas. We can see how the Pandavas were always very steadfast in following whatever word of honour they had given, whereas Duryodhana was always seeing how to not keep his promise, and this was Duryodhana's natural, his evil-minded character.

**Summary:** The discussion among Krishna, Balarama, and others in Virata begins, with Krishna suggesting sending an emissary to demand the return of Indraprastha, warning of war if refused.

character, which was shared by Shakuni, Karna, and Dushasana and all his other brothers. Now when in the kingdom of Virata, when the Pandavas and Krishna and Balaram, Drupada and all these people assembled together, they started discussing on the next course of action. Lord Krishna, he spoke up and said that, we all know that Yudhishthira Maharaj is always situated in virtuosity. He will never abandon the path of virtue. Now that they have rightfully completed their term of 13 years in exile, 12 years in the forest and 1 year incognito, they have all the right to go back and get back their kingdom of Indraprastha. So we should send an emissary to ask for a return of the kingdom of Indraprastha to the Pandavas and the message should be clear that in case they refuse to give back the kingdom of Indraprastha to the Pandavas, then war would be inevitable.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Balarama, however, took an opposite approach and he said we should take a conciliatory approach."
**Summary:** Balarama advocates for a conciliatory approach, while Satyaki argues for readiness for war, highlighting the differing opinions within the assembly.

Now this, whatever Lord Krishna said, was echoed by others in the assembly. Lord Balarama, however, took an opposite approach and he said we should take a conciliatory approach. We should approach them humbly and if we go with an aggressive attitude, it may not be conducive. After all, ultimately, Yudhishthira Maharaj also made a mistake in playing the game of dice when he was not expert at it. So like this, Balarama gave an opposite view, which was countered by Satyaki, who was the commander-in-chief of Lord Krishna's army of the Yadavas. And he countered Balarama and he gave a more favorable argument for the Pandavas saying that Duryodhana's nature was such that we cannot expect him to return the kingdom, so we should be ready for war. So after all these back and forth discussions were going on, some were in favor of peace, some were in favor of approaching Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra in a humble mood, others were saying no, we should take a strong approach and all those kind of things. Finally, Drupada Maharaj spoke up and being an elderly person, being astute in the matters of political affairs, his word carried a lot of weight.

**Key Quote:** "So I suggest, Drupada said, I suggest that I have my priest who is a qualified Brahmana, very austere, lives very simply, is very truthful, very humble, so this kind of person if he send to the Duryodhana."
**Summary:** Drupada proposes sending a priest as a messenger to gauge the mood in Hastinapura before making any decisions, a suggestion that is agreed upon by the assembly.

So Drupada Maharaj said that I feel, I suggest that what we should do is, we should gauge the mood in Hastinapura. We should gauge the atmosphere. We should gauge the mood of Duryodhana as well as Dhritarashtra and others before we come to any conclusion about what is the next step we should take. Suppose by chance Duryodhana is agreeable to return the kingdom because of the influence of Vidura, Bhishma and all those things, then we have achieved our end. We don't have to create any hostilities. On the other hand, if Duryodhana continues his inimical attitude, then we have to take steps to assemble our people. We have to build up our army and all those things because Duryodhana is quite powerful. So we should start talking to our allies, we have to build up our army also. So unless we have, we know what is his mood, we will not be able to do, we will not be able to take the right decision. So I suggest, Drupada said, I suggest that I have my priest who is a qualified Brahmana, very austere, lives very simply, is very truthful, very humble, so this kind of person if he send to the Duryodhana. The assembly of Hastinapura, everyone will respectfully receive him and because he is very intelligent, he will be able to assess the mood of the people and give us the right pulse of what is happening there. Then when everybody heard this, everybody was in agreement with whatever Drupada said and they said, yes, what you are saying is absolutely right. Let us go ahead with this plan. Then Lord Krishna and Balarama informed the Pandavas as well as Drupada Maharaj. So you please go ahead with your plan. Whatever help you need. In case there is war, we are with you. So don't worry. So we will go back to Dwaraka and wait to hear what happened to the messenger going and coming back because for the messenger to go from the kingdom of Virata to Hastinapura, meet all the Kauravas there, come back with his message, it will all take time. So in the meantime, we will proceed to Dwaraka.

**Key Quote:** "So your goal in going there should be twofold. One is we should assess what is the mood in their camp?"
**Summary:** Drupada instructs his priest on how to deliver the message to the Kauravas, emphasizing the need to assess the situation and create dissension within their ranks if necessary.

Like this Krishna and Balarama left for Dwaraka and Drupada Maharaj called his priest, his Purohit and he spoke to him. He told him, see, this is what we want. You have to approach the Kauravas with a message from the Pandavas. Now this message, Drupada Maharaj using his worldly wise wisdom, he told the Purohit that we have to, how the message has to be positioned. So he told the Purohit, it is unlikely that Duryodhana will be agreeable to return the kingdom of the Pandavas. Then what is the point? What is the point in going there? So your goal in going there should be twofold. One is we should assess what is the mood in their camp? What steps are they taking? Are they preparing for war or are they remaining quite normal and peaceful? So that is one thing that you have to assess. Another thing that you have to also assess is that, another thing that you also have to achieve is that in case Duryodhana is refusing. If Duryodhana is refusing or Duryodhana is refusing is disagreeable to peace then you have to speak in such a way explaining how Dharma is on the side of the Pandavas so that people who are good people in that assembly of the Kauravas such as Bhishma, Drona, Kripacharya, Vidura, all these people, they will differ from the view of Duryodhana and so we would have created dissension in their camp, which will bring down their morale. So this is one of the age old myths. I will tell you later. About the Parachuram techniques of political craft, which Drupada Maharaj was using, Sama, Dama, Danda, Veda, if Sama, Dama, Danda doesn't work, you have to use Veda, if you create division in the camp of the enemy, you have broken his strength, so Drupada Maharaj advised his

**Key Quote:** "The Brahmana also mentioned to the assembly addressing Dhritarashtra that the Pandavas want peace."
**Summary:** The priest travels to Hastinapura, observes the military preparations, and delivers the Pandavas' message, emphasizing their desire for peace and the importance of Dharma.

Purohit, so these are the two things he had to achieve and sent him to the assembly of Hastinapura, this Brahmana, he travelled all the way to Hastinapura, took him quite a few days, he reached Hastinapura, when he reached Hastinapura, he noticed that Duryodhana had started assembling an army, he had started sending messages to his known people, his allies, his friends and started intimating them that we have to prepare for war with the Pandavas, so you send your army to Hastinapura and we have to start assembling an army, so we have to start building our forts, so the Brahmana could see that, okay, this, this thing is, this army is building up, so he made his way and entered the court of Hastinapura and when everybody came to know that he is a messenger coming from the kingdom of Virata and he is the Purohit of Drupada, he was well received, respectfully and after all suitable procedures had been completed, formalities had been completed with respect to his welcoming, they asked him what message he had brought. Now this priest, he started explaining how the Pandavas had been cheated in that game of dice, how against the principles of Dharma, Duryodhana, Karna and others had tried to disrobe Draupadi and by way of use of cheating methods, Yudhishthira was unwilling to participate in that game of dice. He was forced to participate and unrighteously he was defeated in the game of dice and sent on the, on, on, into the forest in exile. And now that the Pandavas had completed their term according to the, to the promise that they had given, now according to the principles of Dharma, Indraprastha has to be returned to the Pandavas, otherwise according to the principles of the Dharma, Pandavas will be left with no other option than to declare war.

**Key Quote:** "The Brahmana also mentioned to the assembly addressing Dhritarashtra that the Pandavas want peace."
**Summary:** The priest conveys the Pandavas' desire for peace, Bhishma supports the Pandavas' claim, while Karna vehemently opposes it, displaying his arrogance and defiance.

The Brahmana also mentioned that the Pandavas want peace. They are not interested in a war. That is not what they want. So therefore, please return the kingdom of Indraprastha and they will promise that they will forget all their past hostilities, whatever humiliation they have undergone, they will forget all that and live peacefully in cooperation with the Kaurava dynasty. Now, when the assembly heard this, then Bhishma Deva started speaking and Bhishma Deva said, yes, what you have said is absolutely right. Dharma is fully on the side of the Pandavas. Whatever they had to undergo due to the cheating and due to the evil machinations of Duryodhana and Karna and Shakuni and others, now the time has come that we should return Indraprastha and seek forgiveness from them. So, please return the kingdom of Indraprastha. And once again, he was talking about the power of Arjuna and his Gandiva as well as the power of Bhima's mace. So it would not behove us to engage in battle with them in any manner. We stand no chance in front of them. So, when Bhishma spoke these kind of words, Karna could not tolerated because Karna was always very arrogant and he had a he was very conceited he had a very high estimation. An unjustifiably high estimation of himself. So he got up and he started speaking very angrily. What are you talking, oh brahmana? What do you think of yourself? The point of us are coming from exile? What what do they think of themselves according to us there? They have not completed their term of the for the living incognito one year. So they should simply give up everything and go back to 12 years of forest exile. After that let them come back and request us and if Duryodhana is pleased he will return the kingdom to them. Otherwise the Duryodhana will not give them even an inch of land, forget it. We are not interested in giving anything.

**Key Quote:** "He told the brahmana that please take our message back to the Pandavas. We want peace"
**Summary:** Dhritarashtra responds to the priest, expressing a desire for peace but avoiding any commitment to return Indraprastha, revealing his ambiguous stance.

Like this Karna spoke up very strongly. When Karna spoke like this Dronacharya, Bhishma, they, Vidura, they all censured him, while Dushasana and others, they said, oh, what Karna has said is right and all these kind of things. Then Duryodhana spoke something, Dhritarashtra spoke something, finally Dhritarashtra gave the final verdict. He told the brahmana that please take our message back to the Pandavas. We want peace. We don't want war. So please tell them whatever is required for peace. Let us work cooperatively and let us achieve that. Let us not engage in any sort of hostility and also please tell them that if we engage in war, it is going to be only destruction of our own family. So let us not do this. So like this Dhritarashtra very tactfully he gave a message as if he is wanting peace, but he never gave a commitment that they will return Indraprastha and so like this the brahmana also understood what Dhritarashtra's mind was, what was the mood of Duryodhana, Karna and others and what was happening in Hastinapura and he returned back to the kingdom of Virata with the news. Now when he brought back the news, he told what exactly had happened and he told that the Dhritarashtra's message is that they want peace, but he has given no commitment of returning the kingdom of Indraprastha.

**Summary:** Drupada analyzes the information brought back by the priest, noting the discrepancy between Dhritarashtra's words and the military preparations, and advises the Pandavas to prepare for war and gather allies.

And he also explained what kind of army they were gathering and what kind of military preparations were going on in Hastinapura which he witnessed with on with his own eyes and Drupada also started gathering that information about the strength of the enemy army so Duryodhana was quite crafty and he was quite experienced so he had he achieved what he wanted to do he he wanted an estimation of the kind of military activity that was happening in Hastinapura and he managed to get what he wanted and so then he told the Pandavas see this although he Dhritarashtra is saying he wants peace, but the activity suggests otherwise so we should also not keep quiet. We should immediately start informing our allies and we should start getting people on our side. Let us immediately send out messengers from our side and ask our allies to come and join us. The Pandavas also agreed. Yes. This is a good strategy to adopt. We should not waste any more time and immediately Drupada started sending out messengers in different directions to those who are friendly to the Pandavas and they knew that they would join them in the in the fight of righteousness. In the meantime, Dhritarashtra also told one more thing to this brahmana. He told them please give us a little time. We will think over and give our final conclusion. We will the final message will send through one of our messengers after a little while. So the Pandavas also said okay while we assemble we are while we gather our military strength also, let us wait for the final messenger to come from the side of the dhritarashtra.

**Summary:** Dhritarashtra is in a dilemma, unable to go against Duryodhana's wishes, and decides to send Sanjaya with a message to the Pandavas, setting the stage for the next episode.

So they were waiting what Dhritarashtra would do. The dhritarashtra thought over for some time. He consulted Vidura. He consulted Bhishma. They were all naturally in favor of the Pandavas and telling him to return the kingdom of Indraprastha to the Pandavas, whereas Duryodhana was totally against it. Duryodhana was not interested in giving back anything. Duryodhana was sticking to his stand that the Pandavas have not completed their one year of living incognito, so they have to go back to their 12 year of exile. So he was, Duryodhana continued to be unreasonable and Dhritarashtra did not have the guts. He did not have the courage to go against Duryodhana. So he was being overwhelmed by what Duryodhana was saying. At the same time, Dhritarashtra knew that although Karna was so boasting and all those kind of things, Karna was not going to be able to protect Duryodhana. Although Duryodhana also had great faith in Karna's prowess, but Dhritarashtra had a good, good idea. He had a proper understanding of the reality and he knew that if there was a war, all his sons would be killed. So now what to do? He was, Dhritarashtra was in a dilemma. He could not go against his son Duryodhana and return the kingdom to the Pandavas in which case the war could be fully averted. At the same time, he did not want the war. Now what to do? So he thought of sending Sanjaya with a message to the Pandavas who were living in Virata. Now, what was that message which Dhritarashtra sent through Sanjaya and what was the response of the Pandavas to this? Please join us in our next episode to know about this. Thank you. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, highlighting Duryodhana's refusal to return Indraprastha, Shakuni's calculations, and Dhritarashtra's attempt to broker peace through Sanjaya.

Hare Krishna. In the last episode of the Mahabharata, we have seen how Drupada Maharaj sent his priest as a messenger to Hastinapura to convey their intent and requesting the Kauravas to return Indraprastha to the Pandavas, while also assessing what was the mood of the Kauravas and what all preparations they were undertaking. And we also saw how the Kauravas were completely against returning the kingdom to Indraprastha. Duryodhana, being the envious, greedy person that he was, he had no intention of returning the kingdom. Shakuni had made his own calculations, some convoluted calculations he had done to convince others that the Pandavas had not yet completed their term of exile, living incognito, before they were discovered. And on that basis, they should be asked to go back for another 12 years of forest exile. Although in reality, just as Bhishma Dev had done his calculations, the Pandavas had completed their exile period successfully. Then after this, Dhritarashtra thought of sending Sanjaya, who was his charioteer and his personal secretary, to the Pandavas with a message which he, after hearing out Duryodhana and understanding his intentions, that he did not want to return the kingdom of Indraprastha. So Dhritarashtra wanted to send a message which would not be hostile, which would not incite war, but at the same time somehow broker peace. That was Dhritarashtra's thinking. So what did Sanjaya convey to the Pandavas? What was the message he took to them? What was their reaction?

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana had already started intimating his allies, gathering different armies, and he was building up his army very well aware that his refusal to return Indraprastha to the Pandavas, which was rightfully theirs, would inevitably result in war."
**Summary:** The segment describes Krishna and Balarama's return to Dwaraka, Duryodhana's awareness of the impending war, and his plan to seek the support of the invincible Yadava army.

Is what we will see today. In the meantime, what had happened was, when after the marriage of Uttara and Abhimanyu, when all the kings had got together and they were strategizing what should be the next steps to be taken, and they finally decided to send Drupada's priest to Hastinapura to seek a return of the Pandavas' kingdom, Lord Krishna and Balarama had returned to Dwaraka, giving confidence to the Pandavas that whenever they would be needed, they would be there. This news that Krishna had returned to Dwaraka reached Hastinapura. Now Duryodhana had already started intimating his allies, gathering different armies, and he was building up his army very well aware that his refusal to return Indraprastha to the Pandavas, which was rightfully theirs, would inevitably result in war. Now the Yadava Sainya, which was called Narayani Sainya, it was known to be an army which was invincible. The Narayani Sena of Krishna had defeated Jarasandha innumerable number of times. They had defeated Shalva, and many such battles had been very easily won by the Narayani Sena. And all over the world, everybody knew that the Yadava army was practically invincible. Now it was Duryodhana also knew that Krishna always was favorable towards the Pandavas. So he thought, let me quickly go to Dwaraka and seek the support of the Yadava army. While to all other allies, Duryodhana had sent his different emissaries to seek the support of the different kings. When it came to the Yadava army, because it was so important, Duryodhana personally went to Dwaraka.

#### Duryodhana's arrival at Dwaraka, Krishna's influence, Arjuna's arrival

**Key Quote:** "Although Ugrasena was the king of the Yadavas, still Krishna's word was always considered final."
**Summary:** Duryodhana arrives in Dwaraka seeking Krishna's support, knowing Krishna's influence over the Yadavas, and coincidentally meets Arjuna who has come for the same reason.

Duryodhana came to Dwaraka and he informed the people there that he had come to meet Lord Krishna because he knew, although Ugrasena was the king of the Yadavas, still Krishna's word was always considered final in the Yadava assembly. So he thought it is wise to meet Krishna and if he seeks Krishna's support and Krishna agrees, then all the rest of the entire Yadava clan would definitely support him. So with this intention, Duryodhana had come to Dwaraka. In the meantime, what had happened is, before Duryodhana came to Dwaraka, Satyaki, one of the commander-in-chiefs of the Yadava army, he was a disciple of Arjuna. He had learnt the art of archery from Arjuna himself and he was always very much in favour of the Pandavas because of their righteousness. Satyaki, without waiting for an invitation from the Pandavas, took one Akshauhini, one division of army and went to Virata, the kingdom of Virata and he joined the Pandavas. Now the rest of the Yadava clan was still in Dwaraka by the time Duryodhana had reached Dwaraka and now when Duryodhana came and sought audience with Krishna, he was told that Krishna was taking rest within his chambers and so he was escorted, Duryodhana was escorted towards Krishna's chambers. Because Duryodhana, the entire Kaurava dynasty were closely related with the Yadava dynasty because Kunti Devi was from the Yadava dynasty and therefore she was the aunt of Lord Krishna and that way the relationship was quite thick between the Yadava household and the Kaurava household. So therefore, Duryodhana had access to Krishna's private chambers. When Duryodhana arrived, it so happened that Krishna was actually resting. He was sleeping in his inner chambers and because he was a close family member, he was escorted to Krishna's bedroom. As Duryodhana was entering Krishna's bedroom, he saw there was one more visitor who had arrived at the same time. It was none other than Arjuna. Arjuna had also come seeking the support of Krishna practically at the same time. Now Duryodhana and Arjuna saw each other, they greeted each other and Duryodhana entered first into Krishna's chamber because he had come first and also he was the elder one, Arjuna was younger. Giving due respect according to his age, Arjuna followed Duryodhana into the chamber.

**Key Quote:** "You came here first. But when I opened my eyes, the first person I saw was Arjuna."
**Summary:** Krishna, upon waking, greets both Duryodhana and Arjuna and offers them a choice: himself unarmed or his entire Narayani Sena, giving Arjuna the first opportunity to choose.

As soon as Duryodhana entered, he saw Krishna lying on the bedstead and next to Krishna near his head was a small chair. Duryodhana went and sat there at Krishna's head waiting for him to wake up. Arjuna in the meantime, he also entered and he saw Krishna is sleeping and he went and stood very respectfully at the lotus feet of Krishna. Arjuna, he is a great devotee of Lord Krishna, and for him his heart is filled with love for Krishna. Yes, he understands the great position of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So he felt it appropriate to stand at the lotus feet of Krishna. And both Duryodhana and Arjuna were silently waiting, not wanting to disturb the sleep of Krishna. After a little while, Krishna slowly opened his eyes. And when Krishna opened his eyes, he saw Arjuna standing at his feet. And then slowly Krishna raised himself up and he said, Oh Arjuna, you have come here. And then when Krishna got up and sat up on his bed, he saw Duryodhana is sitting next to him. And he said, Oh Duryodhana, you have also come. Then Krishna greeted both of them warmly and he asked them, Why have you both come at the same time together? At the same time to meet me? Then Duryodhana replied to Krishna and he said, Oh my dear Krishna, we both have come here seeking your support and the support of your Yadava army for any eventuality of any war that may take place between us. And you are related to the Kaurava dynasty. So you are equally related to me as well as to the Pandavas. Therefore, you should be equal to both of us. And since I have come here first, therefore I have the right to first ask your support. Lord Krishna replied to Duryodhana, My dear Duryodhana, I agree what you have said is right. You came here first. But when I opened my eyes, the first person I saw was Arjuna. Not only that, Arjuna is younger to you by age. And according to the Vedic scriptures, according to Dharma, the younger person is always given the first opportunity. And so therefore, I give Arjuna the opportunity to seek my support. But at the same time, what you have said is right, Duryodhana, that I am related equally to both of you. This is a family quarrel. And so, what I will do is, on one side, I present myself unarmed. I will not take up arms in the battle. I will not fight in the battle. But I will be there giving good advice and support. Moral support and advice will be there from my side. On the other hand, my entire Narayani Sena, the Yadavasanya will be available. So between the two of you, you can choose one of these two. And Arjuna, I give you the first opportunity.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna, doesn't matter that you don't lift arms, you don't do any activity, you just be by my side. That's enough for me."
**Summary:** Arjuna chooses Krishna over the army, expressing his deep devotion and prioritizing Krishna's presence above all else.

Please choose whom you want. Arjuna, without batting an eyelid, without hesitation, immediately said, Krishna, doesn't matter that you don't lift arms, you don't do any activity, you just be by my side. That's enough for me. Krishna said, okay, as you wish. Then he turned to Duryodhana and he said, Arjuna has chosen me. So I am afraid that you have to be satisfied with the Narayana. So I am afraid that you have to be satisfied with the Narayani Sena. Duryodhana, internally, was delighted. He had thought that oh, Arjuna has got the first right, he will choose the Narayani Sena and I will be left with Krishna who is anyway not going to lift weapons. What is the point of having him then anyway on our side? Duryodhana was elated that Arjuna had made the foolish decision. And he thought, good, Arjuna has somehow, by some fluke, Arjuna has chosen wrongly. So Duryodhana, but externally, he was a greatly diplomatic person. He maintained a very calm exterior and neutral countenance he maintained. And he said, I think I don't have a choice now. Arjuna has already chosen, you have given him the first right. So I have to be satisfied with your Narayani Sena. Okay, all right. I'll be satisfied with that. Okay, thank you both of you. I'm leaving. And he said, he got up and he walked out. Now when Duryodhana walked out, Krishna looked at Arjuna and he said, Arjuna, I said, I will be, I will not take up arms. Then why did you choose me? You should have taken the army. The entire Yadava army was at your disposal. Arjuna immediately said, Oh Krishna, you are the supreme personality of Godhead. Wherever you are there, Lakshmi Devi is also there. That means all opulence is also there. All victory is also there. I am not bothered about winning or losing this battle. I want you. You are the person whom I want. You are the goal of my life. So I don't want anything else. Everything else is secondary. If you are there with me, for me, everything else is achieved.

#### Krishna's reciprocation, Lord's love for devotees, Krishna as charioteer

**Key Quote:** "Although Krishna is the supreme person, he is the master of everyone, still Krishna loves to become subordinate to the commands of his devotee."
**Summary:** Krishna, overwhelmed by Arjuna's love, agrees to become his charioteer, illustrating the loving relationship between the Lord and his devotees.

So Krishna was overwhelmed by this love from Arjuna. And he said, and he told Arjuna, Arjuna, I am, I am indebted to you for the love you have shown me. So please tell me how I can help you in this battle. Then Arjuna told Krishna that Krishna has a great desire. I want you to be my charioteer in this battle. Krishna readily agreed. He said, is that all? Definitely I'll be your charioteer. You can see Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. Krishna's lotus feet are worshipped even by Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma. All the devatas are waiting for an opportunity to have darshan of the lotus feet of Krishna. Krishna is such an exalted personality. He is the supreme personality of Godhead. There is nobody equal to him, nobody above him. Such is the greatness of Krishna. He is bhoktaram yajna tapasam sarva loka mahishuram. All the universes, all the planetary systems are emanating from Krishna. Krishna is the supreme creator. And therefore everything belongs to him. And all the ajnas, all the sacrifices, all the Vedas are meant for pleasing Krishna. And that Krishna is agreeing to become the charioteer of Arjuna, his devotee. These are the loving dealings between the Lord, between Lord Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead, and his devotees. Although Krishna is the supreme person, he is the master of everyone. Still Krishna loves to become subordinate to the commands of his devotee. Just like how Krishna subjugated himself to the love of Yashodhamai and agreed to be bound by her to that martyr. Although he cannot be bound by any material rope, still he was bound by the love of Yashodhamai. Similarly, Krishna was bound by the love of Arjuna and he agreed to take orders from Arjuna by becoming his charioteer.

#### Balarama, Duryodhana's persistence, Krishna's expansions, Anandamayo Abhyasat

**Key Quote:** "Anandamayo Abhyasat by nature, the supreme lord being a person, he desires to enjoy."
**Summary:** Duryodhana, not giving up, approaches Balarama for support, while the speaker explains the concept of Krishna's expansions for the purpose of enjoyment and relationship.

In the meantime, Duryodhana had still not given up. His mind was constantly working. He thought, okay, let's refuse to partake in the battle. But what about Balarama? He is the next most powerful personality. While Arjuna and Krishna were discussing like this, Duryodhana had left Krishna's room and he had gone to approach Balarama. The added advantage for Duryodhana with Balarama was Balarama was his guru as far as learning the art of fighting with the gatha, with the mace was concerned. So Duryodhana already had a good relationship with Balarama. And very quickly he approached Balarama before Arjuna could approach. And Duryodhana approached Balarama and he told him that like this, I have come here seeking your support and I approached Lord Krishna also. But Krishna has agreed to become, he told that he would decide, he would divide the Narayani Sena and himself. One side he will be there without arms and the other side will be his army. And Arjuna chose Krishna. Now I have come to you seeking your support. Now Duryodhana did not know the actual position of Balarama. Actually Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. Now it is stated in the Vedas that Anandamayo Abhyasat by nature, the supreme lord being a person, he desires to enjoy. And when he desires to enjoy, what does he do? Just like in this material world, whenever we want to enjoy, what do we do? We enter into relationships with other individuals. We enjoy in relationship with our families and with our friends and relatives etc. We do not enjoy if we are all alone. If we have got something nice to eat, then we want to call a few friends and we want to share it with them. If we want to watch a movie, we want to go with our family. If we want to go on a vacation, we want to take our wives and children along with us. This is the nature of a person, of an individual person. This nature of human beings is actually a result of being of the individual nature. Being a part and parcel of the supreme lord. Because the supreme lord has a propensity to enjoy in relationship with others, we being emanations, we being part and parcel of that supreme lord, we also have, we also possess similar propensity

#### Balarama's devotion to Krishna, Balarama's refusal, Duryodhana's disappointment

**Key Quote:** "I cannot even dream of opposing Krishna in any manner."
**Summary:** Balarama refuses to support Duryodhana, stating he cannot oppose Krishna and decides to go on pilgrimage, leaving Duryodhana disappointed.

to enjoy with other individuals. Now, Krishna when he desires to enjoy, he expands himself. He is not dependent upon individuals other than himself to enjoy. He expands himself into other personalities. He expands himself into first as Balarama. And that Balarama further expands into the Chaturvyuha expansion of Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha. And from that Sankarsana again expands Narayana. From that Narayana, the second quadruple expansion of Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha come out. And from that second Sankarsana come the Vishnu avataras within this material world. So like this, the lord expands himself into innumerable forms of the Vishnu tattva as well as his incarnation. And the lord also expands himself into his devotees. And then the lord expands himself into all the living entities that we all are. And so like this, the lord expands himself into unlimited forms to engage in wonderful loving relationships with different individuals. Now Balarama is the first expansion of Krishna. And he is imbued with love for Krishna. When the lord descended as Ramachandra, the same Balarama descended as Lakshmana. And in the past times of Lord Ramachandra, Lord Ramachandra had to undergo so much difficulty. And Lakshmana being a younger brother, many times he had great desire to partake, to express his anguish whenever he saw Lord Ramachandra suffering. But he could not express because he was a younger brother and he was inhibited by that subordinate position. So when the Supreme Lord Krishna personally descended in this world, Balarama came as his elder brother so that he could express his anguish whenever Krishna would feel any sort of distress. And also Balarama could play a protective role and prevent anybody from causing any harm or distress to Krishna. So Balarama is very very possessive of Krishna and he will not think of doing anything other than what Krishna likes. The moment when Balarama heard that Krishna has already given himself to the Pandavas, Balarama told Duryodhana, I cannot even dream of opposing Krishna in any manner. And because this is a family quarrel, I will not participate in this. Let Krishna give support to the Pandavas. I am giving up my Kshatriya Dharma. I am retiring from this Kshatriya duties of fighting and engaging in battle and all these kind of things. I am going on Teertha Yatra. Balarama decided to go on pilgrimage. And so Duryodhana thought, okay, anyway Balarama did not come to my side, but he is not going to fight on the side of the Pandavas also. So there is no loss. Then he said, okay, fine, alright. If you don't want to fight, no problem.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra, King Dhritarashtra wants peace."
**Summary:** Sanjaya arrives with Dhritarashtra's message of peace, but Yudhishthira insists on the return of Indraprastha as a condition for peace.

And Duryodhana went back to Hastinapura. And in this manner, Krishna became the charioteer of Arjuna. And now Arjuna took Krishna with him and went back to the kingdom of Virata for further consultation and seeking Krishna's advice on what they should do next. After Krishna and Arjuna had reached the kingdom of Virata, they came to know that Sanjaya has come there, bringing the message of Dhritarashtra. The Pandavas, they all assembled and they called forth Sanjaya. Sanjaya came there. After receiving all the welcoming hospitality, Sanjaya came forward into that assembly and Yudhishthira Maharaj received him very warmly because the Pandavas knew Sanjaya for a long time. And Sanjaya had also been always very favorable towards the Pandavas. Although he was the secretary of Dhritarashtra, he knew that the Pandavas were righteous and he was always favorable to them. This Sanjaya came before the Pandavas and Yudhishthira Maharaj asked about the welfare of all the senior people in the Kaurava household like Bhishma Dev, Dronacharya, Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, etc. And Sanjaya also told Yudhishthira and the Pandavas that they were all doing well and that he has brought a message from Dhritarashtra. Yudhishthira Maharaj said, please go ahead, please let us know what message you are bringing from Dhritarashtra. Then Sanjaya told Yudhishthira that Dhritarashtra, King Dhritarashtra wants peace. He does not want any kind of fighting, infighting. And he has said that he is ready to consider all options to avoid any kind of war or any kind of skirmish, and let us peacefully settle the matter. And he has also said that there is no point in fighting, infighting between the family members. If the family members kill each other, then what are we achieving? We are not achieving anything. It is not good for either party. So let us avoid fighting. This is the message.

**Key Quote:** "Duty of a Kshatriya is to fight or not in the face of injustice."
**Summary:** Sanjaya questions Yudhishthira's inclination towards war, prompting Yudhishthira to defend his position as a Kshatriya upholding Dharma, and seeking Krishna's judgment.

So Yudhishthira replied to Sanjaya, See, if you want peace, the solution is very simple. Return Indraprastha to us. Matter will be settled. I assure you that we will forget all animosity, whatever the Kauravas, they have insulted us, whatever humiliation they have done towards us, how they cheated us in the game of dice, we will forget all that and we will live as friends. I assure you this. On the other hand, if you do not hand over Indraprastha to us, then we are not sitting here idly. Arjuna is having the Gandiva in his hand and Bhima is having his Gada in his hand and you will have to reply to these two people and no force in this world can withstand the force of these two weapons of my brothers. When Sanjaya heard this, he was surprised. He said, Yudhishthira, how is it that you are so much inclined to war? You should be thinking of how to get peace. A righteous person is never inclined towards war and to quarrel and such things. He should always think of how to maintain peace and harmony in the society because wars always bring untold suffering to humanity. Everyone knows this. So how is it that you are behaving like this adharmically? When Sanjaya said this, Yudhishthira said that you please first consider what is the duty of a Kshatriya. Duty of a Kshatriya is to fight or not in the face of injustice. In the face of injustice, is a Kshatriya supposed to keep quiet? And what is happening with us here? Is it just or is it unjust? So on whose side is Dharma? You please consider this. And then Yudhishthira Maharaj turned to Krishna and he said, Lord Krishna, you decide whether what I am saying is right or wrong. You please tell us whether I am wrong in expressing that in case the kingdom is not given, there has to be war. Am I a war mongering person? Am I going against the principles of Dharma? Then Sanjaya also looked towards Krishna because Sanjaya also knew that Krishna is the Supreme Lord. Krishna responded that Yudhishthira, whatever you have said is perfectly according to the codes of Dharma. You have always lived righteously and your demand for the return of your kingdom is also righteous. And Sanjaya suddenly, everybody could see Krishna's face becoming very grave and they could sense Krishna's rising anger.

#### Krishna's anger, Injustice, Draupadi's disrobing, Dharma and Adharma

**Key Quote:** "Now what right do you have to speak of Dharma?"
**Summary:** Krishna expresses his anger, reminding Sanjaya of the injustices suffered by the Pandavas, particularly the disrobing of Draupadi, and condemning the Kauravas' actions.

Krishna said, Sanjaya, how did the Kauravas get hold of Indraprastha? Do you remember? They cheated Yudhishthira Maharaj in that game of dice. Although Yudhishthira Maharaj was saying in that assembly that he did not wish to play that game of dice, still he was goaded into playing that game of dice. Although he was not so keen on playing that game of dice, unfairly Duryodhana made Shakuni his partner and he cheated Yudhishthira of his kingdom, of his brothers and his wife. And when Yudhishthira had lost his kingdom, at that point of time, what were you all doing? You were all sitting in the assembly keeping quiet? You did not stop? What was going on? The game of cheating dice? And then what happened? Draupadi was pulled into that assembly and she was attempted to be disrobed. When her honour was being violated, which person in that assembly stood up and spoke? Except for Vikarna. Did Bhishma oppose it? Did Drona oppose it? You were also there. Did you oppose it? So at that time, you did not think of Dharma. Now what right do you have to speak of Dharma? You have no right to talk about what is right and what is wrong. You have no right to talk about Dharma and Adharma. Forget it. You keep it aside. Whatever the kingdom has been taken by force by the Kauravas has to be returned. Otherwise there will be war and Duryodhana and all his brothers will bite the dust. So Krishna's anger was something which was unexpected. And everybody was taken aback, including Sanjaya. But Sanjaya also felt ashamed because whatever Krishna had said was true. In that assembly, Dushyasana was trying to disrobe Draupadi. When Karna was inciting Duryodhana to drag Draupadi into that assembly, none of them had opposed. Sanjaya had not opposed. Sanjaya had kept quiet. This was wrong on his part. Sanjaya accepted that. So he bowed his head and kept quiet. So finally, after little more discussion like this, Sanjaya asked the Pandavas, Please give me your message.

**Key Quote:** "Our message is very simple. Please hand over Indraprastha, which is rightfully ours, back to us."
**Summary:** The Pandavas reiterate their message, demanding the return of Indraprastha or at least five villages, with Bhima surprisingly advocating for peace.

What is the message I have to give to Dhritarashtra? Yudhishthir Maharaj told him, Our message is very simple. Please hand over Indraprastha, which is rightfully ours, back to us. We will forget all hostility and we will live as friends and brothers. On the other hand, if you wish to, if you do not give the kingdom back to us, then there has to be war. And even if you give five villages, one for each of five brothers, we are ready to even accept that because we are Kshatriyas. Our duty is to rule. As long as we have got a place to rule and some citizens to administer, then we have no issues. We are ready even for that. This is our message. And then Krishna spoke to Arjuna. Krishna asked Arjuna, Arjuna, what is your response? And Arjuna responded, He said, Whatever my brother Yudhishthir Maharaj has said is fully right and I stand fully with him. If the Kauravas are ready to give back Indraprastha, we will maintain peace. Otherwise, my Gandiva will speak. We will not speak anymore. Then Krishna looked at Bhima and he said, Bhima, what do you have to say? Now what was Bhima's response? Normally, we would expect Bhima to be the most angry of the lot and the person who was most thirsting for revenge. Surprisingly, Bhima spoke very peacefully and Bhima said, My dear Sanjaya, we want peace. We don't want any fight. Please tell Dhritarashtra that somehow please convince Duryodhana to give us at least five villages. We are happy with that. We don't want any fight. We don't want any battle. Why we should fight and kill each other unnecessarily? If we on one side and you Kauravas with Bhishma, Drona and all on the other side fight, what is the result which is going to happen? We will simply kill each other. I don't want to see such bloodshed. Let us avoid all this. Let us maintain peace.

**Summary:** Bhima clarifies his desire for peace stems from compassion, but reaffirms his vow for revenge, prompting Krishna's laughter, and the lecture concludes with a promise of the next episode.

Krishna was surprised and Krishna started laughing. Krishna said, What is it that I am hearing Bhima? Looks like you have become afraid when the time for battle has come. What happened to all those words of revenge and all those things you were speaking? Then Bhima became very grave and he said, Krishna, it is not that I have become afraid. I was feeling compassionate towards the Kauravas because if there is battle, definitely they will be killed. And I thought, why they have to go through all this pain and Dhritarashtra and Gandhari will have to suffer seeing their sons killed before them. So I was being compassionate and thought, let us avoid it. But otherwise I am not afraid. I am waiting for battle. Let the Kaurava brothers come. I am waiting to fulfill my vow. I have vowed to kill Dushyasana and rip his heart out and drink his blood. I am waiting for the battle to happen between both of us. So Krishna smiled and said, and he said, This is the Bhima we know. Fine. So like this, everybody's message was given and Sanjaya started back to Hastinapura. And when he reached Hastinapura and how was the message from the Pandavas received? What was the reaction in the Kaurava? What was the reaction in the Kaurava palace? Please join us in the next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna. Jagat Guru Shri La Pravupada Ki Jai Netai Gor Prem Anandae

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, focusing on Arjuna and Duryodhana seeking Krishna's support and Sanjaya's unsuccessful peace mission.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to this episode of the Mahabharata. In the previous episode, we have seen how Duryodhana and Arjuna approached Krishna for his support. Arjuna chose to have Krishna who would be beside the Pandavas. Arjuna was helping them, assisting them in the battle but unarmed, and Duryodhana got the Yadava army, and Balarama decided to go on pilgrimage, not wishing to take part with either of the family members. And then we also saw how Sanjaya brought Dhritarashtra's message to the Pandavas with actually no concrete proposal, just asking for peace and nothing more. He was not offering the kingdom back to the Pandavas, and the Pandavas gave their response and sent Sanjaya back.

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana smiled slyly this was a cunning arrangement from him to make Shalya indebted so that he could seek his support"
**Summary:** The story of King Shalya being tricked by Duryodhana's hospitality into fighting for the Kauravas is narrated, highlighting the importance of keeping one's word of honor.

Now, how was Sanjaya received in the Kaurava palace? That is what we will see today. Before that, when the message was reaching all the kings all over the world about the impending battle between Pandavas and Kauravas, in the kingdom of Madhra, Madhra Desha, there was the king who was known as Shalya. He was the son of Somadatta and his brother was Burishtaba. His sister was Madhri, and Madhri, as we know, was married to Pandu. When the message of this impending fight between the Pandavas and Kauravas reached Madhra Desha, Shalya wanted to support the Pandavas naturally because they were his sister's sons, and so he took his army and set out to the kingdom of Virata. Now, when Shalya was taking his army and proceeding towards the kingdom of Virata, he found that all along the way there had been many nice encampments created for him and his soldiers to rest during the nights. They would travel during the day, and during the night they would set camp somewhere along the way, and wherever they were supposed to put camp, already tents were arranged, various arrangements were made for their food and for their secure resting during the night, and good drinking water was made available, clean water for their clothing, for their bathing, and for washing their clothes. All these arrangements were made. Shalya was very happy when he saw this. He was pleasantly surprised. So as they approached the kingdom of Virata, at every stage he found wonderful arrangements were made. Shalya was very happy. He was thinking that the Pandavas, knowing that I am coming to them for supporting them, have made such wonderful arrangements. Yudhishthira is really very grateful and kind. And when they were close to the kingdom of Virata, Shalya, being so happy with all the arrangements because it took him so many days to come from Madhurdesha till here, he could not contain himself, and he was saying, "Where is Yudhishthira? I really want to meet him. I cannot wait till I reach the kingdom of Virata to meet him. He has made such wonderful arrangements. I am really obliged to him." Please, he spoke to the servants who had been deployed there for taking care of the hospitality of King Shalya and all his retinue. He told them, "Please go and call Yudhishthira. I want to meet them." These servants started looking at each other and with a puzzled look they stepped out of the camp and they started talking to each other. "Shalya is talking of Yudhishthira, what is this? All these arrangements have been made by Duryodhana." So anyway, let us go and convey to Duryodhana. They went and conveyed like this to Duryodhana, "Like this, Shalya is really obliged, but he is thinking Yudhishthira has made all these arrangements and he wants to meet you to thank you and expresses indebtedness." Duryodhana smiled slyly. This was a cunning arrangement from him to make Shalya indebted so that he could seek his support. So in a cunning way, he wanted to divert Shalya to his camp, and now Duryodhana, now that he knew Shalya had taken all his hospitality and he was now indebted to him, Duryodhana came before him, and Shalya, when he saw Duryodhana, he was taken aback, and he said, "Duryodhana, what are you doing here?" Duryodhana said, "I am the one who have made all the arrangements for you and I have taken care of all your hospitality en route so that you don't have any difficulty in your travel." See how cunning Duryodhana is. Now Shalya felt trapped. To his nephews, but he landed up with Duryodhana, and he said, "Okay, Duryodhana, I have taken all your hospitality, so I am indebted to you. Now you please tell me whatever you want. I am ready to give. I cannot go back on my... this is my word of honor because it is... it is for a respectable man, if he has taken somebody's hospitality, he has to fulfill his obligation towards the host." Duryodhana then said, "I want you and your army to fight with me whenever we have to fight with the Pandavas." Now Shalya was in a fix. He said, "Duryodhana, what to do? I understand what you have done now, but now it's too late. I have also, without thinking, without asking, I enjoyed all the hospitality you have given me, so I'm obliged to... I'll keep my word of honor. I am a man of my word of honor, so I will, since you have asked me, I cannot refuse. I will fight on your side."

**Summary:** Yudhishthira's magnanimous nature is discussed, emphasizing his commitment to Dharma over personal gain, which made him dear to great personalities.

Duryodhana was extremely happy his ploy had worked. He had cheated Shalya into joining him because Shalya was a powerful king, and he had, in effect, what had happened? Shalya had come with a certain army, now that much army was lesser in the Pandavas, that much was more in the Kauravas army. So then Duryodhana said, "Very fantastic, now I request you please come with me to Hastinapura." Shalya replied, "I will come to Hastinapura anyway. I was going to the kingdom of Virata. I want to meet my nephews. I will meet them. Then I will come to Hastinapura." And so then Duryodhana went back to Hastinapura. King Shalya proceeded to the kingdom of Virata. There he met Yudhishthira Maharaj and he explained to him what all had happened. And Yudhishthira Maharaj, when he heard everything, he told King Shalya, "My dear uncle, I feel that whatever you have done is the right thing. You should keep your word of honor. Although your support for us was invaluable, still your word of honor, the promise you have made is far more important. So you have done the right thing. Without any feeling of ill will, you may please proceed and be with Duryodhana." You can see how small-minded Duryodhana was and how magnanimous Yudhishthira was. Yudhishthira was a great man. Yudhishthira was more keen that the path of Dharma should be followed rather than his personal conveniences or his personal victory or gaining of the kingdom from the battle. That was less important for Yudhishthira Maharaj, and that is why Yudhishthira is so highly glorified and he was

so dear to all the great personalities like Bhishma, Drona, etc., and even Lord Krishna himself. Actually, if we want to know the truth about Yudhishthira Maharaj, we need to know the truth about Yudhishthira Maharaj. If we want to attain the favor of the Supreme Lord Krishna, and if we want everlasting fame, and we want that people should honor and respect one, then it is possible only if we follow the path of Dharma scrupulously. If we follow a pious life, then automatically people will respect us and the Supreme Lord will also, he will become dear to us. On the other hand, if we take, if we accept a life which is based on sin, then like Duryodhana we may enjoy temporary opulence and power and all that, but we will never be dear to anyone, not to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is something which we have to very clearly understand from the examples of Duryodhana and Yudhishthira Maharaj. We should not get swayed by instant success. We should look at what is the long-term repercussions of our actions and consequences of our actions.

**Key Quote:** "In such an event, you should do your best to demoralize Karna by uttering words which are unfavorable and which are discouraging to him."
**Summary:** Yudhishthira requests Shalya to demoralize Karna during the battle, and Shalya agrees, demonstrating Yudhishthira's strategic thinking and concern for Arjuna's safety.

That is far more important than some petty immediate gains. Now, Dvideshwara Maharaj told the King Shalya, "But there is still something that you can do for us." And King Shalya immediately became very eager and he said, "Please tell me, how can I help you in this battle? Well, if there is at all anything I can do, I am ready to do." Then Dvideshwara Maharaj told him, "See, King Shalya, you are renowned for your skills in driving chariots. There is nobody who is equal to you in driving a chariot. So, during the battle of Kurukshetra, eventually it will come to a pass that when Arjuna and Karna have to face each other in battle, you will be asked to drive the chariot. In such an event, you should do your best to demoralize Karna by uttering words which are unfavorable and which are discouraging to him. That will help Arjuna to win over Karna." Of course, Arjuna did not need this help. Arjuna was supported by Lord Krishna, but still Yudhishthira, out of great love for his younger brother, out of fear for his safety, Yudhishthira made this request. And King Shalya immediately assented and he said, "Oh, this is something which I can definitely do. I will keep this in mind and when the opportunity arises, I will definitely do my best." And having promised Yudhishthira Maharaj like this, King Shalya left and he proceeded towards Hastinapura with his army to join the bigger army, which Duryodhana had assembled.

**Summary:** Sanjaya returns to Hastinapura and conveys Yudhishthira's message of peace, urging Dhritarashtra to reject Duryodhana and return the kingdom to the Pandavas, but his advice is ignored.

Now, when Sanjaya came back to Hastinapura, it was already evening, and he directly went and met Dhritarashtra. And Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya what had transpired. Sanjaya informed Dhritarashtra that Yudhishthira Maharaj is so righteous. He is even now saying a very simple thing. He is ready to accept the kingdom back and forget all the animosity and hostility shown by Duryodhana. So, my dear King, you have always acted sinfully by supporting Duryodhana. Please, at least now, act in the right way. Reject Duryodhana. Hand over the kingdom back to the Pandavas and earn their goodwill. This is the only way we can live in peace. And then Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, "Okay, now tell me about the menace. What they have sent." And then Sanjaya told him, "I am tired now. I will go and take rest, and in the morning I will come to the assembly, and in the assembly, in front of everyone, I will share the message." Next day morning, Sanjaya came into the assembly and he spoke all those words which Yudhishthira Maharaj had spoken as well as what Krishna had spoken and what Arjuna and Bhima had also spoken. When the Kaurava house, when the Kaurava council heard all this, Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, all these people started telling Dhritarashtra that, "You see, now the only way is that you hand over the kingdom to the Pandavas and the Pandavas, along with all the other Kaurava brothers, let them all live peacefully together as brothers. And imagine, if Duryodhana and his hundred brothers and the Pandavas are together, then who can question your sovereignty? Your ruling over the world will be unquestioned. Even the Devatas will not be able to stand against you in battle." So in this way, Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, all of them tried explaining to

explaining to Dhritarashtra. But Dhritarashtra could also see that he was a reasonable person. He could understand what they were saying. But ultimately Dhritarashtra was bound by Duryodhana. When he looked at Duryodhana and when Dhritarashtra spoke to Duryodhana and he said, "My dear son, we should take the path of peace. Let us, you please tell, we should return the kingdom to the Pandavas." Duryodhana was unwilling. Supported by Karna, Shakuni, they were all saying, "No, no, no, no, why we should give back? Forget living with the Pandavas in friendship and all that. This is all will not work. They have actually violated the agreement and this and that," and all those kind of things. So Bhishma finally said, he said, "Duryodhana, your intelligence has been stolen. You are... you listen to only three people. One is Karna, who is a charioteer and who has been cursed by even his guru. He could not even please his guru. And another is the cunning Shakuni, who is always interested in cheating. He does not follow Dharma. And the third is your small-minded brother, Dushyasana. These are the only three people you will listen to. At least listen to what we are telling you. Look at what Dronacharya is saying, Vidura is saying, I am saying, listen to your father. Why don't you follow the right path?" When Karna heard this, he got very angry. He said, "Oh, Bhishma Deva, every time, whenever you get an opportunity, you are going on blaming me. What have I done? I have stood by Duryodhana because Duryodhana is right. What wrong has he done? He is following the path of Dharma. How can you say he is not following the path of Dharma?" Like this, Duryodhana started talking. Like this, the argument went back and forth between the different personalities. Then finally, Duryodhana said that no matter what happens, I will not return the kingdom of Indraprastha to the Pandavas. I cannot live with them in friendship. We have to have a battle and we have to decide. Either they have to live or I have to live. I cannot live in peace with them. That is out of question. So like this,

**Key Quote:** "I alone am enough for the Pandavas. All five Pandavas, I will finish. Just leave them to me."
**Summary:** Karna boasts about defeating the Pandavas, leading to a heated exchange with Bhishma, who criticizes Karna's past failures and ultimately causes Karna to vow not to fight while Bhishma is on the battlefield.

Duryodhana spoke and Karna immediately supported Duryodhana. "Don't worry, Duryodhana. I am there. No, you let all the... let Bhishma, Drona and all the other Kauravas take care of other kings. I alone am enough for the Pandavas. All five Pandavas, I will finish. Just leave them to me. That's all. Don't worry. I am there with you." Bhishma looked at Karna. He said, "What are you talking? All simply boasting your talk. When the Gandharvas took away Duryodhana, what did you do? You ran away. And then, Arjuna had to come and save him. And in the kingdom of Virata, you were there, we were there, we were all there and you were also there. We all saw your prowess, how you fought with Arjuna and defeated him. Actually, what happened? You ran away from Arjuna. And after doing all these, you are not even one-sixteenth of Arjuna's power, and you are saying, you will conquer all the five Pandavas. You are simply boasting all the time. Please stop this. After all, what have you done in your life? You are not even pleased, dear Guru Parashurama. You only managed to try to cheat him and he cursed you also. Why are you simply instigating Duryodhana like this?" Now, Karna got very much riled up and he became very offended. Then he stood up and he said, "Oh, like this, Bhishma is talking like this, always he is blaming me. I cannot tolerate this. If Bhishma is there in the battle, as long as he is in the battlefield, I will not take up weapons. If the day Bhishma Dev steps out of the battle, I will come and I will show my prowess." Like that, he stood up and in a huff, he walked out of the assembly.

**Summary:** Duryodhana diplomatically calms Bhishma and Drona, while Dhritarashtra, aware of the impending doom, remains a puppet in Duryodhana's hands, unable to prevent the war.

Now, Duryodhana was scratching his head. He said, "Oh my God, I was depending on Karna to fight the battle. Now Karna is left and gone. Now, what will I do?" Then he was seeing here and there. Then he said, "Okay, okay, Bhishma Dev, please cool down, calm down. Anyway, let us plan how to deal with the situation. I do not want to give back the kingdom to the Pandavas. We have to prepare for battle, and for that, I am depending upon you. You have to protect the kingdom of Srinapura." And like this, Duryodhana very diplomatically, he calmed down Dronacharya and Bhishma Dev and all, and he also left the assembly. Now, so finally, it was very clear that Duryodhana would at no cost return the kingdom to the Pandavas, and Dhritarashtra, although he was advised repeatedly by Vidura, Dronacharya, Bhishma Dev, etc., Dhritarashtra could never go against what Duryodhana would say. He was a puppet in the hands of Duryodhana. Although Dhritarashtra knew the reality, he knew that the Pandavas were far too powerful. They were... nobody could defeat them. Karna was insignificant in front of them. Although Bhishma Dev and Dronacharya were powerful, still Arjuna had already shown in the kingdom of Virata how he was far more powerful, and he was an equal match to Bhishma Dev, an equal match to Bhishma and Dronacharya. So, Dhritarashtra knew all this and he was very much grounded to reality. He knew that if there was a battle, the only outcome would be that Duryodhana and all his sons would be killed. But what to do? He was a puppet in the hands of Duryodhana. He could not go against his wishes. So, it looked like his destiny was sealed.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Ramachandra's rule made the entire earth equal to Brahmaloka."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the qualities of Lord Ramachandra's rule, comparing it to the spiritual world (Vaikuntha) where there is no misery, and highlighting the abundance and lack of suffering during his reign.

Regarding the rule of Lord Ramachandra, the Skanda Purana states, "As long as Lord Ramachandra ruled over..." Ruled over what? "Samastam Kshiti Vandalam." Kshiti means the earth. Kshiti Vandala means the earth globe. The entire earth was ruled over by Lord Ramachandra during his time. As long as Lord Ramachandra ruled over the earth, "Samastam Kshiti Vandalam Brahmaloka Samam Chakra." Lord Ramachandra's rule made the entire earth equal to Brahmaloka. Brahmaloka here refers to the spiritual world, which is where Brahman sustains the spiritual world. So it is called Brahmaloka, which is also known as Vaikuntha. The spiritual world is called Vaikuntha, meaning it is Vigatakuntha, meaning it is the place where there is no misery at all. Hence, during the reign of Lord Ramachandra, the entire earth was ruled over by Lord Ramachandra. He was rid of all kinds of miseries; there were no natural calamities. The weather was always pleasant, with the summers and winters appearing like springtime without excessive heat or excessive cold. The earth always produced grains, fruits, and vegetables abundantly. No one ever went hungry. The pangs of old age and disease were unknown to the citizens. No son died in the presence of his father, meaning everyone lived long lives, and no one died young. Not only that, there was no death for anyone who did not want it. So these are all the descriptions of how Lord Ramachandra...

The whole world was inundated with the chanting of the holy name of Lord Rama, being drowned in the flood of chanting the holy name of Lord Ramachandra. Everyone was floating in the ocean of love of Godhead, and so no miseries could touch them. This is because in Vaikuntha, everyone is similarly drowned in loving chanting of the holy name of Lord Ramachandra, and so no miseries could touch them. This is because chanting and serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a similar situation emerged on the earth during the rule of Lord Ramachandra. It was exactly like the spiritual world; the entire earth became as good as Vaikuntha, being filled with the reverberation of the holy name of Lord Ramachandra. And like this, Lord Ramachandra converted the whole earth to Vaikuntha. Lord Ramachandra ruled the earth for 13,000 years and created a Vaikuntha atmosphere on the entire earth, with every millimeter of the globe being pervaded with the chanting of the holy names of Lord Ramachandra, and the only work being done by Lord Ramachandra was the worship of Lord Ramachandra.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Rama Rajya with Ravana's Lanka, emphasizing that economic and military power alone cannot bring happiness and that devotion to Lord Rama is essential.

and the devotional service to Lord Ramachandra for everyone who was there at that point of time. Even now, if we want the same Rama Rajya, we can create it. What is the secret for creating Rama Rajya? The secret is not economic development; it is not military or political power. Ravana, in fact, had all these. His Lanka was called Svarna Lanka. Why? Because every house in Lanka was clad with gold. The richest of the people in the world today clad their houses with Italian marble or granite or some expensive stuff like that. But during Ravana's rule, every house was clad with actual gold. Can you imagine that? That was... we can imagine the economic powerhouse Lanka had become under Ravana. And moreover, the military power of Ravana was unrivaled in this whole universe. But despite all this economic and military and personal power, what happened? Ravana was quickly destroyed along with his life breath. Why? Because Dara means wife. Because he stole the wife of Lord Rama. Because Ravana abducted Sita Devi, his lifespan was cut short. And how was it cut short? Vispurjita Dhanusha. Simply by the twanging of the bow of Lord Rama, Ravana instantly lost his life. Lord Ramachandra did not have to take any big endeavor, simply by the twanging of his bow. So we can see from this that although Ravana had immense economic and military power, his citizens are not described to be free from anxiety and filled with bliss like the citizens of Lanka. And so, Ravana was cut short. And how was it cut short? Vispurjita Dhanusha.

That means economic, scientific, medical, political, and military power are not the real cause of happiness amongst the people. Then, what can bring Ramarajya back?

**Key Quote:** "If we fill our lives and the world with chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, then the world can again experience Ramaraja, a world full of immense happiness and love of Godhead, Krishna Prema."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the power of chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra to create Rama Rajya, even in Kali Yuga, leading to liberation and a life free from the problems of birth, death, disease, and old age.

The secret is... We do not control the world. All human... Uh, been constante due to Anda's devoid of all distresses, then it is inundated with "Ramo Ramo Rama Iti." If we fill our lives and the world with chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. If we fill our lives and the world with this Hare Krishna Mahamantra, then the world can again experience Ramaraja, a world full of immense happiness and love of Godhead, Krishna Prema. So the Srimad Bhagavatam says that even though Kali Yuga is filled with so many faults, so many flaws, so many problems, full of distresses, still there is one... one great, good quality, auspicious quality in Kali Yuga. What is that? "Keertanadeva Krishnasya." Simply by performing this Keertana or singing and chanting of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, what will happen? "Keertanadeva Krishnasya Muktasangaha." One will become free from all attachments in this material world and "Parambarajet," we will be able to go back to the spiritual world which is Vaikuntha, free from all distresses, free from the problems of birth, death, disease, and old age which pervades this entire material world. Nobody is free from these four problems. If we want real freedom from these four problems, then we have to take shelter of the holy name of Krishna and Rama, we have to chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra, we have to remember Lord Ramachandra's pastimes, Lord Krishna's pastimes, and then our lives can become completely blissful and the effects of birth, death, disease, and old age will become diminished in our life.

that the movement should not flounder in his absence. On April 10, 1977, Srila Prabhupada said, "Don't spoil it. We are very good, prestigious people. Don't spoil it. It's a hard day. It started with a very emotional moment. I am in humble condition, I am just comfortable, such exalted position. Don't spoil it. That is my request. Increase. That will depend on your character, behavior, position." Srila Prabhupada repeated the same request on April 22, 1977, saying, "Keep to our principle and see our GVP. It's very a lot. Then everything is gone. I am not there. Do that. That is my request. Whatever I left to you, I have taught you. Follow that. Nobody will be able to do it. No māyā will tell you. Now Kṛṣṇa is giving us, and there is no scarcity of money. To cut both, I'm sorry. Everything is there. You have got good sages all over the world. You have got, in the street you have got… Even if I die suddenly, you'll be able to manage. That I want. Manage nicely, don't go back." That was Prabhupada's concern. Again, Srila Prabhupada reiterated the same concern on 29th April 1977, where he said, "The only request is, don't spoil it."

**Summary:** Explanation of the three primary things Srila Prabhupada established: deity worship, disciplic succession, and pure books.

Srila Prabhupada wanted that whatever he had set up should continue without changes, and then the movement would flourish unhindered. Out of the many things that Srila Prabhupada set up in ISKCON, three things were primary. One was the system of deity worship. Everything that was offered to the deities, whether the arathis or the bhoga, would have to be first offered to the guru, Srila Prabhupada, and then to Nithyananda Prabhu. After that, then the arathi or the bhoga would be offered to Goranga Maha Prabhu, then it would be offered to Radharani, and finally it would get offered to Krishna. This was the system of deity worship Srila Prabhupada set up. The second thing was the disciplic conclusion, which was all the deities were offered to the guru and then there in Prabhupada's books in their pure and unadulterated form.

**Summary:** Discussion of the Diksha system, the Rtvik system, and the GBC's subsequent changes to deity worship, books, and initiations.

And the third thing, the third thing was the system of deeksha or initiations. Srila Prabhupada set up and ran the dithích system of initiations in ISKCON from 1970 to 1977, and on July 9th, 1977, Srila Prabhupada ordered the dithích system to continue even in his absence. All that was twelve years and the existence of riti groups or in口ic scoring groups and their duasas all that was first mentioned and his mothers brothers and sisters linked gifts all that was all that was reduced to satan as per tradition means he was requesting a nonpublical organization then on 3rd he went to India in 1971 under carbohydrates heComputed a memorialitta needed was that nothing be changed in ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's departure, especially these three things, dictatorship, books and initiations. However, despite Srila Prabhupada's multiple expressions of concern in 1977, that things should not be spoiled and things should continue the way he had set them up. What did the GBC do? The GBC started changing everything. They changed the system of Deity worship to offering everything to Krishna directly first, whether it was Bhoga or it was Arati. This was a complete tectonic shift in the method of Deity worship Prabhupada taught. Not only that, they changed the books and they changed the system of initiations. They changed all the rules of the GBC. They changed the rules of the GBC.

Srila Prabhupada wrote, "Don't change from this to that. That is your American disease. This is very serious that you always want to change everything." Despite Srila Prabhupada's warnings and concerns, he did not change anything. He did not change anything. He did not change anything.

primary things set up by Srila Prabhupada. As far as initiations go, on March 19, 1978, in Resolution No. 16, the GBC resolved, "The GBC will consider each year at Gaurapurnima, the appointment of new spiritual masters to be approved by a three-fourth vote. However, for 1978, no new spiritual masters shall be appointed other than the eleven selected by Srila Prabhupada." So, the GBC declared in 1978 that Srila Prabhupada appointed eleven Diksha Gurus. However, later in 1999, the GBC resolved in Resolution No. 403 that, "Unfortunately, shortly after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance, the GBC body allowed for an unauthorized zonal acharya system to evolve in ISKCON, elevating eleven exclusive successor Diksha Gurus." So, in 1999, 21 years after their resolution declaring that Srila Prabhupada selected eleven Diksha Gurus, the GBC did a old fast and accepted that it was they, not Srila Prabhupada, who would be appointed as the first Diksha Gurus. So, the GBC did a old fast and accepted that it was they, not Srila Prabhupada, who would be the first Diksha Gurus.

**Summary:** The GBC's system of regulating Diksha Gurus was invented without scriptural basis, as admitted by Satswaroop Prabhu.

follows that all other Diksha Gurus as well as the system of regulating Diksha Gurus in ISKCON by the GBC indicating no objection are all invented by the GBC. Till date, the GBC has not given any explanation for the source of their system of regulating Diksha Gurus in ISKCON. In fact, Satswaroop Prabhu, one of the original 11 Diksha Gurus from 1978, said in the year 1986, in an article which appeared in the September-October edition of Hinduism Today, in the article titled, "Murder quickens wider crisis in Krishna sect." In this article, Satswaroop Prabhu said, "If the different worship systems we instituted were accepted, then the system of regulating Diksha Gurus in ISKCON would not have been excessive. My answer is that we did not know what to do because there was no precedent scriptural rule which told us what to do." Satswaroop Prabhu openly accepted that they, the GBC, did not know what they were doing in instituting the Diksha Guru system in ISKCON in 1978. Shaila Prabhupad did not order them to institute a Diksha Guru system in ISKCON nor did he give any instructions on what to do in such a system. Nor did the GBC model their Diksha Guru system on any precedent or tradition or scripture or shastra. It appears that they did what appeared right as per their collective intelligence and discrimination. Their intelligence and discrimination decreased when the JVC was instilled into the Diksha

discrimination dictated that the Ritvik system that Srila Prabhupada ordered for implementation in ISKCON on July 9, 1977, had to be discarded after Srila Prabhupada disappeared. They did not consult Srila Prabhupada, nor did they consult Shastra, nor did they look for precedence or tradition to formulate their Deeksha Guru system, which later on underwent changes to morph into the current day no-objection Guru system. We can safely assume that they did not consult the Supersoul or Paramatma too, either in 1978 or for their current no-objection Guru system. We can also safely assume that they did not consult Shastra, nor did they look for precedence

**Summary:** The GBC does not consult the Supersoul when allowing devotees to act as Diksha Gurus, and they do not endorse them as pure devotees.

that the GBC does not consult the Supersoul or Paramatma whenever they vote for allowing a devotee to act as a Diksha Guru in ISKCON. Especially because in their resolution no. 409 of 2004, the GBC categorically resolved saying, "When the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating, it does not thereby endorse him as an Uttama Adhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. Rather, the GBC indicates that it has no objection to his initiating disciples within ISKCON." This is the GBC's resolution. Unless one is a pure devotee, one cannot talk to Krishna directly. So, as per the GBC's own resolution, they have declared that none of the devotees in ISKCON, not even the Gurus in ISKCON are pure devotees or that they have not even achieved any specific state of realization too. Hence, naturally, we must assume that they are not consulting Krishna in allowing devotees to act as Diksha Guru in ISKCON. They must be doing it on the basis of their intelligence

Listen to this carefully as Srila Prabhupada explains how he appointed temple presidents, how he appointed devotees to BBT positions, etc. "How do you choose? You are responsible for the organization." "Yes." "Are you the one who chooses, who runs each center, who is responsible in each temple?" "Yes. Our program is to open centers in every village, every town to Prabhupada and Krishnapada." "And you choose the leaders?" "Yes." "What Krishna does, he tells you, how does that work?" "No. I have been chosen by my spiritual master." "And you in turn choose others?" "Yes. That is our succession." "On what basis?" "Basis on the order of Krishna. Originally, the order is from Krishna." "How does that come?" "It comes by disciplic succession. Just like Krishna, Krishna said this knowledge to Arjuna, and Arjuna said to others, and it is open. Everyone can take it. There is no secrecy. We have to accept order. That's all."

"I missed that. I am sorry. The order is already there. It is open, open secret. There is no secrecy. Anyone can take it. All right. But in terms of specific, say, choosing specific things, specific details." "Yes. In all details. How to become Krishna Karsayas, there is all details in this book. Bhagavad Gita as it is." So he is asking what is a man's qualification to be chosen? In other words, Prabhupada will decide who should be leader if he is qualified. And there is a process for making him qualified. And there is a process for testing to see if he is qualified. So in that way, it all comes from Krishna. "You chose, for example, these fellows here to run the publishing house and be responsible for..." "Yes. Like he is in charge of publication. He is in charge of doing his research." "On what basis, sir? Can you tell me some of the things?" "Basis, just to see whether he is qualified. That's all. Just like ordinarily, when manager is appointed, by the superior authority, on the merit, on his qualification, that's all." "Okay. It's not... It's a mediated choice, or is it a direct communication from Krishna? That's my question." "No." Oh, he is asking whether we claim that God speaks to us directly. "Yes. God speaks to you when you are qualified. You cannot expect God as order supplier. Yes. When He speaks to you, you are qualified. You cannot expect God as order supplier."

But in the same way that Kṛṣṇa says he will provide for all your needs, you still must work to achieve whatever Kṛṣṇa is giving you. You work for Kṛṣṇa. You have to work to get your necessities. In the same way, I am curious with respect to the way Kṛṣṇa communicates with you, whether it's in a similar kind of way that gives you your necessities. In other words, when you decide that someone is to be in charge of a particular temple, does Kṛṣṇa tell you that this person should be in charge? You, by judging him, say this person is qualified." "Yes. Because a devotee always concerns Kṛṣṇa, and he gives order. So that's a more direct communication." "Yes. And he gives order. Because intelligence… Our philosophy is that intelligence comes from Kṛṣṇa. So if I have something… Your philosophy is that your daily necessities come from Kṛṣṇa." "Yes. I understand. Suppose my intelligence sees that this person is qualified, that means Kṛṣṇa has told me." "No, not necessarily. Kṛṣṇa will tell directly. A devotee always concerns Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa tells him. Two levels. Not figuratively. Practically. Does that apply then to other kinds of decisions and other kinds of activities as well?" "Everything. Everything.

Now, in this exchange, Śrīla Prabhupāda, on being questioned by Mr. Kevin Lehart, about how he appointed temple presidents and devotees to BBT positions, Rāmēśvara Prabhu interpreted Śrīla Prabhupāda's answer by saying, "Suppose my intelligence sees that this person is qualified, that means Kṛṣṇa has told me." This was Rāmēśvara Prabhu's interpretation. In effect, Rāmēśvara Prabhu said that the decision was made by using one's intelligence and that meant that Kṛṣṇa had ordered it. In other words, he said that there is no direct consultation with Kṛṣṇa. But Śrīla Prabhupāda immediately corrected him saying, "No, not necessarily." He said that Kṛṣṇa will tell directly. A devotee always consults Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa tells him, do like this, not figuratively, practically. That means even to appoint temple president or any devotee to a BBT post, Śrīla Prabhupāda would always consult Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa was telling directly to Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrīla Prabhupāda would always consult Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa was telling directly to Śrīla Prabhupāda, do like this, practically, not figuratively.

**Summary:** The spiritual master's order is the order of Krishna, and Srila Prabhupada would consult Krishna directly for all appointments, including Diksha Gurus.

would appoint such a person as a temple president or to any official post in the BBT. Remember the verse Śrīla Prabhupāda so often quoted? Āchāryam mām vijāniyām nāvamanyetakarhi chit. Āchāryam mām vijāniyām nāvamanyetakarhi chit. Āchāryam mām vijāniyām nāvamanyetakarhi chit. These are Krishna's words. Whatever is said by the spiritual master is to be taken as directly the order of Krishna. No one must disrespect or disobey the spiritual master's order because the spiritual master's order is the order of Krishna. Now imagine, if even for BBT posts and temple president posts, Śrīla Prabhupāda was consulting Krishna directly and Krishna was ordering whom to appoint, then is it not all the more applicable to appointing Diksha Gurus in ISKCON, particularly for the time after Śrīla Prabhupāda's departure? Diksha Guru position is far higher than that of a temple president or even a GVC. So it is natural that if Śrīla Prabhupāda was always consulting Krishna directly for appointing a devotee to any post. Then naturally, Śrīla Prabhupāda wouldn't appoint anyone to Diksha Guru post, without consulting Krishna directly. In other words, all appointments in ISKCON came form Krishna and Śrīla Prabhupāda being the Vāyā media relayed about it.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada consulted Krishna directly about the Ritwik system, and the GBC's duty was to obey Krishna and Srila Prabhupada.

that order from Krishna. Now comes the question. If this is the case, then how do you think Srila Prabhupada appointed the Ritwiks to carry on initiations in ISKCON after his departure? How does the GBC think Srila Prabhupada sent out to all the temple presidents and the GBCs the July 9, 1977 order for implementing the Ritwiks system of initiations in ISKCON? How does the GBC think Srila Prabhupada decided on this order? Do you think Srila Prabhupada simply used this intelligence and discrimination like the GBC did in either inventing the no-objection guru system or the GBC even today is doing in selecting diksha gurus? Do you think Srila Prabhupada did not consult Krishna? In rolling out the July 9, 1977 Ritwik system of initiations order, the answer is obvious. Srila Prabhupada consulted Krishna directly about how initiations would go on in ISKCON particularly at that time when he is no longer with us and Krishna ordered. As per Krishna's order, Srila Prabhupada rolled out the July 9 order to implement Ritwik system of initiations. The duty of the GBC was to disobey Krishna and Shlala Prabhupada was minced.

**Summary:** The GBC is disobeying Srila Prabhupada and Krishna by banning the Rithvik system, which is the Dharma of every devotee and the July 9th order is Shastra.

The GBC is doing? The GBC is disobeying Srila Prabhupada, and Krishna directly. Not only is the GBC itself disobeying Srila Prabhupada, and Krishna, but the GBC is forcing all the devotees of ISKCON in Nandasilam in order to also disobey Krishnan's a visag. If so, they return to resolve Krishnan's problem. Shaila Prabhupada and Krishna in the matter of initiations in ISKCON. Because in the ISKCON law, the GBC has banned anyone from following the Rithvik system of initiations in ISKCON. This is a great offense to Shaila Prabhupada and Krishna. The July 9th, 1977 order of Shaila Prabhupada to implement the Rithvik system of initiations is the direct order of Krishna. And since Dharmamtu Sakshad Bhagavad Praneetham, whatever is ordered by Krishna becomes Dharma, it constitutes Shastra. Following the Rithvik system of initiations in ISKCON is the Dharma of every devotee in ISKCON and the July 9th Rithvik initiation system order is itself Shastra. Let us not be misled otherwise. Hare Krishna, Vishwaguru Shaila Prabhupada ki jai.

**Key Quote:** "When we are taking initiation from Srila Prabhupada, we are accepting Srila Prabhupada as our Diksha Guru, initiating spiritual master, and Prabhupada is also accepting you as his disciple."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the significance of Diksha initiation, emphasizing Srila Prabhupada's role as the Diksha Guru and referencing relevant verses from the Chaitanya Charitamrita.

So today is a very significant day in the lives of the devotees who are taking Diksha initiation. When we are taking initiation from Srila Prabhupada, we are accepting Srila Prabhupada as our Diksha Guru, initiating spiritual master, and Prabhupada is also accepting you as his disciple. It is important to understand what Diksha is, what is initiation. In the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalila, Chapter 4, Chapter 24, verse 333, purport, Srila Prabhupada says that, as far as Diksha is concerned, initiation is concerned, one must refer to the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalila, Chapter 15, verse 108. So in that purport to verse 108 of Chapter 15 of the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalila, Srila Prabhupada elaborately explains about Diksha or initiation.

**Key Quote:** "The process by which transcendental knowledge is revealed within the heart, and by the process by which sinful reactions are destroyed in one's lives, these two things constitute the process of Diksha."
**Summary:** The speaker defines Diksha based on Srila Rupa Goswami's teachings, explaining it as the process of receiving transcendental knowledge (divya jnana) and destroying sinful reactions.

Srila Prabhupada quotes Srila Rupa Goswami and he says that, divyam jnanam yathodadyat kuryat papasya sankshayam, diksheti sa chokta deshikais tatva kovidaihi. What is the definition of Diksha? The definition of Diksha, the word Diksha is taken from two words, di is taken from divya jnana, and ksha is taken from kuryat papasya sankshayam, kshaya. So divyam jnanam yathodadyat, the process by which transcendental knowledge is revealed within the heart, divyam jnanam yathodadyat. Kuryat papasya sankshayam, and by the process by which sinful reactions are destroyed in one's lives. These two things constitute the process of Diksha.

**Key Quote:** "So the process of divya jnana, of Diksha started the day when you started hearing from Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how divya jnana begins with hearing from Srila Prabhupada and progresses through chanting, reading, and gradually giving up sinful habits.

So all of you who are taking Diksha today, you have already received divya jnana in your heart to some extent. The day you came in touch with devotees and somebody gave you a book of Prabhupada and you started reading Prabhupada's books, divya jnana started revealing within your hearts, isn't it? So the process of divya jnana, of Diksha started the day when you started hearing from Srila Prabhupada. And when you started hearing from Srila Prabhupada and you decided to follow his instructions, you might have begun with chanting Hare Krishna Maha Mantra a few times, one mala, then slowly, slowly when you read, you increase your number of malas, then you come to four malas, you are still reading Prabhupada's books, so many things you are understanding. In the beginning, you may not have the understanding that Krishna is Supreme Personality of Godhead, but anyway, I am told to chant Hare Krishna, I am chanting. Some mantra, we chant like that. But as we go on reading Prabhupada's books, we understand, oh yes, Krishna is Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krishna is not like other devatas. So divya jnana has started getting revealed within the heart. And also you understand, I am not the body, I am a spirit soul, I am Atma, I am not the Deha. Divya jnana is getting revealed within the heart. And slowly what happens, you go on reading Prabhupada's books, you keep chanting, by the time you come to chant four rounds, you feel like giving up coffee and tea. And then continue reading Prabhupada's books, continue chanting, by the time you come to eight rounds, onion and garlic goes out of your life. And then slowly, slowly, you come to the stage of chanting sixteen rounds, you start wearing Kanti Mala, you start wearing Tilak, you start fasting for Ekadashi and other festival days.

**Key Quote:** "But then after reading Prabhupada's books, I realized, no, we have to fast."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about his initial experience with fasting, highlighting the challenges and the eventual determination to follow Prabhupada's instructions.

Before coming in touch with Prabhupada and Prabhupada's instructions, some of us might have been fasting, but many of us would not have fasted in our life. I, for that matter, never fasted in my life. Whole life, whenever I wanted to eat anything, I was eating. But then after reading Prabhupada's books, I realized, no, we have to fast. So, first time I fasted on Gaurapurnima day. And I didn't realize, I didn't know what is fasting. Fasting karna hai, fasting karo. By that time, it was afternoon, my stomach was growling. And by evening, I was like, you know, I am going to fall dead now. And I was working in office. Then I had to leave the office. Somehow, I drove the scooter all the way to the temple. I don't know how I drove. And then when I reached the temple, Abhishekam, all those things happened. And then finally reached the Prasadam hall, sat down with great, ah, now relief. Now I am going to eat Prasadam. Half my life is already gone by that time. And I am sitting in front of the plate, waiting when will Prasadam come and fall in the plate. Suddenly, one devotee comes and tells me, what are you sitting there for? Get up, come and serve. Another 25% of my life went out. Serve ah, what? Serve. Anyway, he is calling, I could not say no. I got up and served somehow. And then finally, he sat and had Prasadam. And I was like, oh my God. First time I was, what is this fasting? Never had, had any idea. But you see, when we, when we start following Prabhupada's instructions, we start fasting. Even though the body is demanding, body is craving, I want food, I am hungry. Body is all feeling so tired, so fatigued. No, determination has come. No, I must fast. Why? Because I am not the body. I am not given to the body's demands. So you see, Divya Jnana has started getting revealed within the heart. Meat eating goes out of the life. The coffee and tea goes out. All intoxicants go out. So, this is Kuryat Papasya Sankshayam. Papasya Sankshaya also has started happening.

**Key Quote:** "Papa or the sinful reactions in our life are of two kinds: One is the propensity to perform sinful activities which comes because of our ignorance, and second, the way the sinful reactions manifest is in the form of suffering."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of sinful reactions, dividing them into the propensity to sin and the suffering they cause, further categorizing suffering into Prarabdha and Aprarabdha Karma.

So why? Because, Papa or the sinful reactions in our life are of two kinds. One is the propensity to perform sinful activities which comes by our, because of our ignorance. And because of our ignorance, that thinking that I am the body, I am not a spirit soul, we have committed so many sinful activities in our past life. So we get the propensity to perform sinful activities in our current life also, which is the result of sinful activities in our past lives. And second, the way the sinful reactions manifest is in the form of suffering. So there is suffering and when we speak of suffering on account of our accumulated sinful activities, reactions in our past lives, it again manifests in two types. One is Prarabdha Karma and another is Aprarabdha Karma. Prarabdha Karma means the results which are already manifested. This body which I have got is the result of my past activities. It is Prarabdha Karma. I have got a certain mind and intelligence that is the result of Prarabdha Karma. I might be suffering from some disease that is the result of my Prarabdha Karma. That means it is already manifest. I am already, I am already either enjoying or suffering the fruit of my past activity. The second type of sinful reaction is Aprarabdha Karma. Aprarabdha Karmam Kutam Bijam Falon Mukam. This Aprarabdha Karma is of three kinds. One is, it is in seed form. Another is sprouting. Another is the fruit which is not yet ripe. So the, when the sinful reactions in our life are accumulated like a mountain, they are all like the bija, like the seeds which you have accumulated within a jar of seeds. So when you keep the seeds in the jar, they will remain as it is.

**Key Quote:** "So when you keep the seeds in the jar, they will remain as it is. Now you take out the seed and put it into the soil, put a little water, put a little manure. What will happen? After a few days, you will see it sprouting."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of seeds, sprouting plants, and unripe fruits, the speaker explains the different stages of Aprarabdha Karma and how the spiritual master helps remove the propensity for sinful activities by guiding followers to adopt the four regulative principles.

Now you take out the seed and put it into the soil, put a little water, put a little manure. What will happen? After a few days, you will see it sprouting. So that is called Kuta. Bijam Kutam Falon Mukam. Kuta, bija is in the seed form. When the situations in your life become favorable for that seed to start sprouting, it will become like a, it will be, it will start sprouting. That sprouted plant is called Kuta. And then, the plant will grow. And after a little while, it will start giving fruits. That fruit, when it is still unripened, it is called Fala Unmukha. That means, the result is going to come. So just like suppose, I go and admit myself in engineering college. So I have just admitted myself in the college. That means in four years, the fruit of my admitting in the engineering college is going to come in the form of the degree. So, the moment I admit myself into the engineering college, my engineering degree is Fala Unmukha. It is going to come. And then finally, there is the ripened fruit, which is Prarabdha Karma. So, when we, when, so the spiritual master in your life until now, he has been giving you Divya Jnana. And he is also Kuryat Papasya Sankshayam. He is taking away the sinful reactions in your life by removing your propensities, to perform sinful activities. That is why you have started following the four regulated principles: no meat eating, no intoxication, no gambling, no illicit sex.

**Key Quote:** "So real initiation begins from the day you start hearing from the spiritual master, from Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that real initiation begins with hearing from Srila Prabhupada and making a firm determination to follow his instructions, distinguishing this from the formal Diksha ceremony.

Before you came in touch with Prabhupada's books, Prabhupada's instructions, Prabhupada's teachings, we might have been engaging in all those sinful activities. But after reading Prabhupada's books, we feel, no, I should not do that. That means the propensity was there in you, but that has been removed by Srila Prabhupada. So therefore, he has already given, put you on the, into the process of Diksha or initiation. So real initiation begins from the day you start hearing from the spiritual master, from Srila Prabhupada. And when you take the determination, when you are determined, when you read Prabhupada's books, you have to chant 16 malas, you have to follow the four regulated principles, you have to fast on Ekadashi, what happens? You start, you feel, yes, I should follow that. That determination actually constitutes Diksha or initiation. And what ceremony we are undergoing right now, where there is a fire sacrifice, you will receive a new spiritual name, you will receive beads chanted on by the Ritvik on behalf of Prabhupada, this is the formal part or the official part of Diksha. So somebody may say, then I can undergo real initiation, I will read Prabhupada's books, I will follow all his instructions, why do I have to undergo formal Diksha? Why do I need to undergo the ceremony? I will keep following whole my life. Prabhupada says that if you, as long as you are following Prabhupada's instructions and in your heart you have accepted Prabhupada as your spiritual master, as your Diksha Guru, you are as good as his disciple, but you are not yet his disciple.

**Key Quote:** "Your commitment to Srila Prabhupada goes a step higher."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of the formal Diksha ceremony, highlighting the increased commitment to Srila Prabhupada, the removal of accumulated sinful reactions, and the creation of an eternal bond.

So when you undergo Diksha, undergo the official ceremony, what happens? Your commitment to Srila Prabhupada goes a step higher. When you are sitting in the formal ceremony, what are you committing? You are committing that, I am going to accept Prabhupada as my Diksha Guru, life after life, eternally. Eternally, Prabhupada is my only sole Diksha Guru. This is the commitment you are making from your side. There is no going back from here. There is no point of no return. You cannot go back tomorrow and say that, no, I made a mistake, I want to take Diksha from someone else. No. Not in this life, not in a hundred life henceforth, not even after you go back to the spiritual world. Now from this point onwards, once you have taken formal official Diksha, even when you go to the spiritual world, there also Srila Prabhupada will be guiding you as your Diksha Guru. That is the meaning of eternally you are accepting him as your Diksha Guru. And from Prabhupada's side, he is acting as your Diksha Guru. What he does, the moment you are sitting for this formal Diksha, Prabhupada says, when you take the first initiation, Prabhupada takes away all your sinful reactions. How does Prabhupada take away all your sinful reactions? Already he has taken away all your propensity to perform sinful activities. No. Kuryat Papasanksham has already done to one extent. But all your accumulated sinful reactions in all the past lives, aprarabdha karma, sitting as Bija, Kuta, Phalamukha, where will that go? And your prarabdha karma, you have got a body and a mind and intelligence, where will that go? That also has to go, when you take formal initiation from Prabhupada, at that time, Prabhupada will take away all the prarabdha and aprarabdha karma also. Not only the propensity to perform sinful activity, Prabhupada will also take away all your accumulated sinful reactions.

**Key Quote:** "You become liable to be punished if you commit sinful activity again."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the increased responsibility that comes with formal Diksha, explaining that disciples become liable to punishment for breaking their vows and deviating from Prabhupada's instructions.

A disciple, once he has taken formal diksha from Prabhupada, once you have formally sat in the ceremony and you have taken diksha from Prabhupada, what happens? One is the eternal bond is created. Second is Prabhupada takes away all your accumulated sinful reactions. Third, what happens is, therefore, you become liable. You become liable to be punished if you commit sinful activity again. See, until you undergo formal initiation, until you undergo formal diksha from Prabhupada, suppose you followed all the four regulative principles, you were chanting sixteen malas for one year, after that, somehow, you fell down. You gave up. You started, you stopped following the four regulative principles, you stopped chanting sixteen malas. What will happen? Whatever you have done for that one year is to your eternal credit. You will get some sukruti. That's all. And loss of karma will take over. Whatever activity, punya karma, papa karma you do, go on. That much only will happen. You will get an eternal credit. You will get sukruti for whatever you have followed. But once you take formal diksha, after that, if you don't chant your rounds or you break the regulative principles, what happens? You are liable to be punished. If you don't follow, if you break, you will be punished by your diksha guru, Prabhupada and by Krishna. Until that point of time, no punishment. You are only getting sukruti. You are only getting blessing. Now blessing will be hitting also. If you disobey, if you break your vow, because in a formal ceremony what you are doing, you are sitting in front of Agni, you are sitting in front of all Vaishnavas, you are sitting in front of the Deity, and you are taking a vow that you will follow Prabhupada's instructions without fail.

#### holy name, parampara, eternal bond, consciousness

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The holy name is officially getting delivered to you from the parampara. Therefore, the holy name will act more powerfully in your life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of receiving beads chanted on by the Ritvik, emphasizing the delivery of the holy name from the parampara, the creation of an eternal bond with Prabhupada, and the shift in consciousness from material to spiritual.

You become liable to be punished. And Prabhupada also says, when the Rithvik has chanted on your beads, until now you are chanting, you are chanting on beads only. But what is the significance of the Rithvik chanting on the bead and that bead is being given to you? There are two significances. One is, the holy name is being delivered to you from the parampara. Until now you are chanting the holy name. Okay, no problem. The holy name was acting in your life. But now, the holy name is officially getting delivered to you from the parampara. Therefore, the holy name will act more powerfully in your life. Now, from now on when you chant Hare Krishna Mantra, that holy name will have a much more powerful effect in purifying you and taking you back to Godhead. Second thing is, that when the Rithvik has chanted on the beads and that bead is given to you, what actually it creates is, it creates an eternal bind between you and Prabhupada, as Prabhupada is your spiritual master and you as his disciple. This is the significance of the Rithvik chanting on the beads on behalf of Prabhupada and giving it to you. And as a… Now that all your prarabdha and aprarabdha karma is taken away from you, you are actually getting a new birth. You may not feel it. You may think, I am feeling the same. It is not there. It is not a matter of feeling. It is a matter of consciousness. Because you have to understand, until now, before we took initiation from Prabhupada, our consciousness was different. What was that? Sense gratification is the goal of my life. Now, when you are taking diksha from Prabhupada, what is your consciousness? Your life and substance is Prabhupada's vani, Prabhupada's instructions. Whatever Prabhupada has ordered, that is my life. And just like life cannot be separated from the body and if the life is separated from the body, then the body becomes useless. It becomes a dead body. Like that, my soul existence, I exist now only for carrying out Prabhupada's instructions because he is my diksha guru now. So my Guru Maharaj, Prabhupada's instructions are my life and soul now. For me, material sense gratification doesn't matter, material name, fame, wealth, these things are immaterial for me now. For me, what is now soul thing in my life is carrying out the instructions of my spiritual master, my Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada. So your consciousness has changed, you see. Your consciousness has gone from material consciousness to spiritual consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "Now your subtle body is working spiritually. Goals have changed. Your purpose of life has changed."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that formal diksha changes the subtle body from material to spiritual, giving the initiate a brahmana body and shifting their consciousness towards spiritual goals.

How is this possible? Until and unless your subtle body is changed. Your subtle body until now was materially working. Now your subtle body is working spiritually. Goals have changed. Your purpose of life has changed. Your outlook towards life has changed. The way you perceive the material world and other people around you has changed. How this is possible? That's because your material subtle body which you have got because of your prarabdha karma is now removed and you are given a new spiritual body. You are given a brahmana body. Actually you are given a brahmana body now. So you are able to think like a brahmana because now you think in terms of shastra, right? You see, when you have a, when there is a in sanatana dharma when there is a shudra, vaishya, kshatriya they all think in terms of the body. They think in terms of sense gratification. They think in terms of fame. Shudra, simply sense gratification. Vaishya is more into hoarding money. He is interested in wealth. Kshatriya is interested in name and fame. So all revolving around the body. What does brahmana think? Brahmana's thinking, his consciousness is I have to attain moksha. I have to attain liberation. I have to know who that brahman is. So his thinking is on the spiritual platform. So now you are also thinking like that. What is your thinking? Your thinking now is my goal in life is I have to go back to Godhead. So this is how a brahmana thinks. A brahmana is not interested in sense gratification. Brahmana is not interested in doing any sinful activity. He very rigidly follows the shastra. For him, shastra is the most important. Vani of his guru is most important.

**Key Quote:** "So you were born in Kali Yuga with a Shudra body. Now Prabhupada has taken that away and given you a subtle brahmana body. So this is your second birth."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Prabhupada takes away the subtle Shudra body and gives a subtle brahmana body, signifying a second birth and the reason for receiving a new spiritual name.

So that means Prabhupada has taken away your praarabdha karma also. Praarabdha karma, Prabhupada is anyway taking away. Kootam, bijam, phalaunmukam. Prabhupada is also taking your praarabdha karma away. Because externally, the gross body that we have got, that's not the real thing. The real thing is the subtle body. How the subtle body works. So the subtle body has been your current subtle body. In Kali Yuga, everyone is born as Shudra. Even if somebody is born in a brahmana family, he is also a Shudra only. Kalau Shudra Sambhava. So you were born in Kali Yuga with a Shudra body. Now Prabhupada has taken that away and given you a subtle brahmana body. So this is your second birth. And so therefore, to signify the second birth, you are given a spiritual name. You are given a new name. You got this praarabdha karma of this body, with its subtle body, gross and subtle body, by taking birth from your mother and father. So you got a name from them. Now, Prabhupada is giving you a new birth by taking away all your past praarabdha and aprarabdha karma. And so therefore, you are getting a new spiritual name. So this is a second birth for all of you who are taking initiation. And Prabhupada says that this formal initiation ceremony is like, it is like getting, filling up the admission form when you go to school or college. So when you go to school or college, you fill in an admission form.

**Key Quote:** "Formal initiation also, it is a formality. It is like getting admitted into the college. Now, don't bunk."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of college admission, the speaker emphasizes the importance of following the spiritual master's instructions without question after formal initiation.

I also did, start bunking classes. And tell one of our friends, go and put proxy attendance. Then, although you have got admitted in the college, you really are not a student. If you are really a student, you should go and sit in the classes. You have to be attentive to the classes. You should be absorbing the lessons. You should be learning. That mood of yours, that determination of yours, I have come to the college to learn, not to bunk and go out and party with my friends. That's not my goal. I have come to the college, I have filled in the admission because I want to sit and learn something. Then you are a real student. Similarly, formal initiation also, it is a formality. It is like getting admitted into the college. Now, don't bunk. Right? Don't bunk and go and party with friends. You should follow all the rules and regulations. You should follow the instructions of the spiritual master. Order of Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada is your life and soul now. Alright? So, whatever Prabhupada has ordered, you have to follow that implicitly. No question. No question. There is no question of asking. Until now, you could have asked. Prabhupada says this. So, let me find out whether it is asked for Shastra or not. Until now, you could have asked that question. From now onwards, you cannot ask that question. Prabhupada's order, end of it. You cannot ask for Shastric evidence and all that. Where is Shastric evidence for Prabhupada's order? Where is tradition in Prabhupada's order? Now, you cannot ask that question. Prabhupada's order is your life and substance. Shastra, tradition, your understanding, not understanding, all your logic, your arguments, you want to understand how it is correct, incorrect, all that is secondary. Whether you understand or not, whether you are going to be delivered or not, are you going back to Godhead or not, all those considerations are thrown out of the window. No more consideration. Your only consideration now is, I have to follow Prabhupada's orders in my life. Period. This is the meaning of Diksha.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that true initiation requires unwavering commitment and loyalty to the Guru, which pleases the Guru and ultimately pleases Krishna, ensuring a smooth path back to Godhead.

If you are determined like this, then, you are not only formally initiated, you are also actually initiated. Otherwise, if you get, if you sit in the formal Diksha ceremony, got initiated, after initiation, if you say, Prabhupada is saying like this, but Shastra is saying something else, science is saying something else, who knows whether it is right or not, then, you are only filled in the admission form, but you are bunking the classes. So, you are not, you are not really eligible to sit in the exam to go back to Godhead. You understand? So, therefore, you have, you have to understand the significance of formal Diksha. It involves many things. It involves your commitment to Prabhupada and Prabhupada's commitment to you to take you back to Godhead, provided you fulfill all the conditions from your side. It is a two-way contract, eternally binding you to Prabhupada. So, remain determined to follow Prabhupada's warning, Prabhupada's instructions, Prabhupada's orders and that is your life and soul from this point onwards and Prabhupada is your whole, you know, is your soul Diksha Guru, life after life and you will definitely progress on the path back to Godhead. You don't have to worry about going back to Godhead, whether I will go back to Godhead or not. None of those considerations have to be there. Simply, right now, from now on, your only thinking and duty is, how to execute the orders of Srila Prabhupada. That's all. How to purify you, when to take you back to Godhead, how many lifetimes after which to take you back to Godhead, will I take three lifetimes like Jaya and Vijaya or will I take two lifetimes like Bharat Maharaj or will I go back within six months like Dhruva Maharaj, you don't have to consider all that. Your own, no matter, even if I have to take one thousand lifetimes or one million lifetimes again and again, I have to take birth within the material world, no problem. Even in every single of those million lifetimes also, I'll keep following Prabhupada's instructions, my Guru Maharaj's instructions. This should be your determination. This is the, this is what really makes you a disciple and this is what pleases Prabhupada as your Diksha Guru. This attitude of a devotee, unquestioning loyalty, this unquestioning paraabhakti towards Guru, is what pleases Guru. And if Prabhupada, your Diksha Guru, is pleased with this, yasya prasadad bhagavad prasadad, then Krishna will be pleased with you. And if Krishna is pleased with you, your going back to Godhead is not an issue at all. Comfortably, without your putting any endeavor.

**Key Quote:** "But the kind of breezes that started blowing when Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyakashipu appeared, they were Suddhusvarsha and they were Phutkaaraan Eerein."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the breeze that blew at the time of the demons' birth was unpleasant and hissing, unlike the pleasant breeze of Chennai.

So it is described here. Vavavvayu. Vayu, the air. A breeze which blows. Winds which blow. Normally in Chennai what happens, it's very humid. So when we stand outside in the tree shade, there is a breeze that blows. It feels very pleasing. It feels very nice, cooling, comforting. But the kind of breezes that started blowing when Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyakashipu appeared, they were Suddhusvarsha and they were Phutkaaraan Eerein. When the wind used to blow, when Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyakashipu were going to take birth, the breeze used to give a hissing sound. And just like you would see in if any of you before joining you have seen these horror movies, sometimes in the night they will show one window is closing, one door is closing and there is a kind of sound that comes which is very fearful. Those kind of sounds are not pleasing to the ear. And Suddhusvarsha, to the touch also, the breeze was not pleasing. So, especially when you are in Chennai, you don't have experience of breeze which is unpleasant. Isn't it?

**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal experience of arriving in Vrindavan in winter and being overwhelmed by the cold breeze.

Any time breeze blows, it's welcome. But you know, I have also been, you know, I was born and grew up in South India. So, when I went to Vrindavan, I went in 2005. So, and unfortunately I went in February. You know, January, February is the coldest season in Vrindavan. So, I had no idea how winter is in the North India. Never went out of South India. You know, Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, these were the areas which I used to roam until I joined the temple and then went to Vrindavan. So, I had no idea how winters are in the North India. Maximum winter I got exposed to was in Bangalore, you know. Maximum it would go down to 20 degrees, 22 degrees. And in Vrindavan, you know how winters are. The maximum daytime temperature at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the afternoon will be around 5 degrees or 6 degrees. That's the kind of winter. So, I had no idea. So, you know, we got into a car from the airport and drove down to Vrindavan. And our Vrindavan Chandravadey Mandir site that is there. At that time, of course, it's not like this currently. It was just plain land. There was absolutely nothing. The torus which you see now, it was still coming. So, I went and landed there. Got out of the car. As soon as I got out of the car, I immediately got back inside. There was a very cold... As it is, the temperature was cold. On top of that, a cold breeze was blowing. The moment it touched my skin, that's all. I couldn't get out of the car. I immediately jumped back inside the car. I said, I am not going to get out. Then, you know, with me other, Vyopat Prabhu and other devotees were there. They said, hey, if you don't get out, you look very bad. I see all the embassies, they are standing there. Come on, get out. So, with great difficulty, I managed to get out. So, there are breezes also which are not pleasant. So, sometimes, you know, in the extreme winter, when the breeze blows, it is not pleasing.

**Key Quote:** "And I was feeling somebody has set fire to my body."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal experience of the intense heat and unpleasant breeze during his first summer in Vrindavan.

Similarly, my first summer in Vrindavan, I still remember. Summer also, I never experienced. You know, in Bangalore, temperatures those days, maximum 28, 29. 30 was unheard of in Bangalore, those days. Nowadays, of course, it goes to 35, 36 and all that. So, when summer came, June, May, June, temperatures were sizzling, 48 degrees centigrade. I had never experienced in my life. And those days, we were not staying in the campus. We were staying outside. So, we used to come every day and go. And we used to come by bike. So, another devotee used to drive the bike. And I used to sit behind. So, in the afternoon for lunch, Prasadam, we had to go back. So, we used to stay in that Keshav Kunj, which was opposite the Krishnabal Ram temple. So, from, you can imagine, from Chattikara till there, we had to go in 48 degrees centigrade. And we were, when we were driving, the breeze was blowing. And I was feeling somebody has set fire to my body. So, at that time, breeze was not pleasing. I was thinking, when will this breeze stop? So, sometimes, breezes are not pleasing to the skin. So, it is said here, that when Hiranyaksha and, of course, in certain climates, certain weathers, the breeze may not be pleasing. But when Karthik Maas comes, when Chaitanya Maas comes, that time, the breeze is very pleasing. So, but then, when Hiranyaksha and Hiranyaka Kshapu were taking birth, the entire climate itself became so bad, that the breeze became, became distrustful, became uninviting to the touch.

**Key Quote:** "When that becomes prominent in this material world, what happens is, all the entire system around which this whole material universe is designed gets disrupted."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the unpleasant breeze and other disturbances to the increasing demoniac influence and exploitation of material nature.

And the sound that they were giving was also not pleasing to the ears. And what was happening, Vathani Ko, Vathya means, there was a, you know, these cyclones and hurricanes had become very common. So, which is what we are experiencing now. Every other day, there is a cyclone. Just recently, you know, Chennai has gone through one cyclone. Still not got over the, still the cyclone hangover is still going on. Still continuously raining. And a few years back, we had the big tsunami. And I think a couple of years back, we had a big flood also here. So, these kind of natural disturbances are actually, if you see, they are not meant to be in this world. It is not that this world is like this. No, this world is not like this. Not supposed to be like this. This world, Krishna has created in such a way, that it is supposed to be very pleasing and giving lot of peace and comfort to us. In our minds, as long as we are executing spiritual activities. The moment we go against the will of Krishna, we go against the laws of nature, we start trying to exploit material nature. Material nature as well as other living entities. When that becomes prominent in this material world, what happens is, all the entire system around which this whole material universe is designed gets disrupted. And when that gets disrupted, all these kind of natural disturbances become very prominent.

**Key Quote:** "A pure breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch, and bearing the aroma of flowers."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the omens at the time of the demons' birth with the pure and fragrant breeze that blew when Krishna appeared.

So, it is described here, When the breeze was blowing, it was very uninviting to the touch. That's how it is described when Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu were going to take birth. Because they were great demons. They were enemies of Vishnu. Now, on the other hand, in the tenth canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a description of what was the prevailing situation when Krishna was going to appear. So, the same words, Vavavvayuhu is used even when Krishna appeared. But when Krishna appeared, I'll just read that verse. When Krishna appeared, the Srimad Bhagavatam, it says, Vavavvayuhu suhasparsha. You see, when Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu came, Vavavvayuhu sudhasparsha. And when Krishna was going to appear, Vavavvayuhu suhasparsha. And then, Punyagandhavahasuchihi, Agnayastha, Dvijatina, Chandastatra samindhata. So, what it means is, I'll read the translation. A pure breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch, and bearing the aroma of flowers. Can you imagine that? It was bearing the aroma of flowers. And when the brahmanas, engaging in ritualistic ceremonies, ignited their fires, according to Vedic principles,

**Key Quote:** "The earth produces enough to satisfy the needs of a man, but not the greed of a man."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts modern cities with Vedic cities, emphasizing the importance of living in harmony with nature and avoiding greed.

the fires burned steadily. The fires were not getting extinguished. They were burning steadily despite the breeze. Why? Because the breeze was favorable. That was why it was carrying aroma of flowers. Nowadays, you go into the city, you will get nice breeze along with that, you will get nice aroma also. Of what? You will get aroma of sewage. Unfortunately, that's the way our modern cities are designed. There hardly you'll find any gardens, hardly you'll find any flowering plants. It's very difficult nowadays. But then, in the olden days, the cities were designed in such a way that every city would have beautiful parks, gardens. That used to be the center of every city. But nowadays, we have big, big concrete buildings, and very dense populations. Because of which, what happens? You have to have, you know, all the sewage gets collected, and all those kind of things start happening. So, even though big, big cities were there in the estuaries, in the Vedic times, still, the whole city would be very beautiful and very pleasing to walk around. The breeze, the plants, the fruits, the trees, everything would be very pleasing. Actually, human society is supposed to live in this manner, in harmony with material nature. And in the Vedic times, the whole civilization was, the consciousness of the civilization was how to utilize this human form of life to advance in spiritual life. So, whereas in the current day world, the whole consciousness of the civilization is how to exploit material nature and maximize my sense gratification. So, material nature, if we live according to the laws of material nature, there is ample opportunity for sense gratification, but not for unlimited, unrestricted sense enjoyment. In a limited, restricted way, in the manner it is mentioned in the Vedas, sense enjoyment is there, not that it is not there. But then, as it is said, the earth produces enough to satisfy the needs of a man, but not the greed of a man.

**Key Quote:** "Material nature also starts reacting."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that sinful activities lead to reactions from material nature, making the world an unbearable place to live.

Now, the whole civilization, human civilization has become so greedy for sense gratification that all the laws of material nature are discarded. And we try to exploit and exploit and exploit material nature because of what happens? Material nature also starts reacting. So, as Prabhupada is mentioning, the demoniac people who are accustomed to all kinds of forbidden sinful activities, they will create such a situation that the material world becomes an unbearable place to live in. So, we have to understand that we are accountable for our actions. Whatever I do, there will be some reaction involved. If the civilization is engaged in sinful activities, then material nature will give suitable reaction. We will not be able to enjoy. We will not be able to enjoy very happily. Just like if there is a criminal, and if he thinks, I will engage in all sorts of anti-social activities, and I will steal, I will rob people, and with that money, I will enjoy. It is not possible. Why? Because the police department will start running after him. And they will not allow him to live peacefully. They will go behind him until he is behind the bars. So, in a similar way, if the whole civilization is trying to go against the, orders, against the order of material nature, which has been given by Krishna or Vishnu, then what will happen? Then we will not be allowed to live peacefully. We will have to. There will be various reactions that will come. We may increase our comforts, our conveniences. We may invent many, many material, scientific inventions we may create, to give us more comforts, to give us more sense gratification. But what will happen? Material nature will make the situation worse and worse. Even though our conveniences, material conveniences increase, what will happen? Material nature will also keep increasing the pressure on us, by which we will not be able to happily enjoy those conveniences. Some pandemic will come, some cyclone will come, some flood will come, some tsunami will come. Actually, if you see, the amount of sinful activities in this material world is growing. That's how Kali Yuga is. In Kali Yuga, the sinful activities of the people keep on increasing.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the turmoil in the world and contrasts it with the steadiness present when the civilization is directed towards Krishna consciousness.

That's how you see, the whole material world, actually, this year especially, if you see, this whole world has been in total turmoil. It began with the, with the, with the pandemic. Then in the United States, there was an election. There also turmoil. And you see, in Chennai, there is cyclone, turmoil. And now, in Yelur, Andhra Pradesh, some unknown disease. Some 300 people are in the hospital. Two, three people have died. Again, turmoil. Everywhere it is, it is, you know, there is no political stability. There is no environmental stability. People's jobs, there is no stability. If you go everywhere, people are saying, tens of lakhs of people have lost their jobs due to the pandemic. So, there is no stability anywhere. Whereas, you see, how the Bhagavatam is describing, when Krishna was going to appear, even the sacrificial fire, even though breeze is blowing, was very steady. So, to that extent, steadiness is there, when the whole civilization is directed towards Krishna consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "It is incumbent upon us, to live our life, free of sinful activities."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of living a life free of sinful activities to achieve peace and align with material nature.

So, we have to understand, that, at the civilizational level, whether at the global level, or at the national level, or at the individual level, even an individual, if he engages in sinful activities, he cannot expect to remain happy with the results of those sinful actions. So, this is, actually, this is the real fact, which people become blind to, people are blind to, they are not able to appreciate, they are not able to see this. That if I commit sinful activities, they will have to suffer. And, if as a civilization, we engage in sinful activities, thinking that we will make all the arrangements for sinful activities, and we will manage the show, no. Whether at the individual level, or at the civilizational level, it is incumbent upon us, to live our life, free of sinful activities. Otherwise, we are bound to be in a situation where, we will not be peaceful. So, what we have to understand is, that, the human life, is meant to, meant for a higher purpose. And, that higher purpose, is achievable only in the human form of life. And, if we live our life, according to that goal, then, what happens is, the whole material world, the material nature, will align itself, to our activities, it will, it will, it will only, enhance our efforts, progress in that direction. It will not oppose us. When we engage in sinful activities, then material nature will oppose. It will oppose very vehemently. Whereas, if we engage in, achieving the ultimate goal of life, as described in the Vedas, then what happens, material nature will become very favorable, and it will help us, to progress in that direction. It will not oppose us.

**Summary:** The speaker laments that the ultimate goal of life in the modern world is money and introduces the conversation between Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Ramananda Raya about the true goal of life.

So, what is that ultimate goal of life? Unfortunately, today, in the modern day world, people don't know, what is the ultimate goal of life. Ultimate goal of life, in today's world is, money, money, money, sweeter than honey. Unfortunately, that's our, eat, drink, and be merry. You can eat and drink, but you cannot be merry. If you drink also, next day morning, when you get up, you will have such a headache. Where is merry? All gone. And when you are fully drunk, you don't know, what you are talking, what you are doing, nothing you will remember. Where is merry? So, you may say, eat, drink, and be merry, but actually, you cannot be merry. So, what is the ultimate goal of life? Actually, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, met Ramananda Raya, on the banks of the Godavari, so, he said, Krishna Balram, so, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu met, Ramananda Raya, on the banks of Godavari, Ramananda Raya, Ramananda Raya, was the governor, of Vidyanagara. Vidyanagara, at that time, is today's, I think, this one, Vishakaparnam. Am I right? So, there, he happened to, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, happened to meet, Ramananda Raya. So, Ramananda Raya, because he was the governor, naturally, governor will not come, you know, alone to the Godavari, people used to go to the river, to take bath, and all that. So, Ramananda Raya, came there. And, naturally, he was, being carried in a, palanquin, and there were lot of Brahmanas, and Vedic mantras, and there were all his assistants, and all those kind of people, who had come, along with him. And so, then, there, he saw Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, had also come there, and both of them, met there. And then, but then, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, did not want to discuss, too much with him, surrounding him, and he had come, in a very official manner. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, invited, invited Ramananda Raya, you come to, I am staying in one Brahmana's house, here. So, you come and meet me, in the evening. So, Ramananda Raya, in the evening, came and met Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, all alone. Just one assistant, he brought with him, and he came all alone, and met Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So, when Chaitanya, so, actually, who was this Ramananda Raya? Ramananda Raya, is, the niece, of, of Krishna. So, Lalitha and Vishakha, are the, are the, are the, after Radharani, Lalitha and Vishakha, are the next Gopis. So, Vishakha Gopi, had incarnated as, Ramananda Raya. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, asked Ramananda Raya, what is the ultimate goal, of life? It's a very important question, because, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu knows, in the earlier, Vedic civilization, everybody knew, goal of life means, we have to attain Mukti, we have to go back, to Godhead, that used to be, a common knowledge, but in Kali Yuga, nobody knows, what is the ultimate goal, of life. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu asked, Ramananda Raya, can you please tell me, what is the goal of life? It is not that, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu knows, but he wanted, an answer from, Ramananda Raya, for the benefit of, the general mass of people.

What is that, after that? Sthane Sthitah, Tanuang Nobher, Prayaso Ajitajitopya, Sitayis Trilokyam. So, Brahma Ji said, Jnane Prayasam, to engage in the process of Jnana, is, Prayasam, it is simply hard labor, there is no, result that comes out of it. No, real spiritual benefit that comes out of, undertaking the path of Jnana Yoga. Udapasi, so reject the process of Jnana Yoga. Jnane Prayasam, Udapasi, Namantayeva, so, to surrender to Krishna, by rejecting Jnana Yoga, and, Sanmukharitam, Bhavadiyava Vartam, to constantly hear your glories, submitting his prayers to Lord Krishna. So, to hear Krishna's glories, being described by devotees, that is the highest goal. And, by doing this, what happens is, Thane Sita, wherever you are situated, you may be a Brahmana, you may be a Kshatriya, you may be a Vaishya, you may be a, you may be, you may be a Sanyasi, you may be a Grihasta, you may be Brahmachari, Manaprasad, whatever you are, whichever situation you are, engage in glorifying Krishna, in the association of devotees, and by this, what happens is, Krishna is Ajitha, Ajitha Jithopiasi, Krishna is Ajitha, Ajitha means, nobody can conquer Krishna, that unconquerable Krishna, becomes Jitha, Ajitha Jithopiasi, he becomes conquered, simply by, glorifying Krishna, in the association of devotees. So, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu heard this, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, Eho Yaha, now what you are saying makes sense. Why? Because, now there is some activity, spiritual activity. What is that? To glorify Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "In Kali Yuga, the process of spiritual emancipation is, to glorify Krishna, in the association of other devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of glorifying Krishna in the association of devotees (Satamprasangat) in Kali Yuga and explains why ISKCON and other institutions are necessary.

So, what happens is, this is a very powerful process, especially in Kali Yuga. What is that? That, we engage in glorifying Krishna, Satamprasangat, in association of other devotees. Satamprasangat means, in the association of pure devotees, and in a group, as a group, we engage in glorifying Krishna. So, this process, is very, very powerful. So, that is why, the Bhagavatam, actually if you see, the Bhagavatam, is, in many, many places, you will find, from the beginning till the end, the Bhagavatam is pushing this, principle, that is, is exposing this principle, is again and again, reiterating this principle, that, in Kali Yuga, the process, the process of spiritual emancipation is, to glorify Krishna, in the association of other devotees. In the earlier ages, we could perform spiritual activities, all alone. Bharat Maharaj, he gave up his whole kingdom, and he went to the forest, and practiced Bhakti, all alone. And he reached the stage of Bhavabhakti. And later on, of course, he again took the birth of Jadabharata, and continued. He did not join, and, you know, in a group, and became a Bhakta, and started getting trained, and all that. You know, he went to the forest, and he practiced. Dhruva Maharaj, at the age of 5 years, he went to the forest, all alone, and practiced. And within 6 months, he achieved perfection. And, we all in Kali Yuga, you know, we come and join, he is gone 24, 26 years old, and 20 years will pass, but still, we will, you know, we will be in, you know, we will never, you know, what he achieved. But then, Dhruva Maharaj did it all alone. He went to Dhrotila, in Vrindavan, and he practiced. In 6 months, he had Darshan of Vishnu. You take the case of Narada Muni, Narada Muni also, for a few months, during Chaturma, for 4 months, he served all the pure devotees. After that, he went to the forest, and practiced on his own, all alone. Whereas, in Kali Yuga, if you try to do that, all these great personalities, they went to the forest, executed Bhakti, and overcame Maya. If in Kali Yuga, we try to do, first of all, you will not find a forest. Even if you find a forest, you go there, he will not overcome Maya, Maya will overcome us. So, it is not possible in Kali Yuga, to practice Krishna Consciousness, all alone. So, in the olden ages, it used to be possible. That's why, in the olden age, there was no ISKCON, there was no organization. It's not that, Panacharya had to create an organization, and everybody would come and practice. This is a very novel thing, which is happening only in Kali Yuga, which was started by Shri Krishna. And this is not unique only to our Sampradaya, Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya. Even Madhavacharya had an institution. Even Ramadhyacharya started an institution. Because, in Kali Yuga, you have to have an institutional place, where devotees can all come together, and jointly they can practice.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is actually building up our spiritual strength."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Prabhupada's Sadhana program and how it builds spiritual strength to protect against Maya in Kali Yuga.

And that is how Prabhupada made a whole program, where we all get together, in the morning we get up, all of us come together in the temple hall, assemble together, and then we sing Samsara Dhaman Leda. And then what we do, we all sit in the temple hall, and together we chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. And then, together we do Guru Poja. Together we all sit and hear Bhagavatam class. When, you know, in the olden ages, where was this kind of system? Dhruva Maharaj or Bharat Maharaj, they were not sitting in the forest and, you know, gathering lot of people, and together let us, you know, have Bhagavatam class daily. No, they were not having. Okay, only the sages got together in Naimisharanya, because they were conducting a special sacrifice. So, they together all got together and they heard. Because anyway it was the beginning of Kali Yuga. So, they actually set the precedence. That in Kali Yuga, all of, all the sages got together and heard Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is there all the time. So, only in Kali Yuga, hearing Bhagavatam, process of hearing Bhagavatam is Satamprasangat. You have to do it in the association of others. Alone, we will not be able to do it. We will not be able to sustain. And that is why, Prabhupada has created a whole Sadhana program, where we all come together, and together we hear Bhagavatam, together we chant Hare Krishna Mantra, together we do Sankirtana. And this is the process for Kali Yuga, which is very, very powerful. And simply by engaging in this process, what happens is, we gain strength from each other, and we will be able to very quickly make progress in spiritual life. Otherwise, in Kali Yuga especially, it is very, very difficult to progress in spiritual life. To be able to protect ourselves from the forces of Maya is very, very tough. It is not at all easy. Maya is very powerful, and we are very weak. In the earlier ages, what used to happen, Maya used to be less powerful, and people used to be much stronger spiritually. Now the roles have reversed. So, therefore, we have to, you know, together we have to face the force of Maya. So we stay in the same ashram, we come and practice spiritual life together. So what happens is, in the temple, temple is a very protected environment, where the force of Maya is practically not there. So, this association of devotees, we have to appreciate, and we have to value that, you know, what Prabhupada has given us in the form of this institution, in this form of, in the form of the opportunity to be able to, be able to practice the principles of the Bhagavatam, in the manner it is described in the Bhagavatam. In the association, in a group, every day, day after day, we go on practicing. This is actually building up our spiritual strength. And this is what is required for Kalyuga. So, with these few words, I will stop. If there are any questions or comments,

**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about how distress can lead some people to spirituality while others become averse, explaining that it depends on whether a person is a Punyatma.

we can discuss. Yes, please. Yes. Harikrishna, Prabhupada. Harikrishna. Generally, like, when the people you peacefully, they can be able to think of spirituality. Yeah. But like, in one sense, material nature go on giving troubles. Of course in one sense, to correct the people, to divert them from this topic, them from the sense gratificator to spirituality but there is another chance also that people may go away from spirituality also so how to understand this okay so when there is distrust the people may not the people may become averse to spiritual life more and more isn't it so actually when distress comes in a person's life some people will see where distress comes they become very spiritually inclined others when they become distressed they'll become averse both kind of people you will see those who are Punya those who are Punyatmas when distress comes in their life they become spiritually inclined and those who are those who are more sinful you know activities those who have done when distress has come in their life of where is God I don't believe in God how can all these problems and come in my life that becomes their attitude so they'll become averse and this is what happens so if a person is if a person is a Punyatma naturally he will turn towards the towards spirituality just like there was some survey in the US that normally when you know and when the whole economy was going very well everything was going nicely before 2008 and all that everything was running very well the whole world economy was booming and the US especially was doing very well so in the churches if you see on Sunday Sunday is when you know Christians all go to church so Sunday mass hardly one or two people used to be there and that too the people would come will be old people so then after 2008 or something there was a big recession and Lehman Brothers collapsed and so many things happened so at that time what happened suddenly in the churches the church has started getting filled with people and all young people started coming so the fathers in the churches became very happy good economic depression has agreed so more people are starting coming to our churches so this is an actual reality this is an actual fact why because when distress is there many people who are who are pure niatmas who'd turn towards spirituality they realize that you know we are not in good shape of life they seem to.. the state, when human beings are sad and buy what they would call money at must they all Um,六, and notice we are hurt they are really psychological, and this is when it gets bad we are fortunate that they are forgiven they are como sóン� sapuí ten in schools they crossed so people asked three조 secure you know man, because what happened is that they honor me you when we are pulled over many people theybní we are not in control of this world we think we are in control and everything goes well we think yes I'm in full control just like car when you're driving you've got a you know illusory feeling that yes I'm fully in control but when accident happen accident happens then you realize it's not in my control so it's actually is not in your control so you know so that's the reality so material world it's time and again we have seen whenever there is war whenever there is economic depression all these kind of things the number of people going to temples the number of people going to churches the number of people going to mass this goes up this goes up tremendous so that shows when there is distress people do turn turn towards God okay thank you any other

**Key Quote:** "Otherwise, he'll get burnt out."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the need for breaks and vacations in material work to illustrate the difference with spiritual activity.

Whenever somebody is engaged in some activity, that person after a little while needs a little break. Otherwise, he'll get burnt out. That's why every week when you go to office, there is a weekend. Saturday and Sunday are off. Shut off your mind from your work and relax and take out all the stress. Go out somewhere. Nowadays, people are talking that the five-day week should be reduced to a four-day or a three-day week. Every alternate day, they should have a holiday. That will increase the productivity of the people. And once in a year, some long holiday also is required. Go on vacation.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service to Krishna is never tiring because it is transcendental and provides constant satisfaction.

In the case of a devotee, what happens is, Anisham, constantly is engaged only in thinking of Krishna, speaking of Krishna, rendering service to Krishna. Nataraptaha, he never gets satiated. He feels whatever I'm doing is not enough. I want to do more. I want to do more. Even 24 hours in a day is not enough. I want more time. I want to do more. This is the characteristic of devotional service because it is not material. Anything material becomes hackneyed. You get fed up with it after a little time. But because devotional service to Krishna is completely transcendental, therefore, we never get satiated.

**Key Quote:** "Taking shelter of the Supreme Lord brings actual fearlessness and therefore the demigods decided to take shelter of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker reads and explains a verse and purport from Srimad Bhagavatam about taking shelter of the Supreme Lord to overcome fear.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 6, Chapter 9, entitled, The Appearance of the Demon, Prithrasura. Text No. 21 śrī-devā-ūchuhu vāivambharāgnya-kṣitayastriloka brahmādayo ye vayam udvijantaḥ harāmayasmai balimantakosau vibheti asmādharanam tato naḥ translation and purport by His Divine Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda The demigods said the three worlds are created by the five elements namely ether, air, fire, water and earth, which are controlled by various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahmā. Being very much afraid that the time factor will end our existence, we offer presentations unto time by performing our work as time dictates. The time factor himself, however, is afraid of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, let us now worship that Supreme Lord who alone can give us full protection. Purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda When one is afraid of being killed, one must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is worshipped by all the demigods, beginning from Brahmā. Although they are in charge of the various elements of the material world. The words vibheti asmād indicate that all the demons, regardless of how great and powerful, fear the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods, being afraid of death, took shelter of the Lord and offered Him these prayers. Although the time factor is fearful to everyone, fear personified is afraid of the Supreme Lord, who is therefore known as abhaya, fearless. Taking shelter of the Supreme Lord brings actual fearlessness and therefore the demigods decided to take shelter of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "How Mother Yasoda can put me down when I am hungry and I am drinking her milk?"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the Damodara Lila, focusing on Krishna's anger at Yasoda for leaving him to tend to the boiling milk and his subsequent mischievous act of breaking the curd pot.

When Kṛṣṇa had appeared 5000 years ago, He performed many wonderful pastimes, especially during His childhood. When Kṛṣṇa was about probably around one year old, once it so happened that Yasodamāyī was sitting in her house and she was churning the curd, nice freshly formed curd. She was churning to take out the butter, so that she could feed Kṛṣṇa with it. And Kṛṣṇa at that time, He was feeling hungry. He walked up to His mother and started pulling her, pestering her, that I am hungry, I want milk. Yasodamāyī stopped her churning, took Kṛṣṇa on her lap and started feeding Him her breast milk. And while Kṛṣṇa was drinking His mother's milk, suddenly Yasodamāyī noticed on the fireplace, she had placed one pot of milk to boil. And this milk was a special milk which was meant for feeding Kṛṣṇa. And that milk started boiling and overflowing. Yasodamāyī immediately, she thought, oh, if this milk boils over and it gets burnt, then what will my Kṛṣṇa drink? So she immediately removed Kṛṣṇa from her lap, set Him down and ran to the kitchen. To remove the milk from the fireplace. And it would have taken some time, she had to remove the milk and then put off the fire and if some milk had been spilt over, clean up and all those kind of things. Some time it took and she came back. Now in the meantime, our Kṛṣṇa is not someone who is going to wait for anyone. He got very angry. How Mother Yasoda can put me down when I am hungry and I am drinking her milk? How she can put me down and go away? So Kṛṣṇa became very angry. I will show her what I am. So He looked around and what to do? He looked at the pot of curd that Mother Yasoda had been churning. He took a stone and broke that pot. And even, you know, all small children also when they get angry, they will do something naughty like that. And after they do it, then they will start thinking, now what is going to be the consequence? You know, when we grow up, we first think of the consequence and then we act. Children are not like that. They first act and then think of the consequence. So Kṛṣṇa also broke the pot. After breaking the pot, He started thinking, okay, my anger, Bhadas nikal diya. I, you know, I showed my anger, broke the pot. Now Mother Yasoda will come. What is going to happen? So better I scoot from here. Better I don't stay here. So silently, He slipped away from there. So Yasoda Mai, after cleaning up the kitchen or whatever, she came back and she saw, Krishna is not there. Okay, Krishna must have gone. He must have gone to play or something. But then she saw that the pot of curd has been broken and the curd is all spilled over. So she thought, who can do this? Nobody can come into the house and do all this. Krishna only must have done this. She deduced. After all, she is a mother. She knows her son. Who can know her son better than her? So she thought, Oh, Krishna, you are doing like this. I will teach you a lesson today. She started searching. Where is Krishna? Where is Krishna? Where is Krishna? And searching, searching, she came to the storehouse where Krishna was sitting and he was taking out the butter and he was feeding all the monkeys. So silently, Yasoda Mai walked up behind him, wanting to catch him. But suddenly, Krishna turned and saw, Oh, Yasoda Mai is coming. He left everything and started running. Yasoda Mai also started. She was also not going to give up. Today I have to teach him one lesson. Determined. And she ran after him and Krishna is also running. Yasoda Mai is running. And you know how difficult it is to catch children. Although they are so small, if they start running, so difficult it is. Like some of our temples, we will be doing ICVK. Right? In the, for small children, even in Chennai also, we have started ICVK. Some, some small kids, in that three to five year age guru, they will not sit quietly. They will keep running around and, and the teacher, to control the child, it is very difficult. So, she ran after him and Krishna is also running. Yasoda Mai is running. And you know how difficult it is to catch children. To control the child, it will, you know, she will be totally fed up. She will not be able to do it. So, children are like that. So, Krishna is running. Yasoda Mai is trying to catch, but she is not able to capture him. And, the laborious, you know, running, running, running. She was panting and she was perspiring. But she was also not giving up. Somehow, I am going to catch Krishna today. I am not going to give up. So, Krishna also saw that his mother has become tired. She is perspiring. And, she is, you know, breathing heavily. So, Krishna allowed himself to be captured by Yasoda Mai. Yasoda Mai caught him. And then, when she caught him, she saw Krishna was crying out of fear. What is mother is going to do now? I broke the pot. So, already in fear of the punishment, he had started crying.

**Key Quote:** "So, Krishna allowed himself to be captured by Yasoda Mai."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the Damodara Lila narration, describing Yasoda catching Krishna, his crying, her decision not to beat him, and his subsequent tying to the wooden mortar, leading to the liberation of Nalakuvara and Manigreeva.

Sometimes, it happens, no? We all, as children, if you remember, when we were in classroom, something we did, show your hand and took the scale. Before the teacher lifts this one itself, we will start crying. And, teacher will say, hey, what did I do? First, you show your hand. Don't cry. So, children are like that. So, Krishna also, Yasoda Mai is going to punish me today. He started crying. And, Yasoda Mai had applied nice mascara to Krishna's eyes. All that mascara is flowing down Krishna's cheeks. And, Krishna is in great fear. And, Yasoda Mai saw that Krishna is crying so badly. It's not good that he feels so afraid. My child should not be so much afraid of me. So, she saw in her hand, there was a stick. And, seeing the stick, she saw Krishna is becoming so afraid. So, she thought, okay, let me not beat him with this stick. She threw away the stick. But then, still punishment has to be there. Otherwise, Krishna will every time do something, even bigger. So, she saw there was a wooden mortar there. And, she took some rope and tied Krishna to it. So, you are being so naughty. So, I am punishing you. So, for some time, you remain there. Let us see what you do. So, she tied him to the wooden mortar. And, Krishna was hardly about a year old. So, Yasoda Mai then tied him and then went off. And then, Krishna thought, oh, Yasoda Mai has tied me. She tied me for breaking that pot of curd. Now, I will do something even bigger. Let us see what she will do. So, he thought what to do. And, he saw in the courtyard of Nanda Maharaj, there were two tall Arjuna trees, Yamala Arjuna trees. So, Krishna started crawling. Because, you know, one year old children, they will sometimes crawl. They will sometimes walk also. It is like that. So, Krishna started crawling. And, crawling, crawling, pulling the wooden mortar which got stuck between the two trees. And, what happened? The two trees fell down. And, out of that, two dazzling, effulgent personalities came out. They were, you all know who they are, right? Who are they? Nalakuvara and Manigreeva, the sons of Kubera. So, they came out and they offered their obeisances to Krishna. They offered their prayers and they got liberated. In the meantime, the Gopas Yashoda Mai, they all came running because two huge trees falling. They made a thundering sound. So, everybody came running out. What happened? What happened? And, they saw two trees have fallen down and Krishna is between them. So, they all thought, Oh, great fortune. Narayana has protected him. Otherwise, the trees could have fallen on Krishna. What would have been his state? He would have been crushed. So, Yashoda Mai also took Krishna and then she did not she did not chastise him or anything thinking, you know, like this. This is the famous Damodara Leela pastime. In a few months, we will have the Damodara month when we will sing those prayers and Damodara Ashtakam prayers remembering this pastime.

**Key Quote:** "She always knew that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to Krishna's later life and describes Kunti's prayers to Krishna before his departure to Dwaraka, emphasizing her understanding of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Several decades later, Krishna grew up. He got married to 16,000 princesses. He had sons, grandsons, great-grandsons. He had built Dwaraka, ruling over Dwaraka with all the Yadavas. And then, the Pandavas had also grown up. They were Krishna's cousin-brothers and they had they had become very close associates of Krishna. And the Pandavas went through many tribulations and finally, the battlefield, the battle of Kurukshetra was fought and the Pandavas got back the kingdom. By this time, Krishna had already crossed the 90 years. He was more than 90 years old. So you can see, he had, he had, you know, more than nine decades had passed. And after Yudhishthira Maharaj was enthroned as the emperor, Krishna stayed for a few months in Hastinapura to please Yudhishthira and then after a few months, then Krishna said, all the residents of Dwaraka will be waiting for me, so I have to go now. So the Pandavas assembled and Satyavati also came, although she was very old, she was also there, Shantanu's wife and the, you know, Draupadi came, Kunti Maharani came, all the Pandavas, they all came, Uttara also came, they started offering their prayers to Krishna. Great anxiety, now Krishna is going to go away. At that time, Kunti Maharani offered her prayers to Krishna. Although Kunti Maharani was the paternal daughter of Krishna, so she was in a superior position to Krishna. Although she was so, she always knew that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. She did not think of Krishna like a, my nephew, no, not like that. She, she always had the understanding that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So when she heard that Krishna is going to go back to Dwaraka, she came and offered her prayers to Krishna, and Krishna was departing. And those prayers of Kunti Maharani are captured in the first canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam.

#### time factor, Krishna's control, impartiality

**Key Quote:** "The Time Factor is nothing but it is another aspect of yours."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Kunti's prayer, explaining Krishna's role as the Supreme Controller in the form of the Time Factor, highlighting the impartiality and all-encompassing control of time.

Beautiful prayers. One of the things that Kunti Maharani prayed to Krishna was, Manyetvam Kaalam Eeshanam Anadi Nidhanam Vibhum Samam Charantham Sarvatra Bhutanam Yan Mitak Kalihi. She said, because she is, you know, she is aware that she is the Supreme Controller in the form of the Time Factor. Kaalam Eeshanam. O Krishna, I know that you are Kaala, the Supreme Controller in the form of the Time Factor. Kaalam Eeshanam. So you control everybody in the form of the Time Factor. The Time Factor is nothing but it is another aspect of yours. Actually, the Time Factor it is all powerful. Nobody can withstand the force of time. So, Manyetvaam Kaalam Eeshanam Anadi Nidhanam. Anadi, Adi means beginning. Nidhanam means end or destruction. So, even in Hindi, we say when somebody dies, we say, Inka Nidhan Ho Gaya. Right? So that means Nidhanam means destruction or end. The word Adi, what it becomes Anadi. That means Adi means beginning. Anadi means without a beginning. Anadi Nidhanam means without a beginning or end. So, Krishna is that Supreme Time Factor which has neither beginning nor end. Samam Charantham Sarvatra and the Time Factor is very, very impartial. Time Factor will not see that this person, he is a small child, small baby. His Ayu, his life span has got over. But what to do, poor child, no, let him grow a little more. Time Factor will not see. Time, your time has gone up, your duration of life is over. You are a baby, you are old man, young man, girl, man, woman, child. Time Factor will not consider any of those things. Your Ayu is over, your life span is over. Time Factor is very impersonal. It will never consider, it will, it shows, does not show any mercy, no favour to anyone. So, so, Kunti Maharani said, Samam Charantham Sarvatra and all the living entities are under the control of the Time Factor. And when we see, say all living entities, it's not just limited to the Earth Planet. It's not limited to the birds and bees and all that. Even human beings are also under the control of the Time Factor. Human beings, the human civilization may develop. We may become very advanced. Science and technology may advance a lot. But no matter how much advancement we make, no matter how much scientific discoveries and inventions we make, still, we are always under the control of the Time Factor. Samam Charantham Sarvatra Bhoothaanam Yanyam Mithranam Samam Charantham Sarvatra Bhoothaanam Yanyam Mithra Kalihi So all the living entities, not only on this planet, even the Devatas are under the control of the Time Factor. Even Brahma is under the control of the Time Factor. Brahma also has a fixed lifespan. When the time comes for him to, when his lifespan gets over, after Dviparartha, two Pararthas, what happens? He has to give up his body, go on to the next body. So even Brahma, even all the Devatas, Agni, Vayu, Brahmins, Devatas, Demigods who control all the other living entities, even they are controlled by the Time Factor. Which is what the Devatas themselves are stating here. They are saying, Udvijan Taha We are afraid of the Time Factor because any moment the Time Factor may take control of us and we may die. So Kuntimharani is well aware of this. Now Kuntimharani did not stop there. He said, I am not going to stop when she glorified Krishna like this that you are the Time Factor. You are the Supreme Controller. The everybody all the Devatas everybody are afraid of you.

**Key Quote:** "Death personified fears you. And what are you doing? You are crying in fear of Yashodamai."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing Kunti's prayers, focusing on the inconceivable nature of Krishna, who is feared by death personified yet afraid of Yashoda Mai.

then she remembered see 90 years 90 years have passed by. After 90 years Kuntimharani is remembering that incident which happened when Krishna was one year old with Esodhamai in Vraja. Krishna was like a Chant in the Gopi Adade Gopi Adade Dhama Tavam Nyate Dasashru Kalilanjana Sambramaksham Vatram Niniya Bhaya Bhavana Asthithasyas Samami Bimohiti Bheerapiyat Bibheti She said Gopi Adade Dvai Krita Agasi Krita Agasi means The Gopi, Yashodamai, took a rope in her hand to tie you to the wooden mortar. At that time, What was your state? I remember your state. What was your state? There were a flood of tears flowing down your cheeks. And all the mascara was getting washed away. And this was your state. And you are in great fear of Yashodamai. And who are you? Fear personified. Fear personified. Who is fear personified? Death. And death is another form of Kala or time. So she is saying, The Kala, the time factor, is so fearful to all the Devatas. And you are the controller of that time factor. Even Kala, even death personified. Death personified fears you. And what are you doing? You are crying in fear of Yashodamai. Samam vimohayati. When I remember this, I am bewildered. How can this happen? How is this happening? So this, This is a completely inconceivable thing. A personality, Whom fear personified fears. Whom Kala, time factor, fears. Fearing whom death can happen. Whom Kala, time factor, fears. Whom Kala, time factor, fears. Death carries out its duties very impartially and very strictly. Why is death, why is Kala so impartial? Because Kala or death is very much afraid. If I don't do my duty properly, Krishna will punish me. So that death is afraid of Krishna. And that Krishna is afraid of a simple cowherd woman. Yashodamai. When I think of this, it's very, very bewildering. So it's inconceivable. How can such a great personality, Whom even death personified fears, Be afraid of a simple woman like Yashodamai? It's inconceivable.

**Key Quote:** "Actually, This shows, The, The, The, Multifaceted personality that Krishna is."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Sukadeva Goswami also highlights Krishna's inconceivable nature, emphasizing the contrast between Krishna being feared by death and being afraid of his devotee, Yashoda.

And this, This astonishment, And Krishna's becoming afraid, Of Yashodamai, Is not limited only to Kunti Maharani. Even Sukadeva Goswami, When he describes this, Pastime of the Damodara Leela, In the Srimad Bhagavatam, in the 10th canto, After describing this, He said, He said, Tam amanyata atmajam That Yashodamai, She thought Krishna is my son. Atmajam. But, Who is that Krishna? He is Avyaktam. He is that unmanifest Supreme Lord. Who is not visible to everybody. It's not that Krishna is an ordinary person. Anybody can see. No. He is such a great person. He is Avyaktam. Not everybody can see him. Only to whom Krishna reveals himself, They can see him. That is that personality. And, Adhokshajam. He is completely transcendental. But that Krishna, Yashodamai thought, This Krishna is my son. And thinking like this, What did she do? Gopikoolukhale, Damna babandha prakritam yatha. She, Damna with a rope, Ulukale babandha. She tied him to a wooden mortar. What is this? That Supreme Lord, Who is, Who is unmanifest, Who is not visible to everybody. Even the Devatas, If they want to see Krishna, They cannot see him. They have to go to the shore of, The Kshira Udaka, The milk ocean. And then they have to chant the Purusha Sukta prayers. And they please the Paramatma. Even then Paramatma also is not visible to them. He will only give instructions to Brahma in the heart. And they have to hear. And they have to follow. Om tad Vishnoha paramam padam, Sada pashyanti surayaha. Even the Devatas are waiting, When will we have darshan of the lotus feet of, Paramatma Vishnu. And that Vishnu is, One portion of the, Plenary portion of Krishna. So you can imagine, How much tougher it will be to see Krishna. And that Krishna, Yashodhama is thinking, That, This is my son. And prakritam yatha, As if Krishna is just another ordinary child, Like everybody else. Gopi kulukale damna babandashi, Took him and tied him to the wooden mat. What is this? This is completely unbelievable. So you see, Krishna's feature, On one hand, You have Krishna's feature, Of being, Fear personified, So much so that, Even fear personified fears him. So there is a, There is a facet of Krishna, Which is very frightening, To even death personified. Death frightens everyone. Right? Death terrorizes everyone. Anybody, When the point of death comes, They will all become completely afraid. So, That death who frightens everyone else, Including all the Devatas, demons, everybody, That death, Is afraid of Krishna. So Krishna has this facet, Of being very frightening. At the same time, Krishna, Has this feature, Of himself being afraid, Of his own devotees. Devotees are all completely surrendered to Krishna. They have taken shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. To those people who have taken shelter of him, To whom he is giving protection, Krishna is afraid of them. So how is this? How do you understand this? Actually, This shows, The, The, The, Multifaceted personality that Krishna is.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "God is not to be appreciated just as a very person to be feared."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the fearful aspect of God is present in many religions, but Srimad Bhagavatam reveals Krishna's multifaceted personality, going on to describe Krishna's arrival at Kamsa's wrestling match.

Actually, This facet of Krishna, Of being a very, A person whom we all have to fear, Is there in every religion. And that is why, If somebody is very religious, What do we say? He is a God-fearing person. He is afraid of God. Isn't it? That's what we say. Like the, Devatas are also stating here, Udvijantaha, We are afraid of Krishna. Especially in his, Form as Kala. So that is one facet of Krishna. And normally in all other scriptures, Religious scriptures, Only this facet of the Supreme Lord, Is shown to the people. Oh, God is very powerful. If you don't follow his rules, He will punish you. He will put you into hell. You will have to undergo so much misery. So, With great fear, Follow whatever he has told. So this fearful aspect of Krishna, Is there in every scripture. Even amongst tribal people, Aborigines, Those who are not very civilized people, Even amongst them, You can see, They will worship some lightning, Or some thunder, Or some big mountain, With great fear. So you will see, This facet of Krishna, Is there, Very commonly you will find it. But it's only in the Srimad Bhagavatam, Where Krishna is shown to have, Shown to be, A multi-faceted personality. And this fact, Sukadeva Goswami, Brings out in the tenth canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam. When Krishna, When he was about ten years and six months old, Krishna left, Vrindavan, Nandagav, And he came to Mathura, To attend that Mela, That great festival, Which had been organized by Kamsa. When Krishna came there, Kamsa had made a big plan, In the name of a Mela, He had called everybody, Invited everyone, He had called all his allies, Some friendly kings, And then he had called some yogis, Some ascetics, Some rishis, All those kind of people, And he had also invited all the, Village people, Here, Like that he sent an invitation to, Vraja also, To Nanda Maharaj, That we are organizing a big festival, All of you also come, Like that.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the inconceivable nature of Krishna and how it pervades all his characteristics, linking it to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's philosophy of simultaneous oneness and difference.

And, Swapitroho Shishu, Nanda, Who was sitting there, He is, Krishna's, Father, When he saw, He is my son, My dear son, And, Above all of them, In a separate stage, Well protected, By all the, Bodyguards, Who were sitting, Kamsa was sitting, Kamsa also saw, Krishna, Entering the stadium, How did, Kamsa see, Mrityur, Bhojapatir, Bhojapati, The king of the Bhojas, Which is, Kamsa, When he saw, Oh, He was perspiring, Sweating, His heart, Started thudding, My death has come, For him, He did not see, Krishna, And, Then, What happened, There were others, All the Rishis and Sages, How did they see him, Tattvamparam, Yoginam, All the Yogis saw, This is the, Supreme, Absolute truth, Who is stepping into the stadium, That is how, They saw him, And, Vrishnina, Paradevateti, Viditho, Rangamandale, So, Sagrajaha, Along with his, Elder brother, Krishna, Entered the Rangamandala, Like this, They saw Krishna, They saw, He is the best, Descendant of our dynasty, He, In our dynasty, There have been, So many great people, He is the best person, Of all, This is how, They saw him, So, You see, One Krishna, When he is entering the arena, How different people, Are seeing Krishna, Differently, Like this, Multi-faceted, Personality, So, God is not to be, Appreciated, Just as, A very, Person, To be feared, Krishna, Appears, To be a, Fearful, Personality, To those, Who are, Who do not, Know him, Intimately, Who are not, His devotees, And to those, Who are inimical, Towards him, But if you become, His devotee, Then, You become, Very, Very dear, To him, So, This is the, Inconceivable, Feature of Krishna, Krishna is smiling, And entering, The arena, The heart, Of the wrestlers, And Kamsa, You see, How this is, So, Inconceivable, Actually, This, Inconceivable, Nature, Of Krishna, Pervades, All his, Characteristics, And attributes, All features, Of Krishna, Is pervaded, By this, Inconceivableness, And that is, Why, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu, Built, The whole, Philosophy, Siddhanta, Sattva, The Veda, And Abheda, Simultaneously, We are one with, And different, From Krishna, And this is, Achintya, Inconceivable, Unless, We accept this, Inconceivable, Characteristic, Of Krishna, We cannot, Understand him, Fully, We cannot, Understand, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu's, Philosophy,

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So this demonstrates the inconceivable nature of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Ganga originating from Krishna's lotus feet to illustrate Krishna's inconceivable nature, emphasizing the importance of studying Srimad Bhagavatam and appreciating Srila Prabhupada's mercy in revealing these truths.

Actually, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu, Gave a, Very beautiful, Example, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu, Gives, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu, Says, Ambujam, Ambuni, Jatam, Ambujam, Means, The Lotus, The Lotus, Is, Born, Within, The Water, Ambuni, Within, The Water, Jatam, The Lotus, Is, The Lotus, Is, Born, Within, The Water, The Water, Is, The Lotus, Is, Born, Within, The Water, Is, The Lotus, Is, The Lotus, Is, The Lotus, Is, Born, Within, The Water, Is, The Lotus, Is, The Lotus, Is, orbited, Move, From, The Whereabouts, Of, The, Lotus, From the lotus feet of Krishna, a great river has come out. Ganga has come out from the lotus feet of Krishna. See, from a lotus, water has come out. Not water, a big river has come out. You see how inconceivable this is. Water can never come from a lotus. Lotus always comes from water. But in the case of Krishna, it is the reverse. Water comes from his lotus feet. So this demonstrates the inconceivable nature of Krishna. So therefore, as devotees of Krishna, we can appreciate the multifaceted aspects of Krishna, his character. Not only his feature of being fear personified, being fearful to fear personified, but being... so sweet that he becomes afraid of his own devotee. So this is... when we understand this feature of Krishna, we can understand the Absolute Truth in full. That is why only by Bhakti, pure devotional service, we can understand the Supreme Absolute Truth in completeness. So the Devatas, they are also devotees, but they are Sakama Bhaktas. They are not Ananya Bhaktas. And so therefore, for them, Krishna is somebody whom we have to bow down to, whom we have to be always afraid of, whom even fear personified fears. This is how they appreciate. But when Bhagavatam reveals, that is not the only feature of Krishna. If you have to understand Krishna in fullness, you have to understand Esodhamai, and how Krishna is afraid. That Krishna whom even fear personified fears, is afraid of Esodhamai, his own devotee. So this is the full understanding. So this is the full understanding of Krishna. understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth which is revealed in the pages of the Srimad Bhagavatam and further revealed to us by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and so mercifully revealed to all of us by Srila Prabhupada without his, without Prabhupada's books, without Prabhupada's teachings, where we could have understood all these things? Why Krishna is afraid of Yashoda Mai and why all these different people are seeing Krishna differently? We would never have been able to understand all this. The inconceivable nature of Krishna, we would never have been able to grasp it and all this is possible simply because of our beloved spiritual master Srila Prabhupada's compassion. Because of his mercy, we are able to understand this and so therefore, we should study the Srimad Bhagavatam very seriously and that will give us access to the sweet feature of Krishna. Krishna, which is otherwise inaccessible to everybody. So I will stop here.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "However, Lord Ramachandra continues to rule the hearts of people even after millions of years. Why? Because he is not an ordinary man. He is God."
**Summary:** This segment establishes Lord Ramachandra's enduring glory and asserts his divine status based on Vedic declarations, specifically referencing the Srimad Bhagavatam.

Although Lord Ramachandra appeared such a long, long time ago, still his glories are spread everywhere. The activities of the greatest of the human beings, be they emperors or world conquerors or big, big philosophers, are forgotten after a few hundred years. During his time, Alexander must have been world famous, but today we know very little of him. In a few more decades, he may even be forgotten from the minds of the people. However, Lord Ramachandra continues to rule the hearts of people even after millions of years. Why? Because he is not an ordinary man. He is God. How do we claim that Lord Ramachandra is God and not an ordinary man? We do not claim that Lord Ramachandra is God and not an ordinary person? The basis for determining who is God or who is an incarnation of God and who is not, is not just on the basis of popularity. The basis are the Vedas. The Vedas must declare that this person is Bhagavan or God. In the first canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a description of the different incarnations or avatara of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One of them is mentioned as below: Naradevatvam Aapan Naha Surakarya Chikirsaya Samudra Nigraha Dini Chakrae Veeryaaniyata Param. In the 18th incarnation, this is what this verse of the Bhagavatam is saying. In the 18th incarnation, the Supreme Lord appeared as King Rama. In order to perform some pleasing work for the demigods, for the devatas, he exhibited superhuman powers by controlling the Indian Ocean and then killing the Atheist King Ravana who was on the other side of the sea. This is what the Srimad Bhagavatam says. So,

**Key Quote:** "We can see here clearly that Lord Rama is declared to be the incarnation of the supreme personality of God and unequivocally in the Srimad Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** This segment reinforces Lord Ramachandra's status as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, citing verses from the Srimad Bhagavatam, Padma Purana, and Vishnu Dharmottara.

Bhagavatam is saying Lord Ramachandra is an incarnation, avatara. Again in the 9th canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam it is mentioned, "Being prayed for by the devatas, by the demigods, the supreme personality of God and the absolute truth himself, directly appeared with his expansion, and expansions of the expansion. Their holy names were Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna. These celebrated incarnations thus appeared in four forms as the sons of Maharaj Dasaratha." This is what the Srimad Bhagavatam, the 9th canto says. We can see here clearly that Lord Rama is declared to be the incarnation of the supreme personality of God and unequivocally in the Srimad Bhagavatam. The Padma Purana declares that Lord Ramachandra is Narayana himself, while the Vishnu Dharmotara declares that Lord Ramachandra is an incarnation of Narayana. So Lord Ramachandra is not an ordinary person.

**Key Quote:** "Thus in multiple places, apart from the Ramayana, Lord Rama has been declared to be an incarnation of the supreme personality of Godhead in the Vedas. And hence we accept him as such."
**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing the widespread Vedic support for Lord Ramachandra being an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, referencing the Brahma Samhita and reiterating the acceptance of this truth based on Vedic authority.

But he is an expansion or incarnation, the avatara of the supreme personality of Godhead. In various parts, apart from the Ramayana, we can see how Lord Ramachandra is declared to be the supreme Lord himself. The Brahma Samhita also states, "I worship the supreme personality of Godhead, Govinda, Krishna, who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rama, Narasimha and many sub-incarnations as well, but who is the original personality of Godhead, known as Krishna, and who incarnates personally also." So even the Brahma Samhita also declares that Lord Ramachandra is an incarnation. Thus in multiple places, apart from the Ramayana, Lord Rama has been declared to be an incarnation of the supreme personality of Godhead in the Vedas.

**Key Quote:** "What this mantra essentially does is, to locate the space and time of the event."
**Summary:** This segment explains how the Sankalpa Mantra locates our position in the universe and in time, focusing on the concept of Samvatsaras and their cycle.

What this mantra essentially does is to locate the space and time of the event. When we say Jambudvipa, Bharatavarsha, Bharatakhanda, Merohodakshinaparshva, what is happening? It is locating our current position within the universe. And as far as time is concerned, this is how we are located. We are right now in the Shubhakrit Samvatsara. What does this mean? In Vedic astrology, the Samvatsaras are years which are calculated in terms of the time Brihaspati or Jupiter takes to traverse the 12 Rasis. This comes to about 360 days to traverse one Rasi. One cycle of Brihaspati to cover all the 12 Rasis comes to 12 Samvatsaras. One Chakra or cycle of Samvatsaras is 5 cycles or 60 Samvatsaras. Each of these 60 Samvatsaras is given a particular name. And the first Samvatsara is called Prabhava. We are currently in the 36th Samvatsara by the name Shubhakrit. Hence, in the Sankalpa Mantra, we say Prabhavadi Shashti Samvatsarana Madhe Shubhakrit Nama Samvatsare. Shashti means 60. Samvatsarana Madhe means in the middle of the 60 Samvatsaras. Prabhavadi means beginning with the Samvatsara named Prabhava. Shubhakrit Nama Samvatsare means in the Samvatsara by the name Shubhakrit. The 36th Samvatsara in the middle of the 60 Samvatsara cycle is called Shubhakrit.

That is, we are in the Prathamapada or first quarter of Kali Yuga. Which Kali Yuga? The Ashtavimshatitame Kali Yuge in the 28th Kali Yuga. The Kali Yuga is one of the four Yugas which constitute a Mahayuga. The Mahayuga is the cycle of the Satya Yuga, Dwapara Yuga, Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga. Out of that, we have right now passed a little more than 5100 years. One Mahayuga constitutes a cycle of Satya Yuga, Dwapara Yuga, Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga. After the present Kali Yuga ends, which will take about another 427000 years, once again Satya Yuga will start, and the Yugas will go on in the same cycle. So, we are now in the 28th Kali Yuga. One Mahayuga or a cycle of Satya, Dwapara, Treta and Kali Yugas lasts for 43.2 lakhs or 4.32 million years. There are 71 such Mahayugas in the lifespan of one Manu. Now we are in Vaivasvata Manvantara, we are in the Manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu. So, we are in the 28th Mahayuga or the 28th Kali Yuga out of 71 Mahayugas of Vaivasvata Manu. And Vaivasvata Manu is the 7th out of the 14 Manus in a day of Brahma. That means it is right now mid-day for Lord Brahma because we are in the 7th Manu out of 14 Manus. In one day of Brahma, there are 14 Manus or 1000 Mahayugas or 4.32 billion years. And similar is Brahma's night. So, 24 hours of Brahma's night is actually, for us, 8.64 billion years.

**Key Quote:** "And one Pararth of Brahma is 50 such years which comes to 155.5 trillion years and Brahma lives for 2 such Pararth's which comes to a total of 311 trillion years."
**Summary:** This segment continues the explanation of the Vedic time scale, discussing Pararthas and relating it to the appearance of Lord Krishna and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu within that timeline.

360 such days constitute one year of Brahma or it comes to 3.11 trillion years. And one Pararth of Brahma is 50 such years which comes to 155.5 trillion years and Brahma lives for 2 such Pararth's which comes to a total of 311 trillion years. Where are we right now on that time scale? Adya Brahmanah Dvitiya Parardhe meaning we are right now in the second Parardha of Lord Brahma and in that we are in Shwetavaraha Kalpe. We are in the Shwetavaraha Kalpa or Shwetavaraha Day of Brahma. Shwetavaraha Day is the first day of Brahma of the Parardha. That means we are in the first day of the 51st year of Brahma and so we can all say happy birthday to Lord Brahma. And in that we are at midday of Brahma. It is about noon time for Brahma now in the 7th Manu within which we are in the 28th Mahayuga of the 7th Manu which is Vaivasvata Manu. Lord Krishna appeared in this 28th Mahayuga, in the same Mahayuga where we are all currently in. Lord Krishna appears only once in a day of Lord Brahma and in the Mahayuga where Lord Krishna appears a unique thing happens. The Dwapara Yuga comes after Treta Yuga. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu also appears in the Kali Yuga in the same Mahayuga where Krishna appears in a day of Brahma.

#### Appearance of Rama, Scriptural Authority, Vedic Time Scale

**Key Quote:** "We should not go by hearsay, but we should go by what the Acharyas and the Shastras, the Vedic scriptures have stated."
**Summary:** The lecture addresses misconceptions about when Lord Rama appeared and clarifies the correct time based on scriptures and the teachings of Srila Rupakaswami, concluding with the statement that Lord Rama appeared 17.28 million years ago.

That means Chaitanya Mahaprabhu also appears only once in a day of Brahma. So in this mega time scale of the Universe when does Lord Ramachandra appear? You would all have heard many things from many sources. Some people say Lord Rama appears in the 7th Mahayuga. It is not true. The Lord Ramachandra appears in the 7th Mahayuga. It is not the same. The Lord Rama appeared 6,000 years ago, or 7,000 years ago, some say 20 or 30,000 years ago, and so on. We should not go by hearsay, but we should go by what the Acharyas and the Shastras, the Vedic scriptures have stated. Srila Rupakaswami, in the Lagubhagavata Amrita, he mentions like this, Kausalyaayaam Dasarathaan, Navadurva Jaladyutihi, Tretaayaam Aavirbhavat, Chaturvimshe Chaturyuge, Bharatena Sumitraya, Nandana Abhyamcha Samyutaha. Srila Rupakaswami is actually describing the appearance of Lord Ramachandra. He says, Chaturvimshe Chaturyuge Tretaayaam, meaning in the Tretaayuga of the 24th Mahabharata, Lord Ramachandra appears as the son of Dasaratha and Kausalya, along with Bharatha and the two sons of Sumitra, who are Lakshmana and Shatrughna. In other words, Lord Ramachandra appeared four Mahayugas before our current Mahayuga, where we are all right now. That means Lord Ramachandra appeared about 172.8 lakh years, or 17.28 million years, ago.

### WAS RTVIK SYSTEM TEMPORARY? | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

#### Ritvik system, July 9th directive, ISKCON law, Deeksha

**Key Quote:** "What we need to understand is that the July 9th directive of Srila Prabhupada, It's an order, not a doctrine."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of the Ritvik system and the July 9th directive, contrasting it with the GBC's stance and ISKCON law, emphasizing that the directive is an order, not a doctrine.

Hare Krishna! Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki Jai! Srila Prabhupada very carefully formulated a system of initiations via Ritviks in his time to ensure that the movement and the parampara continue smoothly even after his disappearance from this world. And Srila Prabhupada did this through the July 9th, 1977 directive. This July 9th, 1977 directive is one of the most important directions for the institution of ISKCON because in Gaudiya Vaishnava Siddhanta, Deeksha is the foremost step in a devotee's spiritual life which eternally binds the devotee to his spiritual master and sets him on the path home, back home, back to Godhead. The ISKCON Mumbai Group's GBC has chosen to disobey this direct order of Srila Prabhupada in the matter of initiations or Deeksha. Not only has the GBC decided to disobey Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order, they have also decided that in ISKCON, nobody else should be allowed to follow this order of Srila Prabhupada. And so, they have formulated ISKCON law 6.4.7.2 which states the doctrine of ISKCON, doctrine that Srila Prabhupada desired to continue to act as Deeksha Guru after his departure from this world and did not desire any of his disciples to give Deeksha in succession after him is a dangerous philosophical deviation. Ritvikism directly goes against the principle of parampara itself of successive Deeksha and Sikhsha Gurus which sustains the pure teachings and practices of Krishna consciousness. This principle has been established by Krishna and is upheld by all Vaishnava Acharyas. Indeed, it is accepted by all followers of Vedic culture. Ritvikism is thus an extreme deviation. It is utterly erroneous to espouse it, deluding and misguiding to teach it and blasphemous to attribute it to Srila Prabhupada. No one who espouses, teaches, or practices Ritvikism can be a member in good standing of ISKCON. So, in this ISKCON law, according to the GBC, Ritvikism is a doctrine that Srila Prabhupada desired to continue to act as Deeksha Guru in succession after him and it is a dangerous philosophical deviation.

#### Order vs. Doctrine, Chanting 16 rounds, Principle vs. Application

**Key Quote:** "To chant 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra is not any doctrine."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of chanting 16 rounds to differentiate between an order and a doctrine, explaining that chanting a fixed number of times is a principle, while the specific number is an application determined by the Acharya.

What we need to understand is that the July 9th directive of Srila Prabhupada, it's an order, not a doctrine. To understand the difference between order and doctrine, let me give you a simple example. Suppose I ask you, how many rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra do you chant daily? You will respond that you chant 16 rounds. Now, if I ask you, why 16 rounds? Why are you chanting 16 rounds? You will answer, because Srila Prabhupada ordered all devotees in ISKCON to chant 16 rounds. That's why. Now, suppose I respond that, oh, so you espouse the doctrine of 16-roundism, which is a doctrine that Srila Prabhupada desired that every devotee in ISKCON should continue to chant 16 rounds after his departure and it is a dangerous philosophical deviation. Does it make any sense? Obviously, not. Why? Because to chant 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra is not any doctrine. You won't find any mention of such a thing in any Shastra. Nowhere in Shastra will you find it prescribed that you have to chant 16 rounds. You won't find any precedence of it in our Sampradaya or any other Sampradaya. The fact is that to chant a fixed number of times daily as per a vow is the principle. Sankhya Purvaka Nama. Nama, to chant the holy name a fixed number of times daily is the principle. Now, how many rounds to chant? That is left to the Acharya to determine

#### Sankhya Purvaka Nama, Vow, Love for Krishna

**Key Quote:** "By chanting Krishna's holy name, a fixed number of times daily as a vow, one will develop love for Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the principle of chanting a fixed number of times as a vow (Sankhya Purvaka Nama) from the Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing its importance in developing love for Krishna.

based on various considerations like time, place, circumstance, etc. Hence, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur ordered to chant 64 rounds in Gaudiya Matha and Srila Prabhupada ordered to chant 16 rounds in ISKCON. Whether 64 or 16 rounds, both don't have any precedence or Shastric reference. That is because the principle only is there in the Shastra. And what is the principle? One must chant as per a vrata or vow. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 11, Chapter 2, Verse number 40, it is said, Evam vratah svapriya nama kirtiya. Evam vratah svapriya nama kirtiya. By chanting Krishna's holy name, a fixed number, a fixed number of times daily as a vow, one will develop love for Krishna. That is the principle. Now, when applying this principle, Srila Prabhupada has decided that the number of times should be 16 rounds.

#### Deeksha, Spiritual Master, Bhajana Kriya, July 9th order
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/B2AxofMdAyU?t=335
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada has given the application, the application of the principle in his July 9th order."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the principle of taking Deeksha from a spiritual master and how Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order is an application of this principle, not a doctrine, and therefore the GBC is wrong to call it a doctrine.

Similarly, the principle as per Shastra is Adau Guruva Shayam. One's spiritual life begins when one takes Deeksha or initiation from the spiritual master. Adau Shraddha Tata Sadhu Sangha Tato Bhajana Kriya. This is the famous verse from the Nectar of Devotion, Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu. So, at the Bhajana Kriya stage, one decides to take formal Deeksha. In the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalira, Chapter 23, Verses 14 and 15, give this Adau Shraddha verse. And it states, Srila Prabhupada, in the synonyms, word-to-word synonyms of the Bhajana Kriya verse, he mentions the Bhajana Kriya, he has translated it as, Performance of Devotion. He is giving formal service to Krishna, surrendering to the spiritual master and being encouraged by the association of devotees, so that initiation takes place. In the translation to these verses also, Srila Prabhupada in the Chaitanya Charitamrita says, In the beginning, there must be faith. That is Adau Shraddha. Then one becomes interested in associating with pure devotees. This is Sadhu Sangha. Thereafter, one is initiated by the spiritual master and executes the regulative principles under his order. This is Sadhu Sangha. So, it is clear that the principle is that one must take Deeksha from a spiritual master to progress in devotional life to the next stage of Anarthanivritti and then further on till one reaches the stage of Krishna Prema. That is the principle. Now, how to get the formal Deeksha? That is an application of the principle that one must take Deeksha at the stage of Bhajana Kriya from a pure devotee. And Srila Prabhupada has given the application, the application of the principle in his July 9th order. So, therefore, it is not necessary that we will find either chanting 16 rounds or 64 rounds or the Rithvik system of initiations in Shastra. So, the GBC calling the Rithvik system of initiations as a doctrine is wrong, just like saying 16 roundism is a doctrine. So, like that, Rithvikism is a doctrine is also wrong. The Rithvik system of initiations is an offence. The Rithvik system of initiations is an offence. Therefore, it is an order of Srila Prabhupada as to how initiations will be conducted in ISKCON,

#### Authenticity of July 9th order, Vani vs. Vapu, Srila Prabhupada's Potency

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The July 9th directive gets its authority because of Srila Prabhupada's vani, his order."
**Summary:** The speaker presents Amayatma Prabhu's argument that the July 9th order's authenticity comes from Srila Prabhupada's vani (order), not his vapu (physical presence), and therefore remains valid even after his disappearance.

particularly after his disappearance. Another flaw in this ISKCON law which is brought up by His Grace Amayatma Prabhu is worth considering. So, I will put Amayatma Prabhu's argument in my own words. As per the GBC, Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order appointing Rithviks was only temporary to be followed until Srila Prabhupada was physically present. That means that the GBC accepts that at least between July 9th, 1977, if not earlier, and till November 14th, 1977, the Rithvik system of initiations was valid and that the July 9th order was authentic and potent, at least for that period during Srila Prabhupada's physical presence. That raises the question, as to what forms the basis, what is the foundation of authenticity or what lends power to the July 9th order? Does the July 9th order get its authority or authenticity or potency from Srila Prabhupada's vapu or his vani? Is the July 9th order getting its power from Srila Prabhupada's body? You don't need to be an Einstein to get the answer right, the July 9th directive gets its authority because of Srila Prabhupada's vani, his order. It is his order. Therefore, it has authenticity and potency. Now, if the July 9th directive is getting its power and potency because of Srila Prabhupada's order, not his body, then Srila Prabhupada's physical presence or absence should not make any difference. Why? Because his body doesn't need any place and potency. Srila Prabhupada carries the same potency, authority and authenticity even after death.

#### Dangerous Philosophical Deviation, Validity of July 9th order, Ritvik System

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Isn't that very law actually a dangerous philosophical deviation?"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by arguing that the ISKCON law banning the Ritvik system is a dangerous philosophical deviation because it ties Srila Prabhupada's orders to his physical presence, and urges listeners to follow the July 9th order.

Just like, for example, the practice of chanting 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra daily has the same potency to deliver the conditioned souls and take them back to Godhead. It has the same potency during Srila Prabhupada's physical presence and even in his absence. What I mean by this is- Srila Prabhupada told everyone to chant 16 malas. And so, this rule is temporary and is potent or valid only till the time of his physical presence. And after Prabhupada's disappearance, chanting 16 rounds is no more valid. It is a dangerous philosophical deviation. We have to ban it. And to chant 16 rounds in ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance has to be banned. Anybody chanting 16 rounds in ISKCON after Prabhupada's disappearance, cannot be allowed to be part of ISKCON. Can we say that? Obviously, to make such a statement would be insane. In the same way, since the July 9th directive is Srila Prabhupada's order, it has the same authority, authenticity and potency even today in his physical absence, as much as it had during his physical presence before November 14, 1977. So, to say that the July 9th order, instituting Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON cannot be followed after November 14, 1977, simply because of one reason that Srila Prabhupada's body is not there, he is not physically present, is that not actually the philosophical deviation? The ISKCON law which bans Ritvik system of Diksha saying that it is a dangerous philosophical deviation, isn't that very law actually a dangerous philosophical deviation? Isn't the GBC's idea to tie Srila Prabhupada's order or his vani to his physical presence by coining a new term called posthumous Ritvik initiation? Isn't that a dangerous philosophical deviation? Isn't the GBC's assertion that Srila Prabhupada's orders must be tied to his body and once he disappears, his orders are no longer valid? Isn't that a dangerous philosophical deviation? Srila Prabhupada's order is to follow his vani. So if you want to stay safe and steer away from those dangerous philosophical deviations, please follow Srila Prabhupada's July 9th 1977 order to institute the Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON with Srila Prabhupada as the sole Diksha Guru in ISKCON.

Hare Krishna, Vishwaguru, Srila Prabhupada ki jai. Srila Prabhupada started ISKCON in 1966 by formally registering it as a legal entity in New York, United States. As Srila Prabhupada expanded ISKCON over the next four years, opening 34 branches in that short span of time by the year 1970, Srila Prabhupada decided to adopt his Guru Maharaj, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj's vision of running the organization through a GBC body even after his disappearance.

**Summary:** This segment discusses Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj's instructions regarding the management of the Gaudiya Mutt and the role of the GBC.

Srila Prabhupada wrote about this in his letter to Rupanuga dated 28th of April 1974 thus, "In the latter days of my Guru Maharaj, he was very disturbed. Actually, he left this world earlier. Otherwise, he would have continued to live for more years. Still, he requested his disciples to form a strong governing body for preaching the cult of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He never recommended anyone to be the Acharya of the Gaudiya Mutt. But Sridhar Maharaj is responsible for disobeying this order of Guru Maharaj and he and two others who are already dead unnecessarily thought that there must be one Acharya. If Guru Maharaj could have seen someone who was qualified at that time to be Acharya, he would have mentioned. Because on the night before he passed away, he talked of so many things but never mentioned an Acharya. His idea was, Acharya was not to be nominated amongst the governing body. He said openly, you make a GBC and conduct the mission. So, his idea was, amongst the members of the GBC, who would come out successful, a self-effulgent Acharya would be automatically selected."

**Summary:** This segment highlights the unauthorized selection of Acharyas in Gaudiya Mutt and warns against repeating the same mistake in ISKCON.

So, Srila Prabhupada. Sridhar Maharaj and his two associate gentlemen unauthorisedly selected one Acharya and later it proved to be a failure. The result is, now everyone is claiming to be Acharya even though they may be Kanishad Adhikari with no ability to preach. In some of the camps, the Acharya is being changed three times in a year. Therefore, we may not commit the same mistake in our Iskand camp. Actually, amongst my godbrothers, no one is qualified to become Acharya. So, you see, Shailaprabhupada warned in this letter in 1974 that the same mistake in Gaudiya Mutt should not be committed in ISKCON. What is that mistake? The mistake of not managing the organization by a GBC body, but running after position of Acharya after his disappearance.

**Key Quote:** "In ISKCON, what happened? Eleven people assumed the position of Acharya."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the deviation in ISKCON with eleven people assuming the position of Acharya and the necessity of the GBC body.

And unfortunately, that same mistake was repeated. What happened? In Gaudiya Mutt, two people assumed the role of Acharya, the position of Acharya. In ISKCON, what happened? Eleven people assumed the position of Acharya. And Shailaprabhupada says that was a failure. Those two people becoming Acharya was a failure in Gaudiya Mutt. And as a result, what is happening? Today, everybody is claiming to be an Acharya. And look at ISKCON, eleven people became Acharyas. It was a failure. Today, everybody is becoming a Guru, Diksha Guru, Acharya. Therefore, we have to understand that in all probability, Shailaprabhupada, when he made this warning in 1974, he wanted to avoid ISKCON repeating the history of Gaudiya Mutt. And what is the mistake? Ambitious devotees vying to become Acharyas and Diksha Gurus after his disappearance. To avoid this, in most probability, Shailaprabhupada decided to form the GBC, even after his disappearance. Even when he was present on this planet in 1970, when the Acharya is present on the planet, what is the need for a GBC body? There is no need, because the Acharya is directly guiding the management. That is why Shailabhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur did not form the GBC during his manifest Leela.

**Summary:** This segment explains Srila Prabhupada's vision behind forming the GBC and training his disciples to manage the institution.

He instructed his disciples to form the GBC after his disappearance. But they did not do it. Hence, Shailaprabhupada probably not wanting to take the risk of losing the GBC body, GBC in his manifest presence, run it in his presence and train his disciples how to operate the GBC while he was still physically present. Otherwise, when Srila Prabhupada was present physically, there was no need for a GBC. But if the GBC was set up and trained by Srila Prabhupada personally during his time, it would naturally go on smoothly even after his disappearance. The transition of administrative power and responsibilities would be smoother. Their acceptability amongst the devotees would not be an issue because Srila Prabhupada in his presence, if he runs the GBC as the ultimate managing authority, then after his time also, devotees would have got used to it. The acceptability of the GBC would not have been an issue at all. So with this vision, probably, Srila Prabhupada formed the GBC

**Summary:** This segment discusses Srila Prabhupada's reasons for establishing the GBC, citing his age and the need for disciples to manage the institution.

on 28th of July 1970 via the direction of management or DOM in short. In the DOM, Srila Prabhupada begins by saying, "As we have increased our volume of activities, now, I think a governing body commission- hereinafter referred to as the GBC- should be established." Now comes the important part. "I am getting old, 75 years old. Therefore, at any time, I may be out of the scene. Therefore, I think it is necessary to give instruction to my disciples how they shall manage the institution." So, you see, Srila Prabhupada is saying here that he wants to instruct his disciples when necessary. So, the GBC, connect the two roupas. So, Srila Prabhupada is saying here that he wants to instruct his disciples if it is necessary I think that he wants the disciple how they should manage the institution after Prabhupada's disappearance. That's why he formed the GBC. They are already managing individual centers represented by one president, one secretary, and one treasurer. And in my opinion, they are doing nice. But we want still more improvement in the standard of temple management, propaganda for Krishna consciousness, distribution of books and literatures, opening of new centers, and educating devotees to the right standard. Therefore, I have decided to adopt the following principles and I hope my beloved disciples will kindly accept them. So, we can see what was running in Srila Prabhupada's mind in 1970. ISKCON had already grown to 34 centers. They had their temple president, secretary, etc. And in Srila Prabhupada's own words, they were doing nice. Then what was the need for a GBC?

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the purpose of the GBC to manage ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance and prevent power struggles.

The primary reason, as Srila Prabhupada said at that time was, "I am getting old, 75 years old. Therefore, at any time, I may be out of the scene. Therefore, I think it is necessary to give instruction to my disciples how they shall manage the whole institution." That means the GBC was meant to manage ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance. By forming the GBC before his disappearance, Srila Prabhupada ensured that the authority of the GBC would be accepted by all his disciples and no one would question its authority after his disappearance. By giving managing power in the hands of the GBC in his physical presence, he preempted any ugly power struggle or dissension upon his disappearance. That would also mitigate the risk of ambitious disappearance. The GBC may have been an ideal for many disciples, artificially declaring themselves as diksha gurus and acharyas unauthorisedly after Srila Prabhupada's

disappearance, leading to the splitting of the movement like Gaudiya Mathu. But unfortunately, big gradually, one would say that after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance, despite Srila Prabhupada's explicit warning in his 1974 letter to not repeat the mistake of Gaudiya Mathu, the ambitious devotees in ISKCON did exactly that. They declared themselves as Diksha Gurus in March 1978. Maybe, probably because Shaila Prabhupada had set up the GBC and run it for 7 straight years, the authority of the GBC was ingrained in the minds of all the rank and file devotees. And so, therefore, the 11 Diksha Gurus could not dismantle the GBC. And that's why probably unlike the Gaudiamant which split into many, many factions after Shaila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's disappearance with no GBC to keep it together. Unlike that, ISKCON did not split up. Although, instead of 2 in Gaudiamant, in ISKCON, there were 11 Acharyas and still the ISKCON did not go on to split up because the GBC was there. So, you see Prabhupada's system of the GBC worked to some extent in ISKCON. But unfortunately, it did not preempt the ambitious Diksha Gurus. Devotees from declaring themselves as Diksha Gurus. And

**Summary:** This segment reveals the GBC's false claim about Srila Prabhupada selecting the 11 Diksha Gurus and emphasizes that the GBC is responsible for the deviations.

worse, what happened? They lied to all the Vaishnavas that they were appointed as Diksha Gurus by Shaila Prabhupada. In resolution number 16 of March 1978, in the GBC meetings, they said, "However, for 1978, no new spiritual masters shall be appointed other than the 11 selected by Shaila Prabhupada." So, they said the 11 were selected by Prabhupada. This they said in 1978. Later in 1999, the GBC in the resolution number 403 accepted that they had lied when they resolved in resolution 403. Unfortunately, shortly after Shaila Prabhupada's disappearance, the GBC allowed for an unauthorized zonal Acharya system to evolve in ISKCON, elevating 11 exclusive successor Diksha Gurus. So, here the GBC is saying the GBC allowed an unauthorized 11 successor Diksha Gurus to evolve into ISKCON. So, here the GBC is saying the GBC allowed an unauthorized 11 Diksha Guru to evolve, to develop, to come out. So, it was the GBC who did that, not Srila Prabhupada. No one can fault Srila Prabhupada for the GBC's deviation or the unfortunate events that unfolded after his disappearance

and continue to unfold even today in ISKCON. Srila Prabhupada tried to prevent this by forming the GBC in his presence and training them up for seven years. He also instituted the Ritvik system in ISKCON from 1970 for seven years and ran it for seven years and then handed over the Ritvik system and the GBC to ISKCON. All that the GBC had to do was continue the Ritvik system as it is as Srila Prabhupada mentioned in the July 9th order. But what happened? Even after all this despite Srila Prabhupada doing all this, they still deviated on mass in 1978. Not only that, the deviations continued in the subsequent years. Not only did they change the method of Ritvik initiations implemented by Srila Prabhupada, they also changed the method of offering Aarati. They changed the method of offering Bhoga. They changed Srila Prabhupada's books. They changed the meaning of Parampara and so on. Why did this happen? And why does the GBC continue to deviate like this? Although many of the GBCs were good devotees, how could all of them collectively deviate so badly? Well, to get some idea of why this could happen, let us look at the performance of the GBC after Srila Prabhupada formed it in the year 1970. How did they perform in governing the institution between 1970 and 1977? Because that is what the GBC is supposed to do,

govern ISKCON. Let us hear from Srila Prabhupada himself about their performance in governing ISKCON between 1970 and 1977. On 14 August 1971, barely a year after Srila Prabhupada formed the GBC, this was Prabhupada's assessment of the GBC which he mentioned in this letter to Tamalkrishna. "I set up the GBC with hope that I shall get relief from administration of the mission, but on the contrary, I have become the center of receiving so many complaints. So, it is not a relief for me. Rather, it is becoming a little troublesome." So, you see, not a very flattering assessment of the GBC's performance. But then they were just one year old. So, we can forgive them for their shortcomings. Maybe with time, they could do better. But look at what happened in 1972. The next year, on 8th of April 1972, Srila Prabhupada sent this memo to all the ISKCON temple presidents. "Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you that recently, some of the governing body commission members held a meeting at New York on 25th

through 28th March 1972. And they have sent me a big, big minutes, duplicated, for my consideration and approval. But in the meantime, they have decided some appointments without consulting me. One of the items which struck me very much is as follows. Open quotes, "Atre Rishi Das was selected to be the secretary for GBC and receive all correspondence including monthly reports." Close quotes. I never appointed Atre Rishi member of the GBC and I do not know how he can be appointed secretary to GBC without my sanction. Once again, open quotes, "he was also appointed to be on the management committee with Karandhara for the purpose of supervising ISKCON business and implementing the decisions reached by the GBC." Close quotes. This has very much disturbed me. Sriman Atre Rishi Das may be very expert. But without my say, he has been given so much power and this has upset my brain. I also understand that immediate actions are going to take place even prior to my permission and that also without divulging to the devotees. I do not follow exactly what is the motive of the so-called GBC meeting. Therefore, I have sent the telegram which you will find attached herewith and I have received the replies as well. Under the circumstances, I authorise you to disregard for the time being any decision from the GBC men until my further instruction. So you see, in 1972, Srila Prabhupada had to suspend the entire GBC and instruct all the temple presidents not to take any decisions from the GBC. So this was the state of affairs of the GBC in 1972. Instead of getting better, they appeared to be getting worse. So

could they improve themselves in 1973? Well, let us hear what Srila Prabhupada said in this room conversation recorded on 3rd January 1973, just about two and a half years after the GBC was formed. Dr. Raghuram R. That means if GBC is valued as much as the GBC, they are themselves falling short. They are falling because. So, here you see, GBC's failure. These were the words of Shaila Prabhupada. That means, in 1973, two and a half years after the GBC was formed, it was still struggling. Would things improve with more time? About four years after the GBC was formed, Shaila Prabhupada wrote this letter to Hansadutta on 12th September 1974. "I made the GBC to give me relief, but if you do like this, then where is the relief? It is anxiety for me. This is the difficulty that as soon as one gets power, he becomes whimsical and spoils everything. What can I do?"

**Key Quote:** "Now has the GBC become more than Guru Maharaj?"
**Summary:** This segment reveals the GBC's awareness of their inability to govern effectively and Srila Prabhupada's concern that they were not focusing on spiritual life.

So, you see, the situation didn't seem to have improved much in 1974. Compared to what Shaila Prabhupada said in 1971. In 1971, Shaila Prabhupada said that GBC was not giving him any relief. And three years later, in 1974, Shaila Prabhupada was repeating the same thing. No relief from the GBC. A couple of months after this letter, some of the GBC members, namely Jaitirtha, Tamalkrishna, Hridayananda and Satsarupa, wrote this letter to their GBC Godbrothers on November 4, 1974. "As we know, Shaila Prabhupada has been disappointed in the ability of the GBC to effectively govern our ISKCON society." So, even the GBC was aware that they were unable to effectively govern ISKCON as late as November 1974. But did that awareness translate into improved performance? Almost a year later, Shaila Prabhupada wrote this letter to Jaitirtha, a GBC member, on 16th October 1975. "My only grievance is that I appointed GBC to give me relief from the management. But on the contrary, complaints and counter complaints are coming to me. Then how my brain can be peaceful?" So, things definitely hadn't improved from 1971 to 1975. What Shaila Prabhupada said in 1971 that the GBC was not giving him relief was the same thing Shaila Prabhupada repeated in 1974 as well as in 1975. About a month later, Shaila Prabhupada wrote this letter to Alal Nath on 10th of November 1975. "Now has the GBC become more than Guru Maharaj? As if simply GBC is meant for looking after pounds, shilling, pence. The GBC does not look after spiritual life. That's a defect. All of our students will have to become Guru, but they are not qualified. This is the difficult." Now that was a skating assessment from Shaila Prabhupada. The GBC were trying to become more than Shaila Prabhupada. All his students wanted to become Guru, but they were not qualified.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the conflicts within the GBC and Srila Prabhupada's assessment that some members were not following the regulative principles.

Those were Shaila Prabhupada's words of anguish. Sadly, things with the GBC did not improve in the next year either. Harikesha wrote this letter to Tamal Krishna on July 24, 1976 about the GBC. About Shaila Prabhupada. Then he said, he meaning Shaila Prabhupada. Then he said that if there are conflicts, they should be resolved amongst the GBC. He explained, meaning Shaila Prabhupada explained. He explained that these conflicts arise if there is not following of the regulative principles of chanting, etc. If these are not practiced, then there will be disturbances. One who does not chant properly or follow the principles should neither accept the post, remain in the post. He should resign for the basic qualification is not material but spiritual that the GBC member must be spiritually qualified and strong. So, even as late as 1976, there were conflicts within the GBC that they were unable to resolve. And in Srila Prabhupada's assessment, some of the GBCs were not even chanting properly or following the regulatory principles as per Srila Prabhupada and this is in 1976. This was just a little more than a year before Srila Prabhupada's disappearance and over six years of functioning of the GBC.

**Summary:** This segment highlights that even in 1977, Srila Prabhupada and his disciples knew that the GBC members were conditioned souls, leading to deviations in governance.

That the GBC were lacking was evident not only to Srila Prabhupada but even to the GBCs themselves as revealed by Tamal Krishnamaraj in a room conversation with Srila Prabhupada on 22nd of April 1977, which is a few months. Months before Prabhupada's disappearance. Listen to this portion of the conversation. "Well, I have studied myself and all of your disciples and it is clear fact that we are all conditioned souls. So, we cannot be good. Maybe one day it may be possible, not now." So you see, as late as 1977, April 1977, Srila Prabhupada knew that his GBCs were all conditioned souls. Yes. His disciples knew it too. So, we can see that all through its history, the GBC underperformed in its function of governance. Hence, it is not surprising that the GBC deviated en masse in 1978 by unauthorizedly appointing devotees as Diksha Gurus. And they continue to deviate in many ways in the system of Diksha, in the system of Deity worship, book changes, etc. The GBC themselves were conditioned.

**Key Quote:** "Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the GBC's poor performance, their acknowledgment of being weakened by the zonal Acharya deviation, and the need to fulfill their responsibilities by reverting to Srila Prabhupada's original systems.

You see, some of the ancestors themselves confessed about their poor performance in governing ISKCON in Resolution No. 403 of 1999, where in their apology to ISKCON they resolved. Whereas despite warnings by Pradyumna Prabhu and others, for many years the governing body commission being weakened, governing body commission being weakened, due to the zonal Acharya's deviation. You see, these are the words of the GBC themselves. 333и governing body commission being weakened due to the zonal acharya deviation failed to correct these errors to the detriment of many ISKCON members. Already the GBC was not performing up to the mark on the governance front even in 1977. Now the GBC accepts that they were further weakened by the zonal acharya deviation, Diksha Guru deviation in 1978. Although they don't acknowledge it, the poorly performing GBC continues to be weakened even today in his governance of ISKCON due to the unauthorized guru system that they persist with. There have been many well-meaning devotees in the GBC body. Many of them may have been personally very good devotees. They may not have had any ill intentions themselves. But it is a fact that because they were never a well-performing GBC as a body meant for governance, they made terrible mistakes which led to deviations in the system of initiations, book changes, deity worship, etc. We have nothing personally against the individual members of the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group. But all devotees in ISKCON need to know their history. Remember, those who forget history are condemned to repeat it. The GBC should fulfill its responsibility of properly governing ISKCON. By removing all the deviations and reverting to the systems that Srila Prabhupada instituted originally, the Rithvik system of initiations, the method of deity worship in offering everything to the Diksha Guru first, rolling back the book changes, etc. Then the GBC will be truly performing its role of governance up to the expectations of Srila Prabhupada and all the

**Summary:** This segment describes Srila Prabhupada's pivotal role in building ISKCON, emphasizing his transcendental vision and potency as the driving force behind the movement's rapid expansion.

Srila Prabhupada built up from scratch a worldwide organization in a relatively short span of 12 years, from 1965 to 1977. In fact, in 9 years, from 1968 to 1977, in Srila Prabhupada's own words. This was because from 1965 to 1968, not much progress was made in spreading ISKCON, especially with Srila Prabhupada's frail health in 1967. It was actually after 1968 that the movement really took off. In a lecture in 1971, Srila Prabhupada said, in this lecture given on 15th February 1971, "So, practically we began work from 1968. 66 I started, but in 67 I became very much sick. So, I came back to India and again I went there in 1968. Practically this propaganda work began vigorously from 1968." During this time between 1965 to 1977, Srila Prabhupada wrote books prolifically while he guided his spiritually naive young disciples in the nuances of detail of community worship, Vaishnava culture, hygiene standards, personal attire and the like. Simultaneously, Srila Prabhupada stitched together the disparate but sincere attempts of his disciples into a coherent force resoundingly heard across countries. The world sat up and took notice, not because of the genius marketing strategies, masterminded by some devotee, but by the transcendental vision and potency of the pure devotee, Srila Prabhupada.

**Summary:** This section uses the analogy of an orchestra to illustrate how Srila Prabhupada coordinated the efforts of his disciples, maintaining order and preventing deviations within the growing ISKCON organization.

Srila Prabhupada was like the lens which concentrates the divergent rays of the sun into a searing focal point. What otherwise appeared like random attempts by the devotees to spread the moment was coordinated by Srila Prabhupada into a symphony which rose elegantly in time. Srila Prabhupada was the expert conductor of this orchestra. Without Srila Prabhupada, it would have been nothing but cacophony. Everything was happening at a frenetic pace. Books were being published in an unending stream. Devotees were joining in droves, and temples were being opened in every nook and cranny of the world. The world was proving to be too small for the devotees. Unsurprisingly, although everything was expanding at a scorching pace between 1965 and 1977, nothing was haphazard or mindless. There was a method to the madness, and this was unsurprising given how Srila Prabhupada knew exactly what needed to be done, when and how in all matters. Srila Prabhupada was the sutradhara, the puppeteer, deftly coordinating the whole show into one smooth integrated growth in unison without any discord. Any slight deviations were dealt with swiftly and promptly, never allowing the organization to drift in any unwanted direction.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Srila Prabhupada gradually developed the Rittvik system of initiations, appointing representatives to initiate disciples on his behalf, leading to questions from the GBC.

While Srila Prabhupada did all this, he also gradually built up the rittvik system of initiations by appointing his representatives who would initiate new disciples on his behalf. Although, such appointments appeared to be a result of random adjustments to address practical difficulties and challenges as they arose, in reality, those circumstances were only instrumental in the implementation of an already existing, well thought out system in Srila Prabhupada's vision for initiations in the moment, which could run for eternity. Srila Prabhupada as always knew precisely what he was doing and why, being the sharp transcendental visionary that he was. But this was not obvious to all, and hence, the GBC on the 28th of May 1977 decided to ask Srila Prabhupada how initiations would be conducted in ISKCON, particularly at the time when Srila Prabhupada was no longer with us.

**Key Quote:** "He would appoint some of his disciples as officiating Acharyas."
**Summary:** This segment details Srila Prabhupada's response to the GBC's inquiry about initiations, explaining his plan to appoint officiating Acharyas and addressing common arguments against the Rittvik system.

Since Srila Prabhupada had already been, over the years, putting in a system for this very purpose, he immediately responded without the need to mull over it. He would appoint some of his disciples as officiating Acharyas. That is, the disciples who would officiate on behalf of the Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, would be appointed soon. And not very much later, this appointment did come. It came on the 9th of July 1977. While Srila Prabhupada may have thoughtfully implemented the Rithvik system for all time in ISKCON, with deliberate purpose, it did raise many questions in the minds of the naysayers. Some of the questions are listed like this: The Rithvik system is against tradition. This is one argument. Another one, no other Acharya has ever done this. The third one, the law of disciplic succession is that one who is now the disciple becomes the Guru next. The fourth point, in the Rithvik system, there is no opportunity for Srila Prabhupada to reject a disciple if he wishes to. And another argument, Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya: One must approach a spiritual master, surrender to him, ask him questions, and serve him. In the Rithvik system, there is no opportunity for the disciple to ask the spiritual master questions or to receive instructions on his service. And many more arguments like this. It appears from these questions that the Rithvik system of initiations appears to violate the principles of Diksha or initiation. In this video, we will attempt to gain an overview of what constitutes initiation in order to get a better understanding of the Rithvik system of initiations. Once we do that, most questions will naturally get resolved once we have this overview properly. First of all,

**Key Quote:** "Diksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity."
**Summary:** The speaker defines Diksha (initiation) according to Srila Jeeva Goswami, emphasizing the awakening of transcendental knowledge and the vanquishing of sinful reactions as its core essence.

how does Srila Prabhupada define Diksha or initiation? Srila Prabhupada, in his purport to verse number 331 of chapter 24 of the Madhya Leela of the Chaitanya Charitamrita, mentions, "As far as Diksha is concerned, one should consult Madhya Leela, chapter 15, verse 108." And if we go to Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhya Leela, chapter 15, verse 108 purport, there Srila Prabhupada says, "Srila Jeeva Goswami explains Diksha in his Bhakti Sandarbha, verse 283: divyam jnanam yato dadyat kuryat papasya sankshayam tasma dikshe tisa prokta desikais tattva kovidaihi. Diksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of the revealed scriptures knows this process as Diksha." So, essentially, as per the definition given by Srila Jeeva Goswami, Diksha or initiation constitutes two fundamental things: One is awakening transcendental knowledge and the second is vanquishing all sinful reactions. This is the real essence of Diksha or initiation.

Now, let us list down some of the commonly understood components of initiation or Diksha. Some of them are like this: 1. The spiritual master gives instructions to the disciple about his service. 2. The disciple inquires about his spiritual doubts from the spiritual master, from the Diksha Guru. 3. The disciple serves the spiritual master by carrying out his instructions. 4. The disciple surrenders to the Diksha Guru. 5. A fire yajna is conducted to formalize the acceptance of the spiritual master by the disciple. 6. After the yajna, a new spiritual name is given to the disciple. 7. Sanctified beads are handed over to the disciple who vows to chant the prescribed number of rounds of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra on those beads. All previous karmic reactions of the disciple are destroyed. This is point number 8. And point number 9: Transcendental knowledge is revealed in the heart of the disciple by the Diksha Guru. Number 10: The Diksha Guru takes responsibility to take the disciple back to Godhead. So, these are some of the commonly understood components of initiation or Diksha.

**Summary:** The speaker categorizes the components of Diksha into physical/personal, ceremonial, and transcendental aspects, providing a structured overview of the initiation process.

All these components of Diksha or initiation may be summarized in a table as you can see on the screen now. Under the first column of physical or personal aspects are listed the activities of Guru instructs on service of the disciple. Disciple carries out the instructions of the Diksha Guru. Diksha Guru clears the spiritual doubts and corrects the disciple's mistakes. These activities require a physically present person to instruct, to correct, to clear specific doubts, etc. Hence, we have included them under the physical or personal aspect. Now, under the second column of ceremonial aspects are listed the activities of formal surrender by the disciple to the Diksha Guru, formal acceptance by the Diksha Guru of the disciple, initiation yajna, Diksha yajna, initiation sacrifice, sanctified beads being handed over to the disciple, and new spiritual name being selected for the disciple. These are generally related to the initiation ceremony or the Diksha ceremony. Therefore, we have called this the ceremonial aspects of Diksha. Under the third column of transcendental aspects are listed the activities of disciple accepting the Diksha Guru in his heart and vice versa, the Guru accepting the disciple. Then the Guru reveals transcendental knowledge in the heart of the disciple. Then the Diksha Guru destroys previous karma of the disciple and the Diksha Guru takes the disciple back to Godhead.

Now, let us go through a few quotes of Srila Prabhupada on the matter of the components listed under the physical or personal aspects column. Here is what Srila Prabhupada said on this matter on various occasions. "Similarly, the GBC member means they will see that in every temple, these books are very thoroughly being read and discussed and understood and applied in practical life. The GBC can supervise the things that are going on. The first management is that each and every member in the temple is chanting extremely long things and following the regulations. The representative of all five members must see that the members are chanting. So all GBC members must see that in every temple everyone is engaged. So the purpose of having in the society is to show the devotees how they can always be in 24 hours engaged according to your... Yes, that is helping one another. If I am deficient, by seeing your example, I shall correct myself. This is the idea. Not that a fool's paradise. All fools join together. Not like that. There should be ideal life. At least the leaders, the president, the GBC, they will show the example and they will follow." Srila Prabhupada, there is also a question of reciprocation. You have so many disciples, thousands. And one devotee was asking me yesterday, I want to please Srila Prabhupada. How does he know my progress and my service when I am so far away from him and if I don't write him? So there is a representative there, the president, the GBC. They will see. The representative may be there, but what is my personal relationship? To obey your spiritual master. Whatever he has said, you follow strictly. Follow the regulative principle, chant sixteen now. That's all. What happens when that inevitable time comes when a successor is needed? He is asking about the future. Who will guide the movement in the future? They will guide. I am training them. Will there be one spiritual leader though? I am training GBC 18 all over the world. His personal secretaries. I see. To see that the original teachings that Prabhupada has given are not in any way changed. In addition to whatever you just heard, in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Adi Leela, chapter 1, verse 35 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "A devotee must have only one initiating spiritual master, because in the scriptures, acceptance of more than one is always forbidden. There is no limit, however, to the number of instructing spiritual masters one may accept. Generally, a spiritual master who constantly instructs a disciple in spiritual science becomes his initiating spiritual master later on."

#### Diksha, delegation, Srila Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada delegated the aspect of initiation or Deeksha which requires physical presence."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Srila Prabhupada delegated the physical and personal aspects of initiation to temple presidents and GBCs, who act as Siksha Gurus, while Srila Prabhupada himself delivers spiritual instructions through his books.

From this, from whatever you have heard until now, we can see clearly that Srila Prabhupada delegated the aspect of initiation or Diksha which requires physical presence. Srila Prabhupada delegated that to the temple presidents and to the GBCs. The temple presidents and the GBCs are supposed to be Siksha Gurus taking care of correcting, clearing doubts and assigning services to the devotees. Srila Prabhupada through his books delivers spiritual instructions to the disciples which we have classified as revealing transcendental knowledge within the heart under the column transcendental aspects. But if any devotee is in doubt after reading Srila Prabhupada's books, what does he do? Whom does he go to clear his doubts? Those doubts are to be cleared by the temple president and the GBC which falls under the first column which is called the physical or personal aspects. But of course, this does not limit Prabhupada. In many cases, some devotee has some doubt. He just opens some book of Prabhupada and starts reading or hears some lecture. Prabhupada can directly also clear those doubts. Thus, it is evident that Srila Prabhupada delegated the aspect of the initiation process or Diksha which requires physical or personal presence. Srila Prabhupada delegated that to the temple presidents and the GBCs or the senior devotees in the movement.

**Key Quote:** "So far as Gayathri initiations are concerned, the tape is not required."
**Summary:** This section presents letters from Srila Prabhupada authorizing senior devotees to perform ceremonial aspects of initiation, such as chanting the Gayatri Mantra and conducting fire ceremonies.

Now, let us look at the next aspect which is the ceremonial aspect. In a letter to Karandhara written on 13th of April 1971, Srila Prabhupada wrote, "So far as Gayathri initiations are concerned, the tape is not required. You have the threads chanted on by me and now I am enclosing here with copies of Gayathri Mantra, one for each of the seven disciples to be initiated. Hold a fire ceremony. Chant Gayathri Mantra to them individually, and let them hear and repeat. Then offer the threads on my behalf. The fire sacrifice should be performed as usual." Here, Srila Prabhupada authorized the temple president to chant the Gayathri Mantra into the ear of the devotee being initiated. In another letter to Nithyananda written on 29th of September 1972, Srila Prabhupada said something similar to what he wrote in his 1970 letter which we saw just now. So, in 1972 also, in this letter to Nithyananda, Srila Prabhupada said, "Now hold the ceremony as per the enclosed instructions. During the fire ceremony, you can also give the sacred thread and Gayathri Mantra to Bhudhara, which I am enclosing also here with. Teach him to chant on the finger divisions and play the copy of the tape of me reciting Gayathri Mantra into his right ear. Also, I am sending the beads for Michael Lightfoot duly chanted by me under separate post. So, you may hold the fire yajna, install DTs and give initiation to these two boys." In this letter, Srila Prabhupada said a recorded tape of his could be used for Gayathri initiation.

**Summary:** More letters from Srila Prabhupada are presented, showing the delegation of chanting on beads to senior devotees and the authorization of temple presidents to conduct fire yajnas and announce spiritual names.

In yet another letter to Bhutatma written on 5th of January 1973, Srila Prabhupada wrote, "Upon your recommendation, I am very glad to accept the six new students as my duly initiated disciples. Their letter is enclosed herewith. As for chanting on their beads, I have delegated Kirtananda Swami to chant on the new devotees beads on my behalf in your country. In Europe, Revatinandan Swami will chant on the new devotees beads on my behalf, because it is such long distance, therefore it is very expensive to send beads air mail from here. And there are so many instances of the beads being lost in that way. And I am getting now requests up to 20 or 30 each week. So, it is practically becoming impossible for me to chant the beads when I am so far distant. Therefore, the new devotees may send their beads to Kirtananda in New Vrindavan and he will chant the beads and send back to them. Is this all right? Now hold the fire Ejna and give also second initiation to Sarva Darshan, Ejnapati and Hari Vallabh. Enclosed, please find three sacred threads duly chanted by me along with three copies of Gayathri Mantra. Now hold the fire Ejna for all nine devotees and for the second initiates, teach them how to chant on the finger divisions and play for them the tape of me reciting Gayathri Mantra into their right ear." So, here we can see that Srila Prabhupada authorized senior devotees to chant on the beads and the temple president to conduct the Ejna to hand over the beads and announce the spiritual name of the devotee being initiated.

**Key Quote:** "They shall, of course, still be considered as my disciples. Not that they shall become your disciples."
**Summary:** This segment clarifies that devotees initiated through Rittviks are still disciples of Srila Prabhupada, with the Rittviks empowered to chant on the beads, establishing the bond between Srila Prabhupada and the disciple.

So, whose disciples would the devotees become? And what is the significance of chanting on the beads? In a letter to Revati Nandan written on 4th of January 1973, Srila Prabhupada explained this. "Just now I have received some more requests for giving first initiation from Dhananjaya. And now I am receiving weekly not less than 10 to 15 such requests from new students. So, it is becoming very expensive to send so many sets of beads such long distance, and it has become little bothersome for me also. So, I think now you may be appointed by me to give first initiations to new disciples by chanting on their beads on my behalf. In America, Kirtananda Swami is doing that. So, now if there are two of you, that will give me great relief. Kirtananda will chant on the beads for new devotees in America, Canada, like that. You can chant on the beads for the European continent new disciples. They shall, of course, still be considered as my disciples, not that they shall become your disciples, but you will be empowered by me to chant their beads, and that is the same effect of binding master and disciple as if I were personally chanting." So, the senior devotees who are acting as Rithwiks were empowered by Srila Prabhupada to chant on the beads, thus, binding Srila Prabhupada as the Diksha Guru or spiritual master to the disciple.

**Key Quote:** "The chanting Hare Krishna is our main business. That is real initiation."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspects of Diksha to senior devotees and emphasizes the importance of the transcendental aspects of initiation, such as chanting Hare Krishna.

Now, it is clear that Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspects of the process of Diksha or initiation, the Diksha Vidhana to the senior devotees. And on July 9th, Srila Prabhupada delegated the choosing of names also to the Rithwiks. Now, let us look at a few more quotes of Srila Prabhupada with respect to the last column, the transcendental aspects column. In a letter to Tamal Krishna written on 19th of August 1968, Srila Prabhupada wrote, "The chanting Hare Krishna is our main business. That is real initiation. And as you are all following my instruction, in that matter, the initiator is already there. Now, the next initiation will be performed as a ceremony officially. Of course, that ceremony has value because the name, holy name will be delivered to the student from the disciplic succession. It has got value. But in spite of that, as you are going on chanting, please go on with this business sincerely, and Krishna willing, I may be coming to you very soon." In another letter to Jadurani written on 4th of September 1972, Srila Prabhupada wrote, "The eternal bond between disciples and spiritual master begins from the first day he hears. Just like my spiritual master, in 1922, he said in our first meeting, 'You are educated boys. Why don't you preach this cult?' That was the beginning. Now, it is coming to fact. Therefore, the relationship began from that day." From these quotes of Srila Prabhupada, we can see how Srila Prabhupada placed more emphasis on the transcendental aspects rather than on the ceremonial aspects or the personal or physical aspects of the process of initiation to act.

**Key Quote:** "But without the transcendental aspects, the ceremonial aspects will not bear fruit."
**Summary:** This section highlights the significance of the transcendental aspects of initiation, such as destroying sins and awakening transcendental knowledge, as the core essence of Diksha.

As Srila Prabhupada says, the ceremony has its place and importance, but without the transcendental aspects, the ceremonial aspects will not bear fruit. Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspect of initiation to the rithwiks, namely, chanting on the beads, selecting the spiritual names, etc. And he delegated to the temple presidents the conducting of the fire yajna, handing over the beads and announcing the name. So like this, Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspects to the rithwiks and to the temple presidents. And Srila Prabhupada started delegating this aspect to the temple presidents and GBCs from as early as 1970. Finally, when Srila Prabhupada had personally overseen the successful implementation of this delegation of the ceremonial aspects as well as the personal or physical aspects over the next seven years from 1970 till 1977, Srila Prabhupada gave it a solid stamp of finality via the directive on July 9th, 1977. Now what Srila Prabhupada did not delegate to his representatives, the temple presidents, the GBCs and the rithwiks is the transcendental aspect of initiation. Let us look at a few more quotes of Srila Prabhupada. In the purport to the Chaitanya Charitamrita Madhyalila, Chapter 15, verse number 108, purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Srila Jeeva Goswami explains deeksha in his Bhaktisandharbha, verse 283, divyam jnanam yathodadhyat kuryat papasya sankshayam tasma deeksheti saa prokta deshikai statva kovidaihi. Deeksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of the revealed scriptures knows this process as deeksha."

**Key Quote:** "Deeksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the importance of Deity worship as a means to rectify material conditioning and establish a personal relationship with the Lord through initiation.

Further, in the same purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "It is Srimad Bhagavatam's opinion that the process of Deity worship is not actually necessary. Just as the specific prescriptions of the Pancharatra and other scriptures do not have to be followed, the Bhagavatam enjoins that even without practising Deity worship, one can achieve the complete success of human life by any of the other devotional processes, such as simply offering oneself at the Lord's feet for His protection. Nonetheless, Vaishnavas following the path of Sri Narada and his successors endeavour to establish a personal relationship with the Lord by receiving the grace of a bona fide spiritual master through initiation, and in this tradition, the devotees are obliged at the time of initiation to begin engaging in Deity worship. Although Deity worship is not essential, the material conditioning of most candidates for devotional service requires that they engage in this activity. When we consider their bodily and mental conditions, we find that the character of such candidates is impure and their minds are agitated. Therefore, to rectify this material conditioning, the great sage Narada and others have at different times recommended various kinds of regulations for Deity worship." As we can see, the transcendental aspect of initiation consists of destroying the sins of the disciple, awakening the transcendental knowledge in the heart, and taking the disciple back to Godhead, which are actually the crux or the heart or the essence of initiation or Diksha.

**Key Quote:** "And these aspects cannot be delegated."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that the transcendental aspects of initiation cannot be delegated and must be performed directly by an Uttama Adhikari, explaining how the Rittvik system allows Srila Prabhupada to retain these aspects.

And these aspects cannot be delegated. They have to be performed only by an Uttama Adhikari or Mahabhagavata spiritual master Diksha Guru directly. So, the final table of the different aspects of initiation looks like this. Take a look at this. The first column, physical or personal aspects, were delegated to temple presidents, GBCs, and senior devotees. The second column, ceremonial aspects, were delegated to the rittviks and to the temple presidents. And the third column, transcendental aspects, were retained by Srila Prabhupada. The other aspects of physical or personal presence and ceremony may be even done away with completely, as we can see how Srila Narada Muni initiated Murugari or Dhruva Maharaj. But the transcendental aspects cannot be done away with. Hence, Srila Prabhupada via the rittvik system delegated the two aspects of initiation which are not mandatorily to be performed by an Uttama Adhikari: The physical or personal aspects and the ceremonial aspects. Both of these can be done by devotees who may not be on that Uttama Adhikari platform. At the same time, Srila Prabhupada continues to retain the transcendental aspect of initiation, and thus, he continues to rule the hearts of those who become devotees of Krishna by reading his books and becoming attached to his temples. So, you can see from this table that these arguments like rittvik system is not valid because there is no guru to instruct on service, according to tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya words, does not hold good because that's a personal or physical aspect which may not be essential. Then, there is no guru to clear your doubts. Even that is not applicable in the rittvik system. And there is nobody to correct the devotees, the disciples' mistakes. Even that doesn't hold good. So, all the arguments which are brought up against the rittvik system is centered around the personal or physical aspect which has been already addressed in the rittvik system of initiations. Prabhupada has already addressed it. So, using those arguments, you cannot invalidate the rittvik system of initiations because if you see the entire system of giving deeksha, the personal or physical aspect and the ceremonial aspect are only one portion of the entire deeksha vidhana, the process of deeksha, and they are not the most important part of deeksha. The most important part of deeksha is the transcendental aspect which Prabhupada is doing, he is continuing to do, which he was doing before 1977 and even now also he is continuing to do without the necessity of his personal physical presence.

**Key Quote:** "Even before 1977, all the transcendental aspects of the deeksha was being performed by Prabhupada without requiring his personal physical presence."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses arguments against the Rittvik system, stating that they focus on the physical aspects, while the transcendental aspects, which are the most important, are still being performed by Srila Prabhupada.

Even before 1977, all the transcendental aspects of the deeksha was being performed by Prabhupada without requiring his personal physical presence. There were so many devotees in ISKCON who got initiated who might never have met Srila Prabhupada but all the transcendental aspects were fully fulfilled. So therefore, these kind of arguments which are focusing on the personal or physical aspect to say that a living guru is essential is looking at the whole process of deeksha in a very narrow frame and therefore we should not get caught up by these kind of arguments which are not having a proper overview of the entire initiation process. Thus we can see clearly that there is nothing against tradition or any law of disciplic succession. None of these things are being violated by the Rithvik system instituted in ISKCON by Srila Prabhupada personally particularly for the time when Srila Prabhupada is no longer with us.

**Summary:** The speaker defends the Rittvik system, emphasizing its authenticity and the dangers of alternative systems developed by less enlightened individuals, referencing Prahlada Maharaj's warning about blind leaders.

The very fact that Srila Prabhupada built up this system of initiations over several years between 1970 and 1977 just like he did with all other aspects of the transcendental organization of ISKCON speaks volumes about the efficacy and authenticity of the Rithvik system. This Rithvik system of initiations was given to us by a fully enlightened personality with transcendental vision. Any other system developed by persons who are not similarly enlightened is fraught with dangers and pitfalls. Like Srila Prabhupada often quoted Prahlada Maharaj who said that blind people following blind leaders are bound to end up in a ditch. The ISKCON Mumbai Group's GBC has invented a system of a managerial board indicating no objection to Diksha Gurus in ISKCON. There is absolutely no evidence to support this invention of no-objection gurus. There is no evidence either by way of tradition or parampara or shastra or Srila Prabhupada's direct order. And by their own admission in their resolution number 409 of 2004 they don't know if anybody in ISKCON is a pure devotee or not. Any system like this no-objection guru system in ISKCON which has been invented by such conditioned souls is definitely pervaded by the defects of cheating, errors, illusions and imperfections. Hence, the Rithvik system of initiations ordered by Srila Prabhupada the pure devotee in ISKCON who is beyond all the four defects which plague the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai is the safest path for those whose goal in life is to go back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "Avoid the Rithvik system at your own peril which is actually what the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group has said in their resolution number 409 of 2004"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes with a strong critique of the ISKCON Mumbai group's 'no-objection guru system,' arguing that it lacks scriptural support and urging devotees to follow Srila Prabhupada's directive to implement the Rittvik system.

Avoid the Rithvik system at your own peril which is actually what the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group has said in their resolution number 409 of 2004 and the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group for those who keep asking in which tradition is a Rithvik system of initiations followed please think before you ask. Every tradition has a beginning somewhere. The beginning will be some Acharya or the other. Acharyas have the authority and the power to start new traditions. The question that Rithvik system has never been followed in any tradition presumptuously assumes that Srila Prabhupada is not empowered he is not authorized he is not powerful enough to start new traditions. But the GBC thinks that they are better than Srila Prabhupada. Why? Because they can start a new tradition of a managerial board like the GBC indicating no objection to Diksha Gurus. But Srila Prabhupada is not powerful enough to start a new tradition of a Rithvik system of initiations. This kind of attitude of the GBC towards Srila Prabhupada is very offensive, and this question of asking about tradition to support the Rithvik system of initiations ordered by Srila Prabhupada is actually very disrespectful towards Srila Prabhupada. Hence instead of asking Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group devotees in which tradition is the Rithvik system of initiations practiced the devotees of the ISKCON Mumbai group should be questioning their GBC about their resolution number 409 of 2004 which states that when the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating it does not thereby endorse him as an Uttam Adhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. Rather the GBC indicates that it has no objection to saying that the devotees of the ISKCON Mumbai group should please ask their GBC in which tradition is it found that a GBC body indicates no objection to allow devotees to act as a Diksha Guru. Also please ask them why they are not obeying Srila Prabhupada's order on July 9, 1977 to conduct initiations in the ISKCON Mumbai group. The devotees of the ISKCON Mumbai group should conduct initiations in ISKCON via Ritviks. That is the real question to be asked. Instead of following the offensive no objection Guru system of the ISKCON Mumbai group please follow Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group's system of Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive to implement Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON and remain free from offences to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada. Hare Krishna Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada

**Summary:** The speaker discusses GBC Resolution No. 405, which mandates daily guru puja for Srila Prabhupada for all devotees in ISKCON.

In reaction to the constant guru fall-downs, the GBC has been chopping and changing the unauthorized guru system as well as their understanding of the functions, qualifications, and characteristics. In the year 1999, the GBC passed Resolution No. 405, titled Standards of Guru Worship in ISKCON, and the GBC made it into a law in ISKCON. It has become an ISKCON law. As part of this ISKCON law, the GBC resolved, under subsection C of this Resolution No. 405, in order to offer appropriate respect to Srila Prabhupada as founder acharya and pre-eminent spiritual master of ISKCON. It is considered an essential devotional practice for all ISKCON devotees to observe or perform Srila Prabhupada's guru puja daily, either in an ISKCON temple or, if not possible, in one's home. So, the GBC made it mandatory for all devotees in ISKCON, irrespective of who was their diksha guru, to perform guru puja for Srila Prabhupada daily, either in the temple or at home.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that while daily guru puja is mandated for Srila Prabhupada, guru puja for diksha gurus is limited to once a year and is optional, and that all disciples are to be instructed that Srila Prabhupada is their pre-eminent Shiksha Guru.

While the GBC mandated daily guru puja for Srila Prabhupada, in subsection D of the same resolution of the same ISKCON law, the GBC resolved this about their unauthorized diksha guru puja. With an aim to focus more fully on Srila Prabhupada, and every devotee's special relationship with him and to correct any imbalance in application between the respect offered to shiksha gurus, diksha gurus or other senior Vaisnavas contributing to a devotee's spiritual progress, an ISKCON shiksha or diksha guru may have public Guru Puja, Aarati and or foot bathing in person once a year on ISKCON property as a Vyasa Puja. So, the disciples of the unauthorized Gurus may offer, may offer means it's not mandatory, it is optional. The disciples may offer Guru Puja to their Gurus in person only once a year in ISKCON. Further, in subsection J, the GBC law states, at the time of diksha initiation, all disciples will be further instructed by their initiating guru that Srila Prabhupada is their pre-eminent Siksha Guru as ISKCON's founder Acharya, ever present in His books and teachings. Thus, they have a recognized Siksha Guru.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the significance of considering Srila Prabhupada as the pre-eminent Shiksha Guru and analyzes the meaning of the Sri Guru Vandana, particularly the phrase 'Shri Guru Charanapadma'.

So, the disciples of the Unauthorized Gurus may offer Guru Puja to their Gurus in person link to Srila Prabhupada. That means, in ISKCON, every devotee is supposed to consider Srila Prabhupada as his pre-eminent Shiksha Guru, except, of course, for those initiated before 1978. So, for their pre-eminent Shiksha Guru, Srila Prabhupada, the devotees during the Guru Puja, sing the Shri Guru Vandana song penned by Shri Launarothamadas Thakur daily, every day, mandatorily. In this song, that every devotee in ISKCON must compulsorily sing for Srila Prabhupada every single day of his life, it begins with Shri Guru Charanapadma Kevala Bhakati Sadma, meaning, Srila Prabhupada's lotus feet are the shelter of Shri Guru. In the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 15, verse 108 purport, Srila Prabhupada quotes Shri Launarothamadas Thakur from his Bhakti Sandarbha, where Shri Launarothamadas Thakur says, Deeksha Vidhanena Shri Guru Charana Sampaditam. Shri Launarothamadas Thakur translates this as, Receiving the Grace of a bona fide spiritual master through initiation. That means, receiving the mercy of Guru or Shri Guru Charanapadma happens through initiation. In other words, Shri Guru Charanapadma in the Guru Vandana refers to the Deeksha Guru, not just to some preeminent Deeksha Guru. And then, the devotees, have to sing, Vandohmui Savadahana Mate, meaning, I bow down to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada with great awe and reverence.

Of course, the one who takes the responsibility to deliver the devotee across the material existence to the lotus feet of Krishna? Is it the responsibility of the Shiksha Guru or is it the responsibility of the Diksha Guru?"
**Summary:** The speaker questions whether the Shiksha Guru or the Diksha Guru is responsible for delivering the disciple from material existence, referencing Srila Prabhupada's statements in the Chaitanya Charitamrita.

So, every devotee in ISKCON has to take shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada. What is the meaning of taking shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada? We will come to that a bit later, towards the end of the Guru Vandana. Please bear with us till then. For now, let us go on to the next line. And what is that next line? Jahara Prasade Bhai, Ebhava Toriyajai, Krishna Prapti Hoi Jaha Hoite. Meaning, by Srila Prabhupada's grace, because we are singing this song for Prabhupada, this is an offering to Prabhupada, so by Srila Prabhupada's grace, we can cross over the material existence and we can attain Krishna. That means, every devotee in ISKCON must sing every single day of his life that he can cross over the material existence and attain Krishna by Srila Prabhupada's grace. Now, the question arises that who takes the responsibility to deliver the physical life of the human being? Of course, the one who takes the responsibility to deliver the devotee across the material existence to the lotus feet of Krishna? Is it the responsibility of the Shiksha Guru or is it the responsibility of the Diksha Guru? Let us see what Srila Prabhupada says in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 9, verse 61, purport. There, Srila Prabhupada says, it is the spiritual master who delivers the disciple from the clutches of Maya. How? By initiating him into the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. So clearly, it is the responsibility of the Diksha Guru to deliver the disciple from the material existence.

#### Diksha Guru, Material contamination, Srila Prabhupada, Spiritual perfection, ISKCON GBC

**Key Quote:** "So if the Diksha Guru delivers one from material contamination, why are the devotees in Eskan mandated to sing every day that it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers them from material existence?"
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the apparent contradiction in ISKCON's mandate for devotees to sing about Srila Prabhupada delivering them from material existence, while limiting the glorification of their Diksha Gurus.

In the Nectar of Instruction, purport to verse 7, Srila Prabhupada says, if one is sincere, he is initiated and this stage is called Bhajanak Kriya. One then actually engages in the service of the Lord by regularly chanting the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra 16 rounds daily and refraining from illicit sex, intoxicants, meat-eating and gambling. By Bhajanak Kriya, one attains freedom from the contamination of materialistic life. So if the Diksha Guru delivers one from material contamination, why are the devotees in ISKCON mandated to sing every day that it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers them from material existence? Instead of their Diksha Guru, they can sing about the Diksha Guru only once a day in a year. Whereas, they are singing every day to Srila Prabhupada 365 days a year, that it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers them from material existence. It is Prabhupada who delivers them from there, from the material existence. So how is it that the Shiksha Guru is delivering the disciple from the clutches of material existence whereas the Shiksha Guru is not doing it? While you ponder over that point, the whole situation becomes more complicated when the devotee sings the next line, Jai Prasad-e-Pure Sarva Asha, meaning that by Srila Prabhupada's song, all our desires for spiritual perfection will be fulfilled. So it is very clear that ISKCON GBC accepts that irrespective of who initiates the devotees in ISKCON, it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers the devotee from material existence. It is Srila Prabhupada who gives them Krishna and it is Srila Prabhupada who blesses them with spiritual perfection.

**Key Quote:** "But in the Sri Guru Vandana, ISKCON devotees are mandated to sing daily that Srila Prabhupada is their eternal spiritual master."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that ISKCON devotees are mandated to sing daily that Srila Prabhupada is their eternal spiritual master, questioning why the GBC directs devotees to consider Srila Prabhupada as their eternal spiritual master instead of their Diksha Guru.

Not only that, the song for Srila Prabhupada further goes, Chakudana Dilo Jai, Janmai Janmai Prabhu Sai, meaning every devotee in ISKCON, irrespective of who initiates him, accepts that Srila Prabhupada has given them the gift of transcendental vision, Chakudana Dilo Jai and that Srila Prabhupada is their spiritual master, life after life, Janmai Janmai Prabhu Sai. In the Krishna book, chapter 80, Srila Prabhupada says, there may be many spiritual masters who are initiated, but the initiator spiritual master is one. Initiator spiritual master is one, meaning life after life, he only is our Diksha Guru. No one else can be our Diksha Guru once we have taken initiation from a bona fide Diksha Guru. But in the Sri Guru Vandana, ISKCON devotees are mandated to sing daily that Srila Prabhupada is their eternal spiritual master, which is actually the point. This is the proposition of the Diksha Guru, not of just some pre-eminent Diksha Guru. Then why in the world is the GBC telling the devotees that they have to consider Srila Prabhupada as their eternal spiritual master, life after life, and not their so-called Diksha Guru?

**Key Quote:** "That Srila Prabhupada reveals transcendental knowledge in the heart."
**Summary:** The speaker points out that devotees sing that Srila Prabhupada reveals transcendental knowledge in the heart, which is a function of the Diksha Guru, according to Vedic injunctions.

Well, if that is not enough, next comes an even bigger blow to the unauthorized Guru system. This is what we have to sing in the Sri Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada, that Srila Prabhupada reveals transcendental knowledge in the heart. And in the Chaitanya Charitamrita Madhyalita, Chapter 4, verse 111 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Diksha actually means initiating a disciple with transcendental knowledge by which he becomes freed from all material contamination. You see, and in a lecture given on July 9th, 1971, Srila Prabhupada said this. In the Vedic injunction, it is stated that in order to learn that transcendental science, one must have taught the Guru or the spiritual master. Without approaching a spiritual master, there is no possibility of attaining enlightenment. This is what the Vedic injunction says. You see, and in a lecture given on July 9th, 1971, Srila Prabhupada said this. You see, and in a lecture given on July 9th, 1991, Srila Prabhupada said this. Without approaching a spiritual master, there is no possibility of attaining transcendental knowledge. So, Diksha, Divyam Jnanam Khyapati, the beginning. So that means, transcendental knowledge comes from the Diksha Guru. So, Divye Jnan Hurde Prakashito refers to the Diksha Guru, not to just any pre-eminent Shiksha Guru.

**Key Quote:** "So, the spiritual master is the mercy incarnation of Krishna. Which spiritual master? Preeminent Shikshaguru or initiating Dikshaguru, initiating spiritual master? Which spiritual master is this referring to?"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Srila Prabhupada is glorified as the ocean of mercy, the incarnation of Krishna's mercy, which is a characteristic of the Diksha Guru, questioning why the GBC mandates this glorification.

As if that was not enough, the devotees have to further sing to Srila Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada says, Krishnadekar, Krishnadekar, Krishnadekar, Krishnadekar. Guru Karunasindhu that Srila Prabhupada is the ocean of mercy. Again, in the Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita, Antalila, chapter 7, verse 12 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, the true Acharya, the spiritual master of the entire world, must be considered an incarnation of Krishna's mercy. So, the spiritual master is the mercy incarnation of Krishna. Which spiritual master? Preeminent Shikshaguru or initiating Dikshaguru, initiating spiritual master? Which spiritual master is this referring to? Srila Prabhupada explains in Srimad Bhagavatam, canto 4, chapter 21, verse 31 purport, as Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions of a person, immediately, upon his surrender unto him. Similarly, the external manifestation of Krishna, the representative of Krishna, who acts as the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple, immediately after the disciple's initiation. So, it is the spiritual master who gives initiation to the disciple. So, it is the spiritual master who gives initiation to the disciple. The Dikshaguru, who is the mercy incarnation of Krishna. So, why has the GBC mandated to all the devotees in ISKCON to glorify Srila Prabhupada daily, that Srila Prabhupada is the ocean of mercy, the Karuna Sindhu, meaning the manifestation of mercy of Krishna, or in other words, the Dikshaguru, that Srila Prabhupada is the Dikshaguru, and not one of the unauthorized Gurus, indicated no objection by the GBC.

**Key Quote:** "Haha Prabhu Karo Daya Deho More Paadachchaya, meaning, Srila Prabhupada, our spiritual master, please give us the shelter of your lotus feet."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the meaning of seeking shelter at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, connecting it to taking initiation from him, implying that Srila Prabhupada is acting as a Diksha Guru for all devotees in ISKCON.

So, if this much wasn't enough, next comes the killer punch. Going further, the devotees have to sing, Haha Prabhu Karo Daya Deho More Paadachchaya, meaning, Srila Prabhupada, our spiritual master, please give us the shelter of your lotus feet. Haha Prabhu Karo Daya Deho More Paadachchaya, meaning, Srila Prabhupada, our spiritual master, please give us the shelter of your lotus feet. Like the Sri Guru Vandana began with Vandomui Savadhana Mate, I bow down at your lotus feet with great reverence. Similarly, once more, the prayer here is seeking shelter at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada. So, we had told you at the beginning that let us wait towards the end of this Sri Guru Vandana to understand what is this seeking the shelter of the lotus feet mean? In the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 4, Chapter 29, Verse 55, purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this. Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. Not only that, in the Nectar of Devotion, Chapter 6, Srila Prabhupada says, all together, Srila Rupa Goswami mentions twenty items and all of them are very important. Out of the twenty, the first three, namely accepting the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, taking initiation from him and serving him with respect and reverence are the most important. So, taking shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, haha means to take initiation from Srila Prabhupada. So that means Srila Prabhupada is acting as a diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON by giving them shelter at his lotus feet.

**Summary:** The speaker questions the GBC's logic in mandating the Sri Guru Vandana for Srila Prabhupada while limiting the glorification of Diksha Gurus, highlighting the incongruity of the situation.

On the one hand, ISKCON Mumbai Group's GBC has declared that Srila Prabhupada is only a pre-eminent siksha guru. Although, Krishna alone knows what that means because the GBC has not defined what the word quote-unquote pre-eminent siksha guru means. I personally have tried searching for this term pre-eminent siksha guru in the Veda base. But honestly, I couldn't find even one reference where Srila Prabhupada uses this term pre-eminent siksha guru. In case you happen to come across any instance of Srila Prabhupada using the term preeminent shiksha guru, please do share with us and we will be grateful to you for that. Until then, some questions for the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai and its unauthorized gurus and their supporters. If Srila Prabhupada is just a shiksha guru, preeminent or whatever term you want to call it, if Srila Prabhupada is just a shiksha guru for your group, then why have you made it mandatory for all the devotees to sing Sri Guru Vandana prayers for Srila Prabhupada? Which means, line after line, they have to pray to Srila Prabhupada as their diksha guru. And the GBC has said, every day the devotees have to do this. Why has the GBC forbidden the devotees in ISKCON from singing Sri Guru Vandana for their so-called diksha guru's daily and instead the GBC has told them to direct it to Srila

**Key Quote:** "So actually, by the GBC's own rules and laws, Srila Prabhupada is acting as the diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON."
**Summary:** The speaker outlines the functions and characteristics of a Diksha Guru and argues that the GBC's own rules and laws demonstrate that Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling these roles for all ISKCON devotees.

Prabhupada? Isn't this incongruous? Why this confusion? Actually, if we see the functions and characteristics of a diksha guru, what are they? The functions and characteristics of a diksha guru are, number one, he is a shiksha guru. Number two, to give shelter to the disciple by initiating him or her. Number three, to remove all the sinful reactions of the disciple, kuryatpapasesankshayam. Number four, to reveal transcendental knowledge within the heart of the disciple, divyam jnanam yathodadyat. And then, number five, to be the spiritual master for the disciple, life after life, eternally. And number six, to be the spiritual master for the disciple, to act as the manifestation of the mercy of Krishna. All these are functions of the diksha guru. And what does the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group do? They have mandated that all the initiated devotees in ISKCON, irrespective of who their diksha guru is, they should sing daily to Srila Prabhupada all these aspects, which are meant actually for the diksha guru. And simultaneously, they have prohibited the disciples from singing the same thing to their so-called diksha gurus, except for one day in a year. And that too, optionally, not mandated. So actually, by the GBC's own rules and laws, Srila Prabhupada is acting as the diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON. And they are affirming that by singing Sri Guru Vandana for Srila Prabhupada day in and day out. Well, if Srila Prabhupada is performing the diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON, they are performing the all these functions of a diksha guru. Then, what are the unauthorized diksha gurus doing in ISKCON? What are they doing? What are their functions towards their disciples? What are their characteristics? Do they really do anything for their disciples at all? Or do they simply give a mala and a name in a ceremony and that's it? But that is what a Rithvik does, not what a diksha guru does. So, do the unauthorized gurus perform all these functions of a diksha guru? Match anything of what is sung about Srila Prabhupada daily in every ISKCON temple across the world by every ISKCON devotee. No matter who he has taken diksha from, whoever may

**Key Quote:** "The GBC simply said in one line that none of the diksha gurus in ISKCON have any of the characteristics or perform the functions of a diksha guru."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes GBC resolutions regarding the qualifications of Diksha Gurus and concludes that Srila Prabhupada is the only qualified Diksha Guru in ISKCON.

be his diksha guru, he has to sing this Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada. Well, the only thing that the GBC has ever said about its unauthorized gurus is in their resolution 409 of 2004, where they have said, When the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating, it does not thereby endorse him as an uttamaadhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. The GBC simply said in one line that none of the diksha gurus in ISKCON have any of the characteristics or perform the functions of a diksha guru. Whereas, all of those functions and characteristics are attributed to Srila Prabhupada by the GBC by asking all devotees to mandatorily, compulsorily sing Sri Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada daily without fail, irrespective of where they are, whether at temple or at home, you have to sing daily. And the GBC further, in resolution 409 of 2004, has informed all the devotees, saying that, Therefore, each prospective disciple, before initiation, should become familiar with the qualifications mentioned in Srila Prabhupada's books as those that a spiritual master ought to have, and decide for himself which senior devotee, if any, to approach for initiation. Within this context, the choice of whom to select as one's spiritual master is ultimately not that of the GBC. The GBC has also surfaced since the dawn of the GBC's failure to support the practice of possibility within the GBC. All devotees, including those who have not yet ascended into GBC, are gaining the knowledge of GBC and the GBC's that they have not yet attained connections to GBC. They have not yet become very familiar with the GBC or GBC model. Ultimately, the prospective disciple's own responsibility. So, every devotee in the ISKCON Mumbai group, it is your responsibility to determine whether the Diksha Guru in ISKCON is qualified to be a Diksha Guru or not. And well, if you, the devotees in ISKCON Mumbai group were to compare these two statements of the GBC with the position of Srila Prabhupada through the GBC authorized and mandated Sri Guru Vandana, then an intelligent devotee can only conclude that it is Srila Prabhupada alone in ISKCON who is actually the Diksha

**Key Quote:** "So, this aptly fits Prabhupada according to this definition given by Sri Jiva Goswami and Srimad Bhagavatam. And so, Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling these functions and characteristics."
**Summary:** The speaker presents a detailed comparison table, highlighting how Srila Prabhupada fulfills the functions and characteristics of a Diksha Guru, while the unauthorized gurus, according to GBC resolutions, do not.

Guru. Just take a look at this comparison table. Here we have in the first column, the functions and characteristics of Diksha Guru. So, the first point is that Srila Jeevagaswami in Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu says, Diksha Vidhanena Shri Guru Charana Sampaditam, receiving the grace of a bona fide spiritual Master through initiation. And in the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1, Chapter 1, verse 15 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, anyone therefore who takes shelter of the lotus feet of a pure devotee by accepting the pure devotee as his spiritual Master can be at once purified. So, in the Shri Guru Vandana that the devotees have to sing to Prabhupada, what do we sing? Shri Guru Charana Padma Kevala Bhakati Sadma. The lotus feet of the spiritual master are the abode of pure devotional service. So, this aptly fits Prabhupada according to this definition given by Sri Jiva Goswami and Srimad Bhagavatam. And so, Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling these functions and characteristics. And what about the unauthorized gurus as declared by the GBC? The answer is no, they don't perform this function because as per GBC Resolution 409 of 2004, they have declared that none of the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON are pure devotees or Uttama Adhikaris or have achieved any state of specific state of realization. So, they do not fit this characteristic. Then the next one, the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 4, Chapter 29, Verse 55, purport, Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. And as far as Srila Prabhupada is concerned, every devotee has to sing every day, Vandho Mui Savadana Mate, I bow down to those lotus feet with great care and attention. And also, Haha Prabhu Koro Daya Deho More Padachaya. We have to sing to Prabhupada, O Master, be merciful unto me and give me the shade of your lotus feet. So, this condition is fulfilled by Srila Prabhupada. What about this function by the unauthorized Gurus? Well, they give Diksha. This much they do. Then in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 9, Verse 61, purport, It is the spiritual master who delivers the disciple from the clutches of Maya by initiating him into the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. So, how about Prabhupada, according to Sri Guru Vandana, Jahara Prasade Bhai Ebhava Toriyajai Krishna Prapti Hoi Jaha Hoite. It is through the grace of the spiritual master that we cross over this material existence and obtain Krishna. So, Srila Prabhupada fulfils this condition. What about the GBC appointed unauthorized Gurus? It is unclear about whether the Diksha Gurus perform this function or not. Because, some of the people say that it is the Diksha Guru who does it. Some of them say that it is Srila Prabhupada who does it. Some of them say that they don't know who is doing it. Some of them say it is Prabhupada, the Diksha Guru, the Shiksha Guru, the Temple President, the ISKCON as an institution, Prabhupada's books, everything put together who is delivering. So, it is unclear. They don't have a clear stand on this. Moreover, the GBC in their Resolution 409 of 2009, says that the Diksha Guru is the one who does it. So, it is unclear. They don't have a clear stand on this. Moreover, the GBC in their Resolution 409 of 2004 have also stated that none of the Diksha Gurus are pure devotees or Uttama Adhikaris or have achieved any specific state of realization. So, unless they are a pure devotee, they cannot deliver anyone. So, from that perspective, from that Resolution, the unauthorized Gurus in ISKCON are not delivering their disciples.

**Summary:** Continuing the comparison, the speaker emphasizes that Srila Prabhupada provides transcendental knowledge and is the eternal spiritual master, while the unauthorized gurus lack these qualities according to GBC resolutions.

Next in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 15, 108 purport, Srila Jeeva explains Diksha. In his Bhakti Sandarbha, Divyam Janam Yathodadyat, Kuryat Papase Sankshayam, Tasma Diksheti Saproktah, Deshika is Tatva Kovidaihi. Diksha is the process by which one can awaken its transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of revealed scriptures knows this process as Diksha. And to Srila Prabhupada, we have to sing every day, Chakudan Dilojai, He has given me the gift of transcendental vision. And Divya Jnan Hriday Prakashito, by His mercy, divine knowledge is revealed within the heart. So Prabhupada is performing this function as per the GBC. As far as the unauthorized Gurus are concerned, no, they are not doing anything because they are not pure devotees, they are not uttama adhikaris, they have not achieved any specific state of realization as per the GBC Resolution of 409. Next, in the Krishna book, Chapter 80, Prabhupada says, there may be many spiritual masters who instruct. But the initiator spiritual master is one. And so, in the Sri Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada, we sing Janme Janme Prabhu Se, He is my spiritual master life after life. That means Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling this criteria that He is the only spiritual master for us eternally. And as per the GBC Resolution of 409, the spiritual masters are not pure devotees, they are not uttama adhikaris, they have not achieved any specific state of realization, they are silent. So, this is the answer to all the questions that we are getting on whether these unauthorized

**Key Quote:** "That Srila Prabhupada is the sole Diksha Guru for ISKCON."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes that Srila Prabhupada is the sole Diksha Guru for ISKCON, advocating for the implementation of the Ritvik system of initiations and urging devotees to follow Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order.

Diksha Gurus are eternally the Diksha Gurus for their disciples or not. So, it is unclear. When it comes to the next point from the Srimad Bhagavatam, 4th Canto, 21st verse, Chapter 31 purport, as Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions of a person immediately upon his surrender unto Him, similarly, the external manifestation of Krishna, the representative personality of Godhead takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple immediately after the disciple's initiation. And in the Sri Guru Vandana, the devotee has to sing to Srila Prabhupada, Sri Guru Karuna Sindhu, Adama Janara Bandhu. The spiritual master is an ocean of mercy, the friend of the poor. So, Prabhupada is the mercy incarnation of Krishna and it fulfils this criterion. And as far as the GBC is concerned, they have said that the gurus, the diksha gurus in ISKCON are not pure devotees. They don't have any specific state of realization. So, are they taking the sinful reactions of the disciples? It is unclear. They are saying that some of the diksha gurus, they claim that they are taking it. Some of the diksha gurus are claiming it is Prabhupada who takes. Some of them say that how can we burden Srila Prabhupada with the sins of our disciples and all kinds of opinions exist in ISKCON on this front. And so, it is unclear who is taking the sinful reactions of the disciples. So, when we look at this table, there is only one positive thing that the unauthorized diksha gurus in ISKCON are doing. What is it? They are giving diksha. So, apart from giving so-called diksha, what are the diksha gurus in ISKCON doing? There may be 100 plus devotees calling themselves diksha gurus, but none of them perform any of the functions of a diksha guru described in Sri Guru Vandana sung for Srila Prabhupada daily. And nor do any of them fulfill any of the quotes of Srila Prabhupada on diksha guru on initiating guru. So, ultimately, even if you go by these GBC resolutions, an intelligent and well-informed devotee can come to only one conclusion. And what is that? That Srila Prabhupada is the sole Diksha Guru for ISKCON. And that is what Srila Prabhupada too confirmed in the July 9th, 1977 order to all temple presidents and GBCs that he is the spiritual master, he is the Diksha Guru and everybody who takes initiation in ISKCON are his disciples even after his disappearance. So, without getting confused, please follow the July 9th order of Srila Prabhupada implementing the Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON and accept Srila Prabhupada as the sole Diksha Guru in ISKCON through this Ritvik system of initiations and do not be misled by the unauthorized Guru system in ISKCON. Hare Krishna, Vishwa Guru, Srila Prabhupada ki Jai.

**Key Quote:** "The real deeksha or initiation involves a bona fide guru and surrender from the disciple."
**Summary:** The lecture begins by posing questions about the initiations of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Gaukishor Das Babaji Maharaj, setting the stage for a discussion on guru-disciple relationships and the concepts of siksha and diksha in the Vaishnava tradition.

Who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and who initiated Srila Gaukishor Das Babaji Maharaj? In the Vedic culture, the father, the sanyasi, and the brahmana are automatically given the respect and position of a spiritual master. But when such a natural spiritual master turns out to be an atheist like Hiranyakachapu, then he is nothing more than an official guru or a pseudo guru. The real deeksha or initiation involves a bona fide guru and surrender from the disciple. In the ISKCON Mumbai group, their GBC has based their self-appointed guru system on Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur's official acceptance of deeksha from someone who was not an acharya in our parampara. Hare Krishna, Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki jai! Who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur? Was Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj the siksha guru of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur? And who initiated Srila Gaukishor Das Babaji Maharaj? Who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur? Was Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur the siksha guru of Srila Gaukishor Das Babaji Maharaj? These questions may be swirling in the minds of those who happen to hear the claims that our guru parampara is a siksha parampara. That means the acharyas in our sampradaya are primarily of a siksha relationship or deeksha relationship. But what does Srila Prabhupada say about this matter? To know about this, first, let us understand some basic concepts before we hear Srila Prabhupada on...

**Summary:** This segment discusses the concept of a 'natural spiritual master' (father, sanyasi, brahmana) in Vedic culture, contrasting it with the idea of an 'official' or 'pseudo' guru, using the example of Hiranyakashipu to illustrate the dangers of a guru who is an atheist.

In a lecture on the Bhagavad Geeta, chapter two, verses four and five, given on August 5th, 1973, Srila Prabhupada said, So, in the Krishna book in chapter 80, Srila Prabhupada mentions that the father is the natural spiritual master of the child. Similarly, in the Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada mentions, the sanyasi and the brahmana are also natural spiritual masters. What does this mean, natural spiritual master? This means that in the Vedic culture, the father, the sanyasi, and the brahmana are automatically given the respect and position of a spiritual master because they are all expected to play that role of a spiritual master. It is expected that they are qualified as spiritual masters. But when such a natural spiritual master turns out to be an atheist like Hiranyakachapu, then he is nothing more than an official guru or a judo guru. In another lecture on Srimad Bhagavatam, 7th canto, 9th chapter, verse...

**Summary:** This segment focuses on different types of gurus, including 'jnata-guru' (guru by caste) and 'laukika guru' (hereditary guru), emphasizing the importance of accepting a 'paramarthi guru' who is advanced in spiritual knowledge rather than simply following formalities.

we have accepted somebody as guru, but he's a demon. You should be rejected immediately. Just like in India, there is a system of jnata-guru, the guru by car. By family-wise, they become guru. One family is attached to another guru family. By hereditary rules, the sons after sons accepting guru, the other party, and there is regular business. So such kind of guru is not wanted. See, Jīva Gosvāmī has recommended that loki guru, this is loki guru. Parityagela adhyātmik paramārthi guru accepted. Guru has to be accepted who is actually paramārthi, advanced in spiritual knowledge, not the formality. That is seconded by Jīva Gosvāmī. So here, Śrīla Prabhupāda is mentioning another example of an official, or a judo guru, or a laukika guru. A guru who is accepted according to hereditary rules,

**Key Quote:** "However, the hereditary consideration is not acceptable to Vaishnavas."
**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on different types of gurus, including 'caste gurus' and 'hereditary gurus,' highlighting that hereditary considerations are not acceptable in Vaishnavism and that initiation from such gurus is only 'official' and not truly effective.

which are simply material rules. This type of hereditary guru is mentioned by Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Chaitanya Charitāmṛta also. There in the Madhya Līdhā, Chapter 8, verse number 128, purport, Śrīla Prabhupāda says, sometimes a caste guru says, ye kṛṣṇa-tattva-veitāse guru-haya means that one who is not a brāhmaṇa may become a sikṣā-guru or a vartma-pradarśaka-guru, but not an initiator-guru. According to such caste gurus, birth and family ties are considered foremost. However, the hereditary consideration is not acceptable to Vaishnavas. So, from all these statements of Śrīla Prabhupāda, we can see that official gurus or Judo gurus or Lākika gurus or hereditary gurus, spiritual masters accepted according to culture, such as the natural spiritual masters, spiritual masters accepted according to hereditary considerations, those who are born in a certain caste or son of a guru, he automatically becomes a guru, etc. According to caste, etc., these are all not real spiritual masters. And initiation taken from such gurus is only official initiation and is not the real initiation. Such official initiation is not effective. Initiation or dikṣā may become official either if the guru is an official guru or Judo guru or if the disciple is not committed

**Key Quote:** "The official initiation has no meaning. Unless one was fully surrendered to guru, there is no question of initiation."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of surrender in the process of initiation, stating that 'official initiation' is meaningless without full surrender to a bona fide guru, and that real diksha requires both a qualified guru and a surrendered disciple.

to the dikṣā. Śrīla Prabhupāda in a lecture on the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, 1st canto, 2nd chapter, verse number 20, recorded on 24th of July, 1974, says, The official initiation has no meaning. Unless one was fully surrendered to guru, there is no question of initiation. Dibhagyana hṛde prakāśi. Dibhagyana means transcendental knowledge. So, to play tricks with guru, to become diplomat and introvert, to become a guru, to become a leader, these rascals will not help. You can get some other things, some material profit, but spiritual life will be spoiled. This means that the real heart of initiation or dikṣā is surrender by the disciple. Therefore, the real dikṣā or initiation involves a bona fide guru, not an official or Judo guru. And without these two things, the initiation is only official initiation, which is meaningless. Now we have understood what is meant by official guru and official initiation. We have also seen that the surrender of the disciple is what really constitutes initiation.

**Key Quote:** "Śrī Vyāsadevā is the original spiritual preceptor for all men, and all other preceptors are considered to be his representatives."
**Summary:** This segment explores the term 'preceptor' as used by Srila Prabhupada, equating it with 'acharya' and emphasizing the importance of receiving the transcendental message through the bona fide process of hearing from a spiritual master in the guru parampara.

Next, let us look at one more terminology that Śrīla Prabhupāda uses, which is preceptor. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, purport to 1st canto, 1st chapter, verse 5, Śrīla Prabhupāda says, śrī vyāsadevā is the original spiritual preceptor for all men, and all other preceptors are considered to be his representatives. Obviously, here Śrīla Prabhupāda says spiritual preceptor or preceptor to be his representative. It is important to understand this principle. He says, to mean the Acharya or spiritual master like Vyasa Deva. That means someone who is in the Guru Parampara. Again, in Srimad Bhagavatam, purport to Canto 1, chapter 13, verse 15, Srila Prabhupada mentions about Vidura. He was quite competent to occupy the post of an Acharya or spiritual preceptor. Here also, Srila Prabhupada uses the word spiritual preceptor as an equivalent of Acharya. Again, in the purport to Srimad Bhagavatam, 3rd Canto, 19th chapter, 32nd verse, Srila Prabhupada again uses the word preceptor in the same sense of Acharya. So, there Srila Prabhupada says, Thus, he accepted as bona fide. The system of Parampara or receiving the transcendental message in disciplic succession. Unless received by this bona fide process of hearing from a spiritual master, the statement of an Acharya or preceptor cannot be valid. So, like this, in many places, we can see, Srila Prabhupada uses the word preceptor as an equivalent of an Acharya.

**Key Quote:** "So far as your second question, Thakur Bhaktivinoda was not the official spiritual master of Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj."
**Summary:** This segment begins to address the central question of the lecture, quoting a letter from Srila Prabhupada stating that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not the 'official' spiritual master of Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj, but was treated as a preceptor due to his elevated spiritual understanding.

Now, let us come to what Srila Prabhupada says on the matter of initiation of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. In a letter that Srila Prabhupada wrote to Dayananda, written on 1st of May, 1969, Srila Prabhupada says, So far as your second question, Thakur Bhaktivinoda was not the official spiritual master of Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj was already renounced daughter, Paramahamsa. But, Thakur Bhaktivinoda, while he was even playing the part of a householder, was treated by Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj as preceptor, on account of his highly elevated spiritual understanding, and thus, he was always treating him as his spiritual master. The spiritual master is divided into two parts: namely, Shiksha Guru and Diksha Guru. So, officially, Bhaktivinoda Thakur was like Shiksha Guru. He was like the Shiksha Guru of Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. So here, Srila Prabhupada is clearly mentioning that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not the official, please underline, official spiritual master of Shila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. But, officially, again underline, officially, he was like his Shiksha Guru. Like his Shiksha Guru means, he was not actually Shiksha Guru. From official point of view, that means in material point of view or from the point of view of custom or tradition that was prevalent in the society at that time, it appeared like Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was the Shiksha Guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj.

#### Bhaktivinoda Thakur, Gaur Kishore Das Babaji, diksha guru, surrender

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In other words, Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his Diksha Guru."
**Summary:** This segment argues that despite the 'official' designation, Srila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his Diksha Guru, implying that surrender and acceptance are key factors in determining the guru-disciple relationship.

This was only on the official front. But Prabhupada says Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his preceptor, which means spiritual master or acharya, as we have seen how Shaila Prabhupada uses the word preceptor elsewhere, which means a Diksha Guru in the parampara or acharya. In other words, Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his Diksha Guru. So, Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj surrendered to Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, accepting him as his Diksha Guru, treating him as his Diksha Guru. Not only that, Shaila Prabhupada here mentions that spiritual master are of two kinds, Diksha Guru and Shiksha Guru. So, if Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not really the Shiksha Guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj, then, because Prabhupada says officially he was like the Shiksha Guru, that means he was not a Shiksha Guru, but Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj accepted him as his preceptor. Then, what kind of spiritual master was Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur? Obviously, he was not the Shiksha Guru. So, then the only alternative left is that of Diksha Guru. So, Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was the Diksha Guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj, because Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated him like that. He accepted him like that. He surrendered to him like that. In the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Adi Leela, Chapter 1 Summary, Shaila Prabhupada says this, Shaila Vishwanatha Chakravarti Thakur accepted Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji, who initiated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who in turn initiated Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji. So, here, Shaila Prabhupada clearly mentions, unequivocally, that Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur initiated Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj.

**Key Quote:** "Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur initiated Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj."
**Summary:** This segment presents further evidence from Srila Prabhupada's writings, stating unequivocally that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur initiated Srila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj, and that Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur.

In the same vein, Shaila Prabhupada here says that Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj also initiated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. And this is confirmed by Shaila Prabhupada in the March 20, 1960 edition of Back to Godhead, Volume 3, Part 16, where Prabhupada says, Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was initiated and Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Om Vishnupad, Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Prabhupada, the divine spiritual master of our humble self. Again, here also, Shaila Prabhupada says that Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was initiated by Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji. So, from all of this, it is clear that officially or from material point of view, in terms of maybe social custom or tradition or hereditary practices or caste or whatever practices were prevalent in the society at that time, Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj might not have appeared to be the diksha guru of Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. And Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, in turn, might not have appeared to be the diksha guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj in the eyes of the material people.

**Key Quote:** "But from spiritual consideration, Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj was indeed the diksha guru of Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was indeed the diksha guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj."
**Summary:** This segment concludes that while 'official' or 'material' considerations might suggest otherwise, from a spiritual perspective, Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj was the diksha guru of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, and Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was the diksha guru of Srila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj.

But from spiritual consideration, Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj was indeed the diksha guru of Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was indeed the diksha guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. This is the conclusion we can draw. The official Diksha Guru, the Diksha Guru accepted according to hereditary customs or traditions or whatever. The official Diksha Guru of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who may have been accepted in terms of social customs, tradition, hereditary practices, caste or any other material reason, whatever it is. It might have been someone else, not Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj. But for all practical purposes, Srila Prabhupada quotes Srila Jeev Goswami to emphasize that such official Diksha has no relevance, no meaning in spiritual life and therefore such official Diksha Gurus find no mention in the teachings of Srila Prabhupada about who were the official Gurus of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur or of Srila Gaur Keshavar Das Babaji Maharaj, because they are simply not relevant and they have no meaning. So, in fact, Prabhupada says such official Diksha Gurus are to be rejected.

#### ISKCON Mumbai, GBC, official diksha, laukika guru, paramarthika guru, Srila Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "He is the sole Diksha Guru of ISKCON as declared by Srila Prabhupada himself in his July 9th 1977 Directive"
**Summary:** This segment criticizes the ISKCON Mumbai group's guru system, arguing that it is based on a misunderstanding of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur's 'official' acceptance of diksha, and concludes that Srila Prabhupada is the sole Diksha Guru of ISKCON.

As Srila Prabhupada quotes Srila Jeev Goswami, which brings us to the current unauthorized Guru system in the ISKCON Mumbai group. Their GBC has based their self-appointed Guru system on Srila Prabhupada, the Bhaktivinoda Thakur's official acceptance of Diksha from someone who was not an Acharya in our Parampara or who was not a pure devotee. So, the GBC quotes this to justify their stand that the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON need not be pure devotees. But as we have seen until now, such official Diksha Gurus are accepted. The Bhaktivinoda Thakur's official acceptance of Diksha Gurus from someone who was not an Acharya in our Parampara or who was not a pure devotee. So, the GBC quotes this to justify God by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was Laukiki. It was only official and had no spiritual significance, no spiritual meaning. And Srila Prabhupada quoted Srila Jeevakaswami to say that such Laukika Guru is to be rejected. Parityagena. And a Paramarthika Adhyatmika Guru has to be accepted for Diksha. So this means that all of ISKCON Mumbai group's Diksha Gurus who are indicated no objection by the GBC are based on the official or Laukika Diksha Guru example of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur which means as per Srila Jeevakaswami, they are all to be rejected. Parityagena. All the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON are only official or Laukika Gurus. Then who is the Paramarthika Guru? Who is the Paramarthika Guru to be accepted as Diksha Guru in ISKCON? The answer is that is only His Divine Grace Vishwaguru Abhay Charanarvinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. He is the sole Diksha Guru of ISKCON as declared by Srila Prabhupada himself in his July 9th 1977 Directive which is followed by ISKCON Bangalore group.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the GBC's resolution stating that Krishna delivers devotees through various manifestations of His mercy and poses the question of whether this aligns with Srila Prabhupada's teachings.

The GBC of ISKCON Mumbai Group, in its Resolution No. 303, titled GBC Statement on the Position of Srila Prabhupada, has stated that, Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the original Guru, whose divine grace descends through the medium of the Guru Parampara. As such, a devotee is ultimately delivered by Sri Krishna, acting through a combination of various manifestations of His mercy. These include, but are not limited to, the Chaitya Guru, Srila Prabhupada, the Guru Parampara, one's Diksha Guru, other Siksha Gurus, the Holy Name, Shastra and the nine processes of devotional service. So, according to this Resolution of the GBC, who delivers an ISKCON devotee from material entanglement? This is the question before us today. According to the GBC, it is Sri Krishna, acting through a combination of various manifestations of His mercy, such as the Chaitya Guru, Srila Prabhupada, the Guru Parampara, one's Diksha Guru, other Siksha Gurus, the Holy Name, Shastra, Navaveda Bhakti, and many more like this.

**Key Quote:** "The spiritual master is therefore worshipped as one who delivers the disciple from the mire of ignorance with the light of the torch of knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada's purport to Srimad Bhagavatam 3.25.8, emphasizing the role of the spiritual master (Diksha Guru) in delivering the disciple from ignorance and leading them to freedom.

So, we will see, is this statement of the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai Group backed by Srila Prabhupada's teachings and Shastra? Continue listening to find out. In his purport to verse 8 of chapter 25 of the third canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada says, "This verse is very instructive, since it indicates the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple. The disciple or conditioned soul is put into this darkest region of ignorance and therefore is entangled in the material existence of sense gratification. It is very difficult to get out of this entanglement and attain freedom. But if one is fortunate enough to get the association of a spiritual master, like Kapila Muni or his representative, then by his grace, one can be delivered from the mire of ignorance. The spiritual master is therefore worshipped as one who delivers the disciple from the mire of ignorance with the light of the torch of knowledge. The word Paragam is very significant. Paragam refers to one who can take the disciple to the other side. This side is conditioned life. The other side is the life of freedom. The spiritual master takes the disciple to the other side by opening his eyes with knowledge. We are suffering simply because of ignorance. By the instruction of the spiritual master, the darkness of ignorance is removed and thus the disciple is enabled to go to the side of freedom. It is stated in Bhagavad Gita that after many, many births, one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, if after many, many births, one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is able to find a bona fide spiritual master and surrender to such a bona fide representative of Krishna, one can be taken to the side of light." So, well, please note Shaila Prabhupada's opening statement of this purport that these words indicate the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple. These are Prabhupada's words. In other words,

**Key Quote:** "So, very clearly from this purport, we can see that Shaila Prabhupada taught that it is the Diksha Guru who delivers the disciple, not the Siksha Guru or anyone else."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes Srila Prabhupada's purport, highlighting that Prabhupada repeatedly emphasizes the Diksha Guru as the deliverer of the disciple, contrasting it with the GBC's resolution.

these words are specifically about the relationship between the Diksha Guru and his disciple. Therefore, this purport which we have just now gone through is very relevant to our current discussion. And in this purport, Shaila Prabhupada says no less than five times, yes, you heard it right, five times that it is the Diksha Guru who delivers the disciple. The first place, Shaila Prabhupada says, "It is very difficult to get out of this entanglement and attain freedom. But if one is fortunate enough to get the association of a spiritual master like Kapilamani or his representative, then by his grace," whose grace, the spiritual master's grace, "one can be delivered from the mire of ignorance." So, here clearly, Shaila Prabhupada says that the Diksha Guru is the one who delivers the disciple. Then again, Shaila Prabhupada says a second time in the purport, "The spiritual master is therefore worshipped as one who delivers the disciple from the mire of ignorance with the light of the torch of knowledge." Again, Diksha Guru is worshipped as the one who delivers the disciple. Then a third time, Shaila Prabhupada says, "Paragam refers to one who can take the disciple to the other side. This side is conditioned life. The other side is not. The other side is the life of freedom. The spiritual master takes the disciple to the other side by opening his eyes with knowledge." So, that's the third time. As if that were not enough, a fourth time, Shaila Prabhupada says, "By the instruction of the spiritual master, the darkness of ignorance is removed and thus the disciple is enabled to go to the side of freedom." So, it is the instruction of the Diksha Guru that removes the darkness of ignorance. That removes the darkness of ignorance of the disciple, enabling him to achieve freedom. Then, a fifth time, Shaila Prabhupada says in this very purport, "It is stated in Bhagavad Gita that after many, many births, one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, if after many, many births, one is able to find a bona fide spiritual master and surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one is able to surrender to such a bona fide representative of Krishna, one can be taken to the side of light." Only if one gets a bona fide Diksha Guru, can one be taken to the side of light. Let me remind you that Shaila Prabhupada began this purport, how? By saying that this verse is very instructive about the spiritual master and his disciple. Hence, we have to understand that wherever in this purport, Shaila Prabhupada is taking into account the spiritual master, it must refer to Diksha Guru because that is the specific subject of discussion in the verse and the purport. So, very clearly from this purport, we can see that Shaila Prabhupada taught that it is the Diksha Guru who delivers the disciple, not the Siksha Guru or anyone else.

#### Diksha Guru, Holy Name, Deliverance, Responsibility, GBC Resolution Critique

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees
**Key Quote:** "On the other hand, the responsibility of delivering the disciple is taken by the Diksha Guru, solely by the Diksha Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the role of the Holy Name and other devotional practices, stating that the Diksha Guru is the primary deliverer, empowered to engage the disciple in these practices, and criticizes the GBC's resolution for diluting this responsibility.

So, then the question may arise, what is the role of the holy name and all the other items mentioned as the combined deliverers in the GBC resolution like the holy name, the Siksha Gurus, etc. Well, Shaila Prabhupada says this in the purport to the 61st verse of chapter 9 of Madhya Leela in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita. "It is the spiritual master who delivers the disciple from the clutches of Maya by initiating him into the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra." So, we can understand that the deliverer is one. And who is that? The Diksha Guru. To deliver the disciple, the Diksha Guru initiates him into chanting the holy name, performing Navaveda Bhakti, worshipping the Deity, etc. Yes, all these are essential in the deliverance of a conditioned soul. But if we ask, who delivers the devotee? The answer is not that it is Krishna through a combination of Diksha Guru, Siksha Guru, holy name, Navaveda Bhakti, etc. as erroneously resolved by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group. On the other hand, the responsibility of delivering the disciple is taken by the Diksha Guru, solely by the Diksha Guru. We have to understand that everyone's responsibility is nobody's responsibility. The holy name may be there. Krishna may be there. Siksha Gurus may be there. Navaveda Bhakti may be there. Deities may be there. But one person has to take the responsibility of delivering the disciple. It cannot be left to some vague combination of everyone together delivering the devotee. That one person who takes the entire responsibility of delivering the disciple is the Diksha Guru. For delivering the disciple, the Diksha Guru is empowered by Krishna to engage the disciple in worshipping the holy name by chanting a prescribed number of rounds, in worshipping the deity, in executing Navaveda Bhakti, etc. In other words, if one chants the holy name, executes Navaveda Bhakti, hears many Siksha Gurus, but doesn't have a Diksha Guru, then none of them will take responsibility to deliver the devotee. Only when the devotee surrenders unto a bona fide Diksha Guru, will the Diksha Guru take responsibility to deliver the disciple.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees
**Key Quote:** "But, without the grace of a bona fide Diksha Guru, it is impossible to be delivered."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to emphasize the necessity of a bona fide Diksha Guru for deliverance, citing Srimad Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita, and argues that the GBC's resolution diminishes the Diksha Guru's power.

In the Srimad Bhagavatam, canto 4, chapter 24, verses 31 and 32 purport, Srila Prabhupada says this, "When a mantra is chanted by a great devotee, the mantra becomes more powerful. Although the Hare Krishna Mahamantra is powerful in itself, a disciple, upon initiation, receives the mantra from his spiritual master. For, when the mantra is chanted by the spiritual master, it becomes more powerful." So, it is clear that the holy name, Navaveda Bhakti, Shastra, the Guru Parampara, etc. are all acting to deliver the devotee. But, without the grace of a bona fide Diksha Guru, it is impossible to be delivered. Eventually, as Srila Prabhupada said, if a devotee doesn't have a bona fide Diksha Guru, but is chanting the holy name, executing Navaveda Bhakti, etc., then, the Paramatma will guide the devotee to a bona fide Diksha Guru, and then, that bona fide Diksha Guru will take the disciple back to Krishna, back to Godhead, delivering him from the material entanglement. On the other hand, if one has everything, the holy name, Navaveda Bhakti, Shastra, Parampara, etc., but has no bona fide Diksha Guru, then, he cannot be delivered. Srila Prabhupada says, in his purport to the verses 8 through 12 of the 13th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, "Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Krishna, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciples following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation." If the Diksha Guru bestows his blessings upon his disciple, then, the disciple becomes immediately advanced without following any of the regulated principles like Navaveda Bhakti, chanting prescribed number of rounds, etc. That is the power of the bona fide Diksha Guru. And where does the Diksha Guru get such power? From Krishna Himself. Because it is Krishna who has directly empowered the Diksha Guru like that. But, the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group has diluted the power of the Diksha Guru by saying that it is not the Diksha Guru who delivers the disciple. Rather, it is Krishna through many many manifestations of His mercy.

**Key Quote:** "Isn't this statement, isn't this resolution by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group an obfuscation of the truth?"
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the GBC's resolution and questions its validity in light of Srila Prabhupada's teachings, suggesting it might be a way for the GBC to reconcile differing opinions or to compensate for a lack of faith in their own Diksha Gurus.

Let us go through that resolution once again. What does the resolution say? It says, "As such, a devotee is ultimately delivered by Sri Krishna acting through a combination of various manifestations of His mercy. These include, but are not limited to, the Chaitya Guru, Srila Prabhupada, the Guru Parampara, one's Diksha Guru, other Siksha Gurus, the Holy Name, Shastra, and the nine processes of devotional service." Do you see how ridiculous this resolution is when you look at all of Srila Prabhupada's instructions on this matter? This is a whole new spin that the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group is giving to the process of deliverance of a disciple by a bona fide Diksha Guru. Isn't this statement, isn't this resolution by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group an obfuscation of the truth? Isn't the GBC contorting the truth to suit its own self-centred agenda? Has the GBC passed such a ridiculous resolution which contradicts Srila Prabhupada's teachings because the GBC believes that its Diksha Gurus are not bona fide, that they are unauthorised. And because they are unauthorised, the ISKCON Gurus are not empowered by Krishna to deliver their disciples. Is it because the GBC knows that the ISKCON Diksha Gurus are not really performing the role of Diksha Guru, which is to illuminate the disciple's heart with transcendental knowledge and to deliver him from all sinful reactions, which is the definition of Diksha Vedana, or in other words, to deliver the disciple from the material world, just as Srila Prabhupada quoted Srila Jeeva Goswami in Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Madhya Leela, chapter 15, verse 108 purport?

#### GBC Resolution Critique, Hypocrisy, Srila Prabhupada, Diksha Guru, Deliverance

**Key Quote:** "The deliverer in our group is His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, who delivers all the devotees in our group, because He is our sole bona fide Diksha Guru, empowered directly by Krishna to be the deliverer."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to critique the GBC's resolution, questioning its consistency and suggesting it might be hypocritical. He contrasts this with his own group's belief that Srila Prabhupada is the sole deliverer.

Is this resolution an attempt by the GBC to reconcile the different opinions that exist in ISKCON as to who delivers the devotees? Do all the Gurus and their disciples in ISKCON agree and accept the GBC's version of who delivers the disciple? Very unlikely, because there are many, many divided opinions amongst the Gurus and their disciples in ISKCON on this subject. Everyone in ISKCON has his own opinion as to who delivers the disciples. Somebody says Krishna delivers, somebody says Prabhupada delivers, somebody says the Diksha Guru delivers, etc. Does this resolution number 303 of the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group not smack of hypocrisy, calling its devotees Diksha Gurus, but openly declaring that they are incapable of delivering their disciples? On the one hand, the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group accuses Srila Prabhupada's Rithvik system of initiations of making Srila Prabhupada impotent. But on the other hand, what does this resolution 303 of 2014 speak of the potency of the ISKCON unauthorized Gurus? Are the unauthorized Diksha Gurus in ISKCON not potent enough to deliver their disciples? We are not sure if the GBC has any answers at all to these questions, as well as the innumerable questions we have raised on the unauthorized Guru system in all our videos till date. Their deafening silence can mean only one thing. What is that? That they have no answer to any of our questions. As far as we at Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group are concerned, you can ask any devotee in our group. Write from a newly joined Bhakta to the senior most GBC in our group, as to who delivers the devotees in our group. You will instantly get one and only one spontaneous and unambiguous answer everywhere without fail, without any confusion, without any doubt. What is that answer? The deliverer in our group is His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, who delivers all the devotees in our group, because He is our sole bona fide Diksha Guru, empowered directly by Krishna to be the deliverer. Hare Krishna Vishwaguru

**Summary:** The speaker shares his personal experience of arriving in Vrindavan during winter and being shocked by the cold.

But you know, I have also been, you know, I was born and grew up in South India. So, when I went to Vrindavan, I went in 2005. So, and unfortunately, I went in February. You know, January, February is the coldest season in Vrindavan. So, I had no idea how winter is in North India. I never went out of South India. You know, Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, these were the areas which I used to roam, until I was, until I joined the temple and then went to Vrindavan. So, I had no idea how winters are in the North India. Maximum winter, I had got exposed to was in Bangalore, you know. Maximum would go down to 20 degrees, 22 degrees. And in Vrindavan, you know how winters are. The maximum, the maximum daytime temperature at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the afternoon will be around 5 degrees or 6 degrees. That's the kind of winter. So, I had no idea. So, you know, we got into a car from the airport and drove down to Vrindavan. And our Vrindavan Chandra Uday Mandir site that is there. At that time, of course, it's not like this currently. It was just plain land. There was absolutely nothing. The torus which you see now, it was still coming up. So, I went and landed there. Got out of the car. As soon as I got out of the car, I immediately got back inside. There was a very cold... As it is, the temperature was cold. On top of that, a cold breeze was blowing. The moment it touched my skin, that's all. I couldn't get out of the car. I immediately jumped back inside the car. I said, I am not going to get out. Then, you know, with me, other Vyopat Prabhu and other devotees were there. They said, hey, if you don't get out, you look very bad. I see all the embassies, they are standing there. Come on, get out. So, with great difficulty, I managed to get out.

So, there are breezes also which are not pleasant. So, sometimes, you know, in the extreme winter, when the breeze blows, it is not pleasing.

Summer also, I had never experienced, you know, in Bangalore, temperatures those days, maximum 28, 29. 30 was unheard of in Bangalore, those days. Nowadays, of course, it goes to 35, 36 and all that.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that natural disturbances are a result of humanity going against Krishna's will and exploiting material nature, disrupting the balance of the universe.

So, which is what we are experiencing now. Every other day, there is a cyclone. Recently, just recently, you know, Chennai has gone through one cyclone, still not got over the, still the cyclone hangover is still going on, still continuously raining. And few years back, we had the big tsunami. And I think couple of years back, we had a big flood also here. So, these kind of natural disturbances are actually, if you see, they are not meant to be in this world. It is not that this world is like this. No, this world is not like this, not supposed to be like this. This world, Krishna has created in such a way, that it is supposed to be very pleasing and giving lot of peace and comfort to us in our minds, as long as we are executing spiritual activities. The moment we go against the will of Krishna, we go against the laws of nature, we start trying to exploit, material nature as well as other living entities. When that becomes prominent in this material world, what happens is, all the entire system around which this whole material universe is designed, gets disrupted. And when that gets disrupted,

### 🎓 SIKSHA PARAMPARA vs. RTVIK DIKSHA 🔥 | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "To clear the air of the confusion created by this argument, we need to first understand that there are two separate and unrelated processes being compared here."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the central argument against the Rithvik system, focusing on the distinction between Diksha and Siksha Parampara and the role of the GBC in ISKCON.

An Acharya has to be self-realized, he has to be liberated, and he must be an Uttama Adhikari Paramahamsa Vaishnava. Nowhere in his entire teachings does Srila Prabhupada talk about a person called Vipin Bihari Goswami. Srila Prabhupada never referred to our parampara as Diksha Parampara or Siksha Parampara. Mention of a possibility does not constitute an order. All the Gurus in the Guru Parampara are pure devotees. The capability to take the disciple back to Godhead—he should not give initiation. The GBC's concoction is playing havoc with the society and the lives of innocent devotees. The GBC has the audacity to change Prabhupada's books, to contradict him, to find fault with Prabhupada's words. Not a single shred of evidence that Srila Prabhupada ordered Gurus to be nominated with a no objection indicated by the GBC point. Hare Krishna! Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki Jai! One of the arguments presented against the Rithvik system of initiations which has been instituted in ISKCON by Srila Prabhupada is that our Guru Parampara is a Siksha Parampara. It is not a Diksha Parampara. The oft-quoted example is that of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. It is said that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur took Diksha from one Bipin Bihari Goswami. But this Bipin Bihari Goswami is not an Acharya in the Madhavagodiyas of Vaishnava Sampradaya. There are other such examples too. Hence, those Vaishnavas in good standing, who are not Acharyas in the Guru Parampara, who may not be Uttama Adhikari, Paramahamsa Vaishnavas, can give Diksha, like Bipin Bihari Goswami, who is not part of the Guru Parampara. This argument is put forward by the supporters of the self-appointed, unauthorized Guru system in ISKCON. They put forward this argument to justify their GBC's unauthorized, no-objection indication of unqualified devotees as Diksha Gurus in ISKCON. To clear the air of the confusion created by this argument, we need to first understand

#### Acharya, Guru Parampara, Designation, Authorization

**Key Quote:** "A Guru can become Guru when he is ordered by his Guru. That's all. Otherwise, nobody can become Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the process of appointing an Acharya in the Guru Parampara, emphasizing the importance of authorization and designation by the predecessor Guru, using quotes from Srila Prabhupada.

that there are two separate and unrelated processes being compared here. The first process is that of the appointment of an Acharya to the Guru Parampara. An Acharya has to be self-realized, he has to be liberated, and he must be an Uttama Adhikari, Paramahamsa Vaishnava. Such an elevated Paramahamsa, chosen by Krishna Himself to represent Him, is identified by the predecessor Acharya and appointed as the next Acharya. For example, in this conversation, an Indian man asked Srila Prabhupada, "When did you become the spiritual leader of Krishna Consciousness?" Srila Prabhupada replied, "What is that?" Brahmananda clarified, "He is asking, When did you become the spiritual leader of Krishna Consciousness?" Srila Prabhupada immediately replied, "When my Guru Maharaj ordered me." This is Guru Parampara. The Indian man is still pursuing his question. "Did it?" Srila Prabhupada tried to understand. "Don't go very speedily. A Guru can become Guru when he is ordered by his Guru. That's all. Otherwise, nobody can become Guru." In another quote, in the Srimad Bhagavatam, Prabhupada says, "One should take initiation from a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession, who is authorized by his predecessor spiritual master. This is called Diksha Vidhana." And yet, in another room conversation in San Diego, recorded on June 29, 1972, in this conversation, Atre Rishi asked Prabhupada, "How many qualifications does a spiritual master have in terms of being a spiritual master?" And Prabhupada replied, "One qualification. He is a devotee of God. That's all." Atre Rishi continued, "Also, is he designated? Does he have to be designated by the former spiritual master?" Prabhupada immediately, "Oh yes! Oh yes!" So, Atre Rishi, he has to be a devotee. He has to be both surrendered and designated. That is, identifies disciplic succession, both surrender and designation. And in another lecture on the Nectar of Devotion, Srila Prabhupada said this, "Similarly, bona fide Guru means, he must be authorized by the superior Guru. Just like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, Amarajnaya Guruhaya Tare Desha He must receive the order from superior. And the superior must be bona fide. Then he is bona fide, not self-made."

#### Guru Parampara, Initiation, Bhaktivinoda Thakur, ISKCON Mumbai

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Successor Acharya need not be necessarily initiated by the predecessor Acharya."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the argument that Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not initiated by his predecessor, clarifying that direct initiation is not always necessary for being part of the Guru Parampara, and criticizing ISKCON Mumbai's interpretation.

So, from this, what we have to note is, Successor Acharya need not be necessarily initiated by the predecessor Acharya. Although, there is no rule that prevents such an event happening. For example, Srila Prabhupada was initiated by his predecessor Acharya, His Divine Grace Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. And Srila Prabhupada was chosen by him to be the next Acharya. On the other hand, this is the argument given by the self-appointed Guru Saraswati. The supporters, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Gaurakeshwar Das Babaji Maharaj were not initiated by their respective predecessor Acharyas. This is the claim of the supporters of the self-appointed Guru system in ISKCON. How far their claim is true is debatable. Because, Srila Prabhupada in the Chaitanya Charitamrita Adi Leela Chapter 1 Summary says, "Srila Viswanatha Chakravarti Thakur accepted Srila Jagannath Das Babaji, who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who in turn initiated Srila Gaurakeshwar Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Om Vishnupada, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, the divine master of our humble self." So, although ISKCON Mumbai's group claims that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not initiated by Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada says that Bhaktivinoda Thakur was initiated by Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj. Nowhere in his entire teachings does Srila Prabhupada talk about a person called Bipin Bihari Goswami. So, just to justify their self-authorized Guru system, the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group is finding fault with Srila Prabhupada himself and blatantly contradicts Srila Prabhupada. Be that as it may, the fact is that in a Guru Parampara, the Acharya ordered by the predecessor Acharya need not be initiated by him.

#### Disciplic Succession, Diksha, Siksha, Possibility vs. Order

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Mention of a possibility does not constitute an order."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes Srila Prabhupada's letter to Kirtananda, arguing that disciplic succession doesn't require direct discipleship and that Prabhupada's statements about future disciples do not constitute an order to initiate.

Here is what Srila Prabhupada says in this letter to Kirtananda written on 25th of January 1969. "Another point is that disciplic succession does not mean one has to be directly a disciple of a particular person." So, without taking shelter of the Bipin Bihari Goswami argument, we see that Srila Prabhupada in 1969 itself said that disciplic succession doesn't necessarily mean one has to be a direct disciple of the predecessor spiritual master. So, does that mean that ours is a Siksha Parampara? Well, Srila Prabhupada never referred to our Parampara as Diksha Parampara or Siksha Parampara. These are concoctions of the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group just to confuse the devotees and make them think that their self-appointed Guru system is authorized. Srila Prabhupada always referred to our Parampara as Guru Parampara or disciplic succession. So, let us stick to Srila Prabhupada's terminology. That's safe. But still, does that mean that taking Diksha from a Guru who is not a pure devotee is alright? Well, in the same letter to Kirtananda on 25th of January 1969, Srila Prabhupada elaborates this. "Regarding your question about the disciplic succession coming down from Arjuna, it is just like I have got my disciples. So, in the future, these many disciples may have many branches of disciplic succession." Now, here, let me clarify. Prabhupada is talking about a possibility. So, talking about a possibility is not an order. So, this sentence, this statement by Prabhupada that just like I have got my disciples, so in future, these many disciples may have many branches of disciplic succession, does not mean that they have to initiate on their own. For example, the Prime Minister of India may say, "There is a possibility of war with Pakistan." Does that mean that the army chief immediately says, "Oh, Prime Minister said that there is a possibility of war. So, immediately go out and attack Pakistan." No, mention of a possibility does not constitute an order. So, Prabhupada here is just mentioning a possibility. It may be possible. So, this does not constitute an order.

#### Disciplic Succession, Arjuna, Vyasadeva, Pure Devotee

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All the Gurus in the Guru Parampara are pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker continues analyzing Srila Prabhupada's letter, using the example of Arjuna and Vyasadeva to illustrate that even without direct initiation, one can be an Acharya if connected to the disciplic succession through pure devotees.

So, Prabhupada further goes on to say, "So, in one line of disciples, we may not say another name coming from a different line. But this does not mean that person whose name does not appear was not in the disciplic succession. Narada was the spiritual master of Vyasadeva and Arjuna was Vyasadeva's disciple, not as initiated disciple, but there was some blood relation between them. So, there is connection in this way. And it is not possible to list all such relationships in the short description given in Bhagavad Gita as it is. Another point is that disciplic succession does not mean one has to be directly a disciple of a particular person. The conclusions which we have tried to explain in our Bhagavad Gita As It Is, is the same as those conclusions of Arjuna. Arjuna accepted Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and we also accept the same truth under the disciplic succession of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Things equal to the same thing are equal to one another. This is an axiomatic truth. So, there is no difference of opinion of understanding Krishna between ourselves and Arjuna. Another example is that a tree has many branches and you will find one leaf here and another leaf there. But if you take this leaf and the other leaf and you press them both, you will see that the taste is the same. The taste is the conclusion and from the taste, you can understand that both leaves are from the same tree." So, this example given in this letter by Srila Prabhupada is that of Arjuna and Vyasa Deva. Arjuna might not be the initiated disciple of Vyasa Deva, but still, he could also be an Acharya. Now, does that mean Arjuna was initiated by someone who was not a pure devotee? Definitely not. Because Srila Prabhupada gives the example of two leaves from the same tree, meaning that, one devotee may be initiated by a pure devotee coming down from one branch, while the predecessor Guru might be coming down from another branch. The predecessor Guru might order this devotee who is initiated from a different branch to become the next Guru in his line. So, both are initiated by pure devotees. Both are pure devotees themselves. In that way, the Guru in the Guru Parampara may not be initiated directly by the predecessor Guru, but he still is initiated by a pure devotee in some other line. Therefore, all leaves taste the same. Meaning, all the Gurus in the Guru Parampara are pure devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The only way a conditioned soul can get connected to the Guru Parampara is the process of Diksha."
**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes between the process of appointing a Guru and the process of a conditioned soul receiving Diksha, emphasizing that Diksha must be taken from an Acharya in the Guru Parampara for liberation.

So, the criterion for appointment to the Guru Parampara as the next Acharya or Diksha Guru is not Diksha by the predecessor Acharya or Siksha, but rather, order by the predecessor Acharya, as we have seen from the previous quotes of Srila Prabhupada which we shared in the beginning. So, this is the process of appointing the Guru. Now, we come to the second process. The second process is separate and unrelated from the above process. What was the above process? The first process is the process of appointing a Guru by the predecessor Guru. So, this is the first process. Now, the second process which is separate and unrelated to this process of appointment of a Guru by the predecessor Guru is that of the deliverance of a conditioned soul. The process of deliverance of a conditioned soul happens by the combination of revelation of transcendental knowledge in his heart and the destruction of all accumulated past sinful reaction. This process, as all of you know, is called Diksha: Divyam Jnanam Yathodadhyat and Kuryat Papasya Sankshayam. For a conditioned soul to obtain Diksha requires that he must search out an Uttamaadhikari, Paramahamsa Acharya who is part of the Guru Parampara and the devotee has to surrender to him and take Diksha from him. Such a conditioned soul cannot be delivered back to Godhead without taking Diksha from a Paramahamsa Acharya of the Guru Parampara. The only way a conditioned soul can get connected to the Guru Parampara is the process of Diksha. So, Srila Prabhupada mentions in this, "If you do not take your initiation from the Sampradaya, then it is useless. Now, there are so many Appa Sampradaya. They do not come in discipling succession but becomes Guru, teacher. Therefore, everything is topsy-turvy. Nobody has got fixed idea what is God. Everyone has created his own philosophy. The whole thing is now confused." So, as we can see in the above quote, initiation must be taken from the Sampradaya. That means the Guru who gives the initiation must be a person who is part of the Sampradaya or who is in the Sampradaya or Guru Parampara.

**Key Quote:** "Guru is not manufactured. Guru is in the discipling succession."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the importance of a Guru being in the disciplic succession and authorized by his predecessor, emphasizing that a Guru must be bona fide and capable of taking the disciple back to Godhead.

Now, in another quote Prabhupada says, "Otherwise one becomes Guru. Anyone, just like nowadays they become, they are manufacturing Guru. Guru is not manufactured. Guru is in the discipling succession. Guru is in the discipling succession. One who strictly follows the footsteps of the Shadgo Swamis." This is from the lecture in the Srimad Bhagavatam. In another place, Prabhupada says, "Our Guru or spiritual master comes down from that discipling succession. It is not that, that somebody all of a sudden becomes Guru and manufactures his own philosophy. We don't accept such nonsense. We must accept somebody who is actually bona fide coming in discipling succession, not others." And yet another place, Prabhupada says, "One should take initiation from a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession who is authorized by his predecessor spiritual master. This is called Diksha Vidhana." So, in this last quote, Prabhupada makes it clear that Guru is in the discipling succession. And in other places, Prabhupada says, the Guru comes down from that discipling succession. In the discipling succession or from the discipling succession means that the Guru has to be one of the 32 personalities mentioned in the Guru Parampara. It cannot be otherwise. Diksha taken from such a Guru results in taking the disciple back to Godhead. So, Prabhupada says in the Srimad Bhagavatam, "According to Shastra, the duty of the Guru is to take the disciple back to Godhead. If he is unable to do so and instead hinders the disciple in going back to Godhead, he should not be a Guru." In other words, from this quote, unless the Guru has the capability to take the disciple back to Godhead, he should not give initiation.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "No one can become Guru in ISKCON without the specific order of Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that the processes of appointing a Guru and a disciple are separate, and criticizes the ISKCON Mumbai GBC's self-appointed Guru system, arguing that it could lead to bringing in unqualified Gurus from outside ISKCON.

Thus, we can clearly see that one process of liberation for a conditioned soul involves Diksha from an Acharya in the Guru Parampara, while the other process of appointment of a successor Acharya does not necessarily involve Diksha. Both processes are unrelated. One is the process of appointment of a Guru and the other is the appointment of a disciple. Both are separate, independent and cannot be compared. We cannot apply the principles of appointment of a Guru to those of the appointment of a disciple or vice versa. Hence, irrespective of whether our Parampara is Diksha Parampara or Shiksha Parampara, no one can become Guru in ISKCON without the specific order of Srila Prabhupada. And such a Diksha Guru must necessarily be a pure devotee, thirty-third in the Parampara. And as we all know, Srila Prabhupada never ordered anyone to become Diksha Guru. Hence, we have to follow the order of Srila Prabhupada given in the July 9th, 1977 Diksha Parampara. And this directive is to be followed in ISKCON to avoid the violation of the principles of Vaishnava Siddhanta. Now, one more important point we must remember is that if we were to accept the argument of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur being appointed by Bipin Bihari Goswami, then the question arises that why should the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group limit the Diksha Gurus to only disciples of Srila Prabhupada, or the disciples of their self-appointed Gurus? Bipin Bihari Goswami was not in the Parampara. So, someone can argue that we can bring in Vaishnavas or devotees from outside ISKCON and declare him also to be a Diksha Guru in ISKCON. Why limit it to only devotees within ISKCON?

#### GBC, ISKCON Mumbai, Book Changes, Spiritual Lives

**Key Quote:** "The GBC has the audacity to change Prabhupada's books, to contradict him, to find fault with Prabhupada's words."
**Summary:** The speaker accuses the ISKCON Mumbai GBC of creating a self-appointed Guru system without scriptural basis, contradicting Srila Prabhupada, and even changing his books to fit their agenda, leading to the destruction of innocent devotees' spiritual lives.

So, we can see that their argument to justify their self-appointed Guru system can only create more problems in the ISKCON. The GBC of ISKCON Mumbai has created this self-appointed Guru system out of thin air without any reference to Sadhu, Shastra or Guru. They have contradicted Srila Prabhupada and in some cases even changed Srila Prabhupada's instructions to fit their concocted no-objection Guru system. Actually, if you want a proof of this, in the original Chaitanya Charita Amrita Adi Leela Chapter 1 Summary, Srila Prabhupada said this, which we mentioned at the beginning of this discussion. "Srila Vishwanatha Chakravarthi Thakur accepted Srila Jagannath Das Babaji, who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who in turn initiated Srila Gaurakeshwar Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Om Vishnupada, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, the divine master of our humble self." So, this did not fit into their self-appointed no-objection Guru system. So, what did they do? They changed Prabhupada's books to "Srila Vishwanatha Chakravarthi Thakur accepted Srila Jagannath Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who in turn accepted," replaced the word initiated with accepted, "Srila Gaurakeshwar Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Om Vishnupada, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, the divine master of our humble self." So, we can see how the GBC's concoction is playing havoc with the society and the lives of innocent devotees. The GBC has the audacity to change Prabhupada's books, to contradict him, to find fault with Prabhupada's words. And because of their actions, so many innocent devotees' spiritual lives have been destroyed, because this GBC thrust upon them, without their consent or knowledge, a neophyte devotee as their Diksha Guru. And subsequently, when the neophyte Guru fell down, thousands of devotees who were initiated by him had to suffer spiritual, mental and emotional trauma and agony.

#### Guru, Krishna Consciousness, Uttamaadhikari, Rithvik System

**Key Quote:** "One who has understood Krishna as the supreme controller... then he can become Guru. Otherwise, don't try to become Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada on the qualifications of a Guru, emphasizing the need for full understanding of Krishna and criticizing those who become Gurus without proper qualification, ultimately advocating for the Rithvik system.

Srila Prabhupada said in a lecture, "Therefore, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu confirms, Ae Krishna Tattva Veta Sai Guru Haya One who has understood Krishna as the supreme controller, the supreme person, the supreme maintainer, and everything, the supreme ultimate, then he can become Guru. Otherwise, don't try to become Guru. Impersonalist, half understood, partially understood, he cannot become Guru. This is the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's formula. Therefore, first of all, try to understand Krishna. You will understand in such a way that you can refute all others' argument, all others' opposition. There are so many opposing elements. Then you are Guru. Otherwise, you cannot become a Guru. Guru is not so tiny thing or trifle thing that everyone becomes Guru Maharaj. No, that is not Guru. Samahatma Vasudevaha Sarvamiti Samahatma Sudurlabha" So, you heard what Prabhupada said. Half understood, partially understood, he cannot become Guru. Only an Uttamaadhikari Guru in the Guru Parampara can claim to know full and not partial. Conditioned souls cannot know fully. They can only know partially. In other words, conditioned souls cannot become Guru. To become a Guru and to give Diksha is not a trifle thing. It is an extremely serious affair because Guru has to take the disciple back to Godhead. So, there is not a single shred of evidence that Srila Prabhupada ordered Gurus to be nominated with a no objection indicated by the GBC body. How long will the GBC stubbornly refuse to accept the truth and keep coming up with various concoctions just to fulfill their megalomaniacal ambition to become Diksha Guru? How long will the GBC continue to slaughter innocent devotees' spiritual lives to quench their thirst for honour, prestige and worship? Without a direct order from Srila Prabhupada, ISKCON's self-appointed no objection Gurus are not in the Guru Parampara. Thus, the Guru nomination system of ISKCON is unauthorized, while the Rithvik system authorized by Srila Prabhupada in writing via the July 9, 1977 Directive, fulfills all the conditions stipulated for a devotee to take initiation from a Mahabhagavata in the Guru Parampara and go back to Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by urging devotees to reject the self-appointed Guru system of ISKCON Mumbai and to take shelter of the Rithvik system ordered by Srila Prabhupada, as followed by the GBC of ISKCON Bangalore.

The Rithvik process is independent of whether the Guru Parampara is Siksha or Diksha Parampara. Whether the Guru Parampara is Siksha or Diksha Parampara, has no relevance to the process of taking Diksha from Srila Prabhupada via the Rithvik system personally instituted in ISKCON by Srila Prabhupada. Thus, the Rithvik system does not violate any principle, even if our Guru Parampara is considered to be based on Siksha and not Diksha. All devotees are requested to reject the self-appointed no objection Guru system promoted by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai. Instead, please take shelter of the Rithvik system ordered by Srila Prabhupada on July 9, 1977 and followed by the GBC of ISKCON Bangalore.

He accepts various transcendental bodies among all types of living entities, and among human beings he especially appears as Lord Krishna and Lord Rama. By his causeless mercy he protects the demigods, who are always harassed by the demons. He is the supreme worshipable deity of all living entities. He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. All the different from this universe, he exists in his universal form, Virata Rupa. In our fearful condition, let us take shelter of him, for we are sure that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Soul, will give us his protection.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, the Supreme Lord is the cause of Prakriti and Purusha. He is the original cause, Sarvakarana Karanam."
**Summary:** The speaker reads and explains the purport, emphasizing Vishnu as the original cause of creation, Prakriti, and Purusha, referencing Sridhar Swami's commentary and various scriptures.

Purport. In this verse, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu, is ascertained to be the original cause of creation. Sridhar Swami, in his commentary, Bhavarth Deepika, replies to the idea that Prakriti and Purusha are the causes of the cosmic manifestation. As stated here in Param Pradhanam Purusham Vishvamanyam, he is the Supreme. He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. All the different from this universe, he exists in his universal form, Virata Rupa. The word Prakriti, which is used to indicate the source of generation, refers to the material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word Purusha refers to the living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord. Both the Prakriti and Purusha ultimately enter the Supreme Lord, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, Prakritim Yanti Maam Ikam. Although Prakriti and Purusha superficially appear to be the causes of the material creation, both are emanations of different energies of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the Supreme Lord is the cause of Prakriti and Purusha. He is the original cause, Sarvakarana Karanam. The Naradya Purana, Avikaropi Paramah Prakritistu Vikarini Anupravisya Govindah Prakritishchabhidhiyate Both the Prakriti and Purusha, which are inferior and superior energies, are emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained in the Bhagavad Gita, Gama Vishya The Lord enters the Prakriti and then the Prakriti, and creates different manifestations. The Prakriti is not independent or beyond his energies. Vasudeva, Lord Shri Krishna, is the original cause of everything. Therefore, the Lord says in the Bhagavad Gita, Aham Sarvasya Prabhavo Matta Sarvam Pravartate Iti Matva Bhajante Maam Buddha Bhava Saman Vitaha I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from me. The wise, who perfectly know this, engage in my devotional service and worship me with all their hearts. In Srimad Bhagavatam, the Lord also says, Aham Evasam Evagre Only I existed before the creation. This is confirmed in the Brahmanda Purana as follows: Smritir Avya Vadhanena Prakrititvam Iti Sthithi Ubhayatmaka Suthitvadha Vasudeva Parah Puman Prakriti Purushad Cheti Shabder Ekobhidhiyate To generate the universe, the Lord acts indirectly as the Purusha and directly as the Prakriti. The energies emanate from Lord Vasudeva, the all-pervasive, supreme personality of Godhead. He is known as both Prakriti and Purusha. Therefore, Vasudeva is the cause of everything.

#### Vritrasura, Indra, yagna, mantra, fear, shelter

**Key Quote:** "So now Indra and all the devatas are seeing this personality and they have no clue from where he has appeared and how he has appeared and they all become very very afraid and now they have taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for protection"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Vritrasura's appearance and Indra's fear, explaining how a mistake in chanting a mantra led to an unintended outcome, and how the demigods sought protection from the Supreme Lord.

So in this chapter, chapter 9 of 6th canto, the appearance of demon Vritrasura. So we know the story how the demon appeared. Indra, he killed his priest because he was chanting the mantras favoring the demons. So Indra becomes very afraid and kills him. And then his father becomes upset because his son is killed. So his father, Tvashta, is performing a sacrifice by which a personality will be born who will kill Indra, because Indra killed his son, that is Visvarupa. So Visvarupa was the priest that Indra had engaged and he killed his own priest because he was favoring the demons. So Tvashta, his father, performs a yagna. And as we read that in the yagna, this is the importance of chanting the Vedic mantras accurately. He chanted the mantra Indra Shatro Vibhar Dasva. And he was supposed to chant it short, but he chanted it long. And because of this small difference of chanting it short to long, the mantra became opposite. Tvashta, when he chanted the mantra Indra Shatro Vibhar Dasva, Indra Shatro means the Shatru of Indra Vibhar Dasva may increase. So from the yagna a personality would be born who would be a Shatru of Indra, who would be the enemy of Indra. But because he chanted it long instead of chanting it short, the meaning became opposite. The meaning became Indra will become the Shatru of that personality. So now somebody asked me what's the difference whether he becomes the Shatru of him or Indra becomes the Shatru of him, what is the difference? They did not understand this. Quite a reasonable question. So it is like this: Personality and Indra. If this personality Tvashta wanted to be the enemy of Indra, then he will kill him because he is the enemy. So the personality was supposed to be born as enemy of Indra means he would kill Indra because he is the enemy. But now what happened? Indra became his enemy. So now because Indra has become his enemy, Indra will kill him. So you see how the meaning has changed. Instead of he killing Indra, he becoming so powerful that he would kill Indra, Indra got all the power by that Yagna and Indra finally killed him, Vritrasura. That's why Vritrasura was such a powerful demon. It is said that when Vritrasura appeared he was so fearful and so huge and gigantic that the demigods felt that the entire creation would be destroyed. Not just the universe, the entire creation. But Indra managed to kill him because the Yagna was performed like that. So Vritrasura has appeared. So now Indra and all the devatas are seeing this personality and they have no clue from where he has appeared and how he has appeared and they all become very very afraid and now they have taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for protection. So this is the Mantra. So in this shloka this is the prayer of Indra to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Narayana. They are offering prayers seeking protection, seeking shelter from Lord Narayana. So here in this prayer we read this prayer how Krishna is the cause of all causes. He is the cause of Purusha. He is the cause of Prakriti. Purusha is the superior living entity, the spirit soul and the ultimate paramam Purusha is Krishna and Prakriti is this material manifestation. So all that we see in this material world is a combination of Purusha and Prakriti because we are also small Purushas. So the origin of Purusha and Prakriti is the Supreme Lord. Like that the prayer starts off and then Indra is praying to the Lord. So how do you begin a prayer? You start glorifying the Supreme Lord. So Indra is glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Narayana.

**Key Quote:** "My dear Lord, O Lord Narayana, You are inconceivable"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Indra's prayer to Lord Narayana, highlighting the Lord's inconceivable nature, His expansions into various incarnations, and His position as the cause of all causes.

Indra says that My dear Lord, O Lord Narayana, You are inconceivable. So we try to understand God, but actually God can be understood only by Bhakti. God cannot be understood by our material logic, by our material intelligence. That's why Indra is saying You are inconceivable. And so Krishna's name is Achintya. He cannot be understood. That's why he is inconceivable. Krishna's another name to explain how he is inconceivable is Adhokshaja. Akshaja means these senses. Akshaja means the eyes. It also refers to all the senses, the five senses that we have to acquire knowledge. But Krishna's Adhokshaja means he is beyond these five senses. So he is inconceivable. Because we can only conceive something which is within our intellect, which we can understand through our senses, eyes, ears, nose and all those five senses. But Krishna is beyond them. That's why he is inconceivable. And that's why Krishna is called Adhokshaja. So Indra is praying You are inconceivable. All the pastimes of Krishna are also inconceivable. So many wonderful pastimes Krishna performed. These are the inconceivable pastimes of Lord. And then he also says that Indra is praying that you expand yourself into different transcendental bodies. All the list of incarnations are mentioned here. Krishna expands himself into all these bodies. And then he also says You are the cause of all causes. And Krishna himself declares in the Bhagavad Gita I am the source of all material and spiritual world. And from me everything emanates.

**Key Quote:** "Real intelligence means trying to find the ultimate cause"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material research with spiritual understanding, arguing that true intelligence lies in seeking the ultimate cause of everything, rather than just immediate causes.

So as we know that understanding Krishna who is the cause of all causes is the most important thing a human being should be engaged in. You are all so busy trying to understand different things happening in the material world. Why this happened, why that happened? Why this is like that, why that is like that? We are doing PhDs, research. They are considered to be the best of the scholars. And in the PhD what are we doing? We are trying to find the causes for different things. Why it is like this? Trying to explain something. But actually real intelligence means trying to find the ultimate cause. Because if that ultimate cause does not exist, then none of these things would exist. So we are finding this material creation so wonderful, so unique, so inconceivable. Even this tiny planet earth has got so many inconceivable wonderful things. And we are so marveled and bewildered by these wonderful things. Imagine the person who created it. How powerful and how intelligent he will be. So actually just trying to understand the immediate cause is not very intelligent. Trying to understand the ultimate cause is real intelligence.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the cause of Aham sarvasya prabhavo Matta sarvam pravartate Everything emanates from me"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a train and its engine to illustrate that Krishna is the ultimate cause, and emphasizes that surrendering to Krishna is the path to fearlessness.

Just like a simple example. In a train which is moving, it has got 10 bogies. If a person sitting in bogie number 9 is trying to understand why bogie number 10, if he is trying to understand why my bogie is moving so wonderfully and I am proceeding towards my destination, and if he tries to find the immediate cause, he will know it is because bogie 9 is pulling me. And like that if someone is sitting in bogie 9 and he is trying to find out why am I moving so fast and how wonderfully I am moving, it is because bogie 8 is pulling him. But actually these are all immediate causes. The ultimate cause for the existence of the train and for the very purpose of the train's existence is the engine. And beyond the engine there is nothing else. The engine is the cause of all causes. So a train becomes meaningless without an engine. And all the meaning that is there in all the 10 bogies and people inside the train and all the things that is happening in the train is because of the engine. Engine is the main invention, is the main find, is the main thing to understand. So in the same way Krishna is the cause of Aham sarvasya prabhavo Matta sarvam pravartate. Everything emanates from me. Whatever we see is emanating from Krishna. Brahma is also saying Sarvakarana karanam. He is the karana Sarvakarana karanam of cause of all causes. So we must all try to understand God and his wonderful creations, keeping God as the reference. So like this he is offering prayer. Now why is he offering this prayer? He is saying we are offering prayer. We are seeking shelter and protection. It ends like this, the prayer: In our fearful condition, let us take shelter of him, for we are sure that the supreme lord, the supreme soul will give us his protection. So in our fearful condition, let us take shelter of him, for we are sure that the supreme lord, the supreme soul will give us his protection. Krishna also says Just take shelter of me, surrender to me, for I am the supreme lord. So if you want to be fearless, we just have to surrender to Krishna. So here the devatas are surrendering to the supreme lord Narayana and they are offering their prayers. So now

**Key Quote:** "So this is the nature of the material world...The king of heavens is afraid...The reason because everyone is afraid in this material world...Is because the place that we are living in is not natural to us. It's a foreign place."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the pervasive nature of fear in the material world, even for those in positions of power like Indra, explaining that it stems from being in an unnatural, foreign place.

Devatas, Indra is no ordinary devata. He is in the heavenly planet. He is the king of the entire Demigods. Even he is afraid. He is not an ordinary person. So this is the nature of the material world. Whether you are the king, not only a king of this planet earth, the king of heavens is afraid. And why the king of heaven is also afraid? King of heaven must be a very wonderful comfortable life, isn't it? King has a very wonderful life. And Indra the king, not an ordinary, even he is afraid. The reason because everyone is afraid in this material world. Even an animal is afraid. A small insect is afraid. A small ant is afraid. We see many times a bird is pecking at some grains. It pecks one grain and it looks left and right. Again pecks at one more grain. Again it is looking left and right, afraid that somebody will come, kill him, afraid. Once Prabhupada was giving a talk in Vrindavan. In Vrindavan there are a lot of monkeys. So while he was talking, one monkey entered his room. Actually not a monkey, it was a baby monkey. The mother monkey and the baby monkey were there. And the windows bars are some size and the baby is very small. So through those two bars. And the moment the baby entered, baby hasn't got so much of intelligence, the mother becomes very afraid. And the mother is shouting, screaming, making sound, trying to shake the bars. And all the devotees are watching. And then they somehow try to push that baby monkey outside the window. And then the mother took it and went away. See a small insignificant being to Indra. Everyone is afraid in this material world. And the reason as Bhagavatam gives us, tells us, is because the place that we are living in is not natural to us. It's a foreign place. So in a foreign place, in a place which is not natural to our existence, fear is certain.

**Key Quote:** "We are spirit souls. A spirit soul is supposed to stay in the spiritual world serving Krishna. And if we are not there...We will be afraid."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a ship on the ocean, the speaker explains that the material world is not our natural home, and true fearlessness comes from taking shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the spiritual world.

Just like Prabhupada gives an example. In the sea, on the ship. Ship is a very safe place, right? In an ocean you are comfortably seated. But many times there are storms, there are fogs. When there is storm, the ocean becomes very turbulent. And then everyone becomes afraid. And when there is fog, again the ship stops and the ship is sounding because it's afraid that another ship will come and they will collide. In an ocean, although you are in a ship, you will always be afraid because the ocean is not your natural position. When you are on land, you will not be so afraid because land in your house is your natural position. So in the same way, we are not in our natural position, whether on this planet earth or in Indraloka or even in the highest material planet Brahmaloka. We are spirit souls. A spirit soul is supposed to stay in the spiritual world serving Krishna. And if we are not there, no matter how rich we are, how intelligent we are, how capable we are, how good a job we have, the very fact that we are in this material world, we will be afraid. So we must always be making a plan that how can I, if I want to be really fearless, I have to be in the spiritual world. I have to take shelter of the supreme personality of God. Then no matter what we are, in whatever position we are, automatically fearlessness.

**Key Quote:** "Because the Supreme Lord, so we can do that by taking strong shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Prahlad Maharaj to illustrate how devotion to the Lord leads to fearlessness, even in the face of extreme adversity, contrasting it with his powerful but fearful father.

The best example is Prahlad Maharaj. Just a small boy, 5 years old, but is completely fearless. He hasn't got some big education or anything like that, but he is fearless because he was engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. So many things he went through. He is completely fearless. It is so difficult. Imagine a small boy of 5 years. He is put into a pit of poisonous snakes, fearless. He is being pierced, he is being stamped by an elephant, fearless. He is being pierced by trident, fearless. He has even drunk poison, imagine. So only by being a devout. And on the other hand, if you see his father, he conquered Indra. He has all the wealth, all the power, but full of fear. So in the material world, fearful situations are common. It is a very. But all that we need to know, a soul, that's why the spiritual world is Vaikuntha. Vaikuntha means a place where there is no fear, there is no anxiety. Material world is full of fear and anxiety for everyone. So how do we create a fearless situation in the material world? This is our unnatural position, right? Material world is unnatural, like ocean is unnatural. But now I want to be fearless in this unnatural position, in this unnatural situation. How can I do that? Because the Supreme Lord, so we can do that by taking strong shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. God is, even though we are in an unnatural position, if we take strong shelter of His lotus feet,

we can become fearless even in this material existence which is full of fear. Bhaktivinoda Thakur has written in one song, very nicely, he says, he is describing Supreme Lord's two lotus feet, very nicely. And he says, if you take shelter of this lotus feet of Krishna, then you will become fearless. So he says, Your two lotus feet is what? It is the source of Ashoka. Ashoka, Abhaya, Amrita, Ashoka. Ashoka means, there is no Shoka, there is no lamentation. There is no sorrow, Ashoka. And Abhaya, it is fearless, it is a place where there is no fear. And Amrita, Adhaar, and they are the basis for Amrita. Or like, not only it is fearless, you will get nectar at His lotus feet. And so what have I, what will I do? Taha te ekho no vishrama labhiya, labhiya. Now I will take shelter, I will take rest at your lotus feet. Chhaadi nu bhavera bhaiya. And in this way, this bhava bhaiya, the fear of this material existence, bhava, I will be able to give up. So Ashoka Abhaya, Amrita Adhaar, tomara charana dhvaya. Taha te ekho no vishrama labhiya, chhaadi nu bhavera bhaiya. Taha te ekho no vishrama labhiya, chhaadi nu bhavera bhaiya. So how do we take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna? Very simple, to take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna, the practical method to take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna is by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. Prabhupada says in one letter he is writing, you must strongly take shelter of the, he is writing to a devotee, that you must strongly take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. You must strongly take shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna and that you can do by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. Because there is no difference between the lotus feet of Krishna and chanting Hare Krishna. It is one and the same.

**Key Quote:** "Yet, all fear is vanquished as soon as there is the sound of the Lord, represented by his holy name"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the power of the holy name to vanquish all fear, emphasizing that fear vanishes as soon as the sound of the Lord is heard.

Krishna is present in this world in the form of his holy name. So I will read a few quotes of Prabhupada. The sound of the Lord is identical with the Lord, as we have tried to explain. The material existence of our present status is full of fear. Out of the four problems of material existence, namely the food problem, the shelter problem, the fear problem and the mating problem, the fear problem gives us more trouble than the others. Eating, sleeping, mating, defending, the four miseries of the material world. Defending or fearing is giving us more problem, gives us more trouble than others. We are always fearful due to our ignorance of the next problem. Another reason of fear, I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. The whole material existence is full of problems and thus the fear problem is always prominent. This is due to our association with the illusory energy of the Lord, known as Maya or external energy. Yet, all fear is vanquished as soon as there is the sound of the Lord, represented by his holy name, as it was sounded by Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the following 16 words: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. We can take advantage of these sounds and be free from the threatening problems of material existence. So just by chanting this mantra, Prabhupada is writing, fear is vanished as soon as there is sound. So actually if you become afraid, just chant and hear. Immediately you will feel a sense of fearlessness, if you are hearing. It doesn't take long. It's not that you have to do a long practice to become fearless. Many, many, lot of chanting you have to do. Prabhupada is writing, all fear, not one or two fear, all fear is vanished. How long it takes to vanish? As soon as there is sound of the Lord. As soon as there is sound, all fear vanished. Just look at the meanings of these words. How significant it is. All fear vanished immediately as soon as there is sound. So that's why if devotees focus on hearing the sound, vibrating it very clearly, distinctly and hearing, instantly you will become fearless.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as we chant Hare Krishna, we are Vasudev Parayana, there is no more fear."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada again, emphasizing that as soon as one chants Hare Krishna, there is no more fear, and stressing the importance of sticking to this principle and not deviating from it.

It doesn't take long. Another word, another quote. Chant Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhar, Shri Vasadi Gaurabhakta Vrinda. By their favour, by the favour of Pancha Tathwa, by their mercy we can chant Hare Krishna. And as soon as we chant Hare Krishna, we are Vasudev Parayana, there is no more fear. Again here Prabhupada is saying, as soon as you chant Hare Krishna, there is no more fear. So how as soon as you chant no more fear, fear vanishes? The whole world is full of fear. Everybody today, you can see what is the situation of the world. Everybody is so afraid. So many wars, so much unrest, so much of terrorism, so much this, natural calamity. In Kerala something happened, rain. Everybody is full of fear. As soon as you chant, fearlessness, immediately. So and then Prabhupada is saying, as soon as you chant no more fear, so you stick to this principle, do not forget. Don't deviate from it. Then everything is perfect and your life is successful. So it's like Prabhupada is stressing. Just like you have a stress. Hare Nama Hare Nama Hare Nama Iva Kevalam. Kalo Naasteva Na. There is a stress. Now here see Prabhupada's stress. He says, as soon as you chant, no more fear. Now how is Prabhupada stressing? You stick to this principle. First stress. Second, do not forget. And third, don't deviate from it. And then what is the result? The result is, everything is perfect and your life is successful.

**Key Quote:** "That we can become fearless as soon as we take shelter of the Holy Name."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that Kali Yuga is an age full of fear, but the solution is simple: taking shelter of the Holy Name, which is always present and available, will immediately bring fearlessness.

Everything becomes perfect. Last one. So this is confirmed in the Bhagavatam. Sankhya Deva Krishnasya Mukta Sangha Param Vrachet. Simply by chanting, you can keep. If you follow the rules and regulations and chanting, you will not be victimized. You will not be victimized. You will make your progress without any fear. So Kali Yuga is an age full of fear and anxiety. It is the dark age. But as we know, we have heard it in Bhagavatam, this age is worshipped. It is glorified. It is better than Satya Yuga. Because the problem of fear which gives us the maximum trouble, as Prabhupada is writing, out of the eating, sleeping, fearing and defending, has a very simple and easy solution. That we can become fearless as soon as we take shelter of the Holy Name. So here we see the Devatas, they become very afraid, full of fear, because the huge demon Vritrasura has appeared. And so they are taking shelter of Narayana. And Narayana is present in this age 24 bar 7. Every moment Narayana is present in this Holy Name, we just have to hear the sound attentively. And as soon as we hear the sound, immediately we will become fearless. So we will end here. Vrindra Ashi Mad Bhagavatam Ki. Shila Prabhupada Ki.

**Summary:** The speaker reads and translates verses from Srimad Bhagavatam describing the appearance of Lord Hari and Narayana along with sixteen attendants after the demigods offer prayers.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 6, Chapter 9, Text No. 28, 29 and 30. Shri Shukha Uvacha, Iti Tesham Maharaja, Suranam Upatishthatam, Pratichyam Dishya Bhudabhihi, Shankachakra Gadadharah. Translation by His Divine Grace, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. Shri Shukadev Goswami said, My dear King, when all the demigods offered Him their prayers, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari, carrying His weapons, the conch shell, desk and club, appeared first within their hearts and then before them. This is no purport, so I'll read the next verse by myself. Atma Tulyai Shodasha Bhir Vina Sri Vatsa Kaustubha Pariyo Paasitam Unniya Nidra Shadadamburu Hekshanam Drishtvatam Avanosarva Ekshanah Lada Viklavaha Dandavat Patita Rajan Chaner Uthaya Tushtuvahu.

O King, when all the demigods saw the Supreme Lord in that posture, smiling with eyes like the petals of the lotus, they were overwhelmed with happiness and immediately fell down like rods offering dandavats. Then they slowly rose and pleased the Lord by offering Him prayers.

**Key Quote:** "So in this chapter, Appearance of Demon Vritrasura, in just a few verses before, we saw how the demon Vritrasura appeared and under what conditions he appeared."
**Summary:** The speaker provides context to the verses by summarizing the events leading to the Lord's appearance, including the appearance of Vritrasura and the demigods' prayers.

So in this chapter, Appearance of Demon Vritrasura, in just a few verses before, we saw how the demon Vritrasura appeared and under what conditions he appeared. Indra and all the devatas have lost their kingdom. So they are praying. They first, we know the whole story, that how they got Vishwarupa as their priest to help them and win back their kingdom. And then Vishwarupa was sikandhu. He was secretly offering the ahutis in the sacrificial fire. He was offering oblations to please the devatas, to please the Supreme Lord on behalf of the devatas and also on behalf of the demons. So Indra becomes angry and in a fit of anger, he beheads Vishwarupa, kills him. And then Vishwarupa's father, Tvashta, becomes very angry. And then Tvashta starts a sacrifice where he intended to produce, to generate a personality who will be the demon of Indra and will kill Indra. But the reverse effect happens because he chanted the mantra long instead of chanting the mantra short. So instead of, because of that mistake, the personality arose, a fearful demon who was supposed to be the enemy of Indra, but because the mantra was chanted wrong, Indra becomes his enemy. And so Indra, we will see later in the next chapter how Indra will kill him. So when this demon Vritrasura appeared, he was very, very powerful, very fearful, very vast, very ghastly. It was like appearing as if the whole universe, the whole creation will come to an end. And so all the devatas, they have no other option now but to seek shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of God. They are offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So they have just finished offering their prayers and at this point of time, a wonderful thing has happened. The Supreme Personality of God personally appears. It's no ordinary thing. The Lord has appeared in His full form. Actually this chapter is called Appearance of Demon Vritrasura and there is also the Appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari and Narayan.

#### Appearance in the heart, Manifestation, Devotion

**Key Quote:** "He appeared first within their hearts and then He appeared before them. This was the process of appearance."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the process of the Lord's appearance, first in the heart and then externally, drawing parallels with Krishna's appearance to Devaki and Dhruva Maharaja's experience.

So these two verses are describing how the Lord has appeared. It says here, Abhud Aavihi. Abhud means He became manifested. He became visible. Aavihi means He appeared. And how did He appear? He appeared first within their hearts and then He appeared before them. This was the process of appearance. We have a very similar thing we see in Lord Krishna's appearance at the prison house of Kamsa in Mathura to Mother Devaki. Krishna also appeared in the same way. First He appeared in the heart of Vasudev. Then from the heart of Vasudev He gets transferred to the heart of Devaki and then He appears. So something very similar we are seeing here also. The Lord first appeared in the heart and then the Lord manifested Himself outside. And something similar we saw in Dhruva's also, when Dhruva was chanting the mantra Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Actually the Lord appears first in His heart as a Paramatma. Dhruva could clearly see. And then suddenly His meditation on the Vishnu Murthi broke. He was seeing the Lord in His heart and then it broke and He was wondering where did the Lord disappear? And then He opened His eyes and He saw the Lord was right in front of Him standing in His beautiful form of Vishnu. So this Lord first appearing in the heart and then appearing, manifesting in front of the devotees is a very wonderful Leela of the Lord.

#### Lord's Entourage, Vaikuntha Features, Demigods' Reaction

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Here also the Lord has appeared with 16 more personal attendants. And there is only one difference between the Lord's appearance and the appearance of these 16 attendants."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Lord's appearance with attendants, highlighting the distinguishing features of the Lord (Srivatsa and Kaustubha gem) and the demigods' overwhelming happiness and subsequent prayers.

And the Lord appears like this to satisfy His devotees when His devotees are rendering pure devotional service. It's not an ordinary thing for the Lord to appear. It's an extraordinary thing. And here, how the Lord has appeared. He has not just appeared alone like Prabhupada says, when the King goes, the King doesn't go alone. The King goes with His whole entourage. And so, here also the Lord has appeared with 16 more personal attendants. And there is only one difference between the Lord's appearance and the appearance of these 16 attendants. That is, because in the Vaikuntha planet everybody has features of Lord Vishnu, the four-handed form. But to distinguish between the Lord's associates, the Lord's devotees in the Vaikuntha and the Lord Himself, there has to be some demarcation that He is the Supreme Lord. Because everybody there appears with four hands, with a helmet and with everything. The only differentiating factor is that the Lord has two features which none of His associates have in Vaikuntha. And what are those two features? He has the Srivatsa mark on His chest. Srivatsa is a tuft of, a curl of white hair on His chest. And He has the beautiful, valuable, magnificent Kaustubha gem, the jewel, which is suspended on His neck and which is hanging on His chest. So, when He appeared, surrounding and serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, were 16 personal attendants decorated with ornaments and appearing exactly like Him, but without the mark of Srivatsa and Kaustubha jewel. And all the devatas were so overwhelmed with happiness. Ekshana, by seeing the Lord Sarve Ahalada. They were all filled with happiness. Ahalada means they were so happy. Imagine the Lord has appeared in front of them. And what happened? They were overwhelmed. Viklavaha, overwhelmed. And so in that state of happiness and overwhelming happiness, what did they do? Dandavat Patithaha. Patithaha means they fell down and they offered dandavats to the Lord. And then they shanahi, they slowly utthaya, they slowly got up after offering dandavats and once again they started tushtuvuhu, they started offering prayers. So they offered prayers, the Lord was pleased and satisfied, Lord appeared and soon after that they offered the dandavats and again they start offering, glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana with wonderful prayers.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Lord becomes visible through sincere chanting and extraordinary bhakti, highlighting that the entire Bhagavatam is a scripture of pure bhakti.

So here as we see this is a very momentous occasion that the Lord has appeared. It's no ordinary thing. The word used here is avihi. Avihi means he became visible. He appeared in front of them. So this morning when we were, we have those quotes of Srila Prabhupada going on in the main temple hall and there Prabhupada is also writing that if one is chanting the Hare Krishna mantra very sincerely, very attentively then the Lord will appear in front of the devotee. There are many places where Prabhupada says but that chanting has to be like the Lord appearance is no extraordinary, it's an extraordinary event. So similarly and the Lord here appeared just by offering prayers. So actually if we engage in bhakti, if we engage in our devotional service very sincerely, very seriously, it should be extraordinary bhakti. That is when the Lord will make his appearance. Prabhupada writes in this human form of life, our goal should be to see the supreme personality of Godhead face to face. So for that ordinary bhakti it's an extraordinary bhakti that and if you see the

**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Dhruva and Prahlad Maharaj to illustrate the power of serious devotional service, emphasizing that the Lord appears to those engaged in pure bhakti.

entire bhagavatam is actually a scripture which is talking of pure bhakti. The beginning of bhagavatam is dharma projjhita kaitavotra paramo nirmatsaraanam satam. The entire bhagavatam is a scripture dealing with pure devotional service. Dhruva, although he had a heart with, you know, he had some material desires but he took to the practice of devotional service that his spiritual master gave him very, very seriously. And just by chanting the mantra the Lord appeared in front of him. Prahlad Maharaj also was seeing when he was actually when he was asked by his father Hiranyakashipu, is the Lord there in the pillar? He said yes he is there because Prahlad was seeing. Prahlad was also doing pure devotional service. So if we are engaged in this process of bhakti very seriously then Aavihi Krishna will appear. So Prabhupada writes and in the bhagavatam also many places it is said that we should be engaged in intense devotional service. Not just devotional service. Yesterday also we were discussing about this. Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena. It is not just Bhakti Yogena but Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena. So here this is Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena. This is Lord Kapila, this is the prayer of Lord Kapila, these are the teachings of Lord Kapila to his mother

Devahuthi and then here Prabhupada is translating Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena like this Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena Manomai Arpitam Sthiram. Therefore persons whose minds are fixed on the Lord engage in intensive practice of devotional service, that is the only means for attainment of the final perfection of life. So Kapila is talking about the final perfection in life and there is only one means to attain the final perfection so we should be actually hankering for this, I want the highest perfection and there is only one means that is Ti Vrena Bhakti Yogena, intensive practice of devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Bali Maharaj and Sudama to further illustrate intense devotional service, highlighting their selfless surrender and devotion to the Lord.

Now and if you see all the chapters, all the stories in Srimad Bhagavatam are rotating and revolving around this. Bali Maharaj also, he practiced intense devotional service because when the Lord, what was his intense devotional service that Bali Maharaj practiced when the Lord came and he knew that everything is going away from his hand and asked him now you have to give me, you have given me everything, now nothing is remaining, what will you give me? He offered himself also and very happily he offered himself. You see the intense devotional service that Bali Maharaj did and then the Lord blessed him. Bali Maharaj was not thinking okay if I give away everything the Lord will bless me so let me give away, no he did not have any of those calculations, he just gave everything to the Lord because he knows finally everything belongs to the Lord and for complete surrender to the Lord. So as I was mentioning that this is what the entire Bhagavatam is talking about. So there are some words let us go through them, few of them which explains, which defines what is intense devotional service. Intense, we have heard the story of Sudama, even Sudama's service was intense devotional service, he had so much of requirement, his wife had sent him to Lord Krishna, they had no food to eat, his children was starving, he was starving, the entire family was starving but Sudama did not ask anything to the Lord, he just went to the Lord with a very simple humble offering and we know the whole story how the Lord blessed him, he just wanted bhakti to the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of the florist Sudama, who asked for achala bhakti (unshakable devotion) from Lord Krishna, emphasizing the importance of unwavering faith.

Now there is one more Sudama, he is the florist Sudama and he meets the Supreme Lord when Krishna and Balaram go to Mathura to fight Kamsa when Akrura invites him, they go to Mathura and there they meet many, many different people. So there at one point of time this florist Sudama meets Krishna and the florist welcomes him very nicely and then he asks, the florist asks, my dear Lord please tell me how will I please you, what can I do for you? And because he was a florist he offered two very beautifully woven, exquisite and very fragrant flower garlands to Lord Krishna and Krishna and Balaram. So they were very pleased, Lord Krishna was very pleased with this florist's offering, pure offering and at that time Krishna asks him ok what do you want? Actually he was a florist, you can imagine florist means a very humble person, you know he was just hardly having any possessions and what did he ask? So here it is mentioned now you have to choose what you want to ask. So what did he choose to ask? He asked achalam bhaktim tasmin. He said I want your achala bhakti. So this is what his ask was, achala bhakti means achala means which moves, which shakes, achala bhakti means which is unshakable devotion. So this should be our prayer to the Lord just like the simple ordinary man is able to make this prayer, he chose this kind of a prayer, Lord please bless me with achala bhakti, my faith, my devotion to you should never shake, I should eternally remain your servant.

So you see when we, you know this is the bhakti, this is the kind of bhakti that we must be always practicing.

#### Atmarama Verse, Ahaituki Bhakti, Causeless Devotion

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "What is this intense practice of devotional service it's called ahaitukim bhakti achala bhakti ahaitukim bhakti ahaitukim bhakti means causeless devotional service or unalloyed devotional service means our bhakti to the Lord should not be mixed with anything"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of ahaituki bhakti (causeless or unalloyed devotion) from the Atmarama verse, emphasizing that devotion should be free from material desires or motivations.

Then so in so many places this is achala bhakti, then that famous Atmarama verse that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu also elaborated upon, Atmarama shchumunayo nirgantha apyurukrame kurvanti ahaitukim bhaktim itthambhuta gunoharihi. So here we see what kind of a bhakti we must be offering, what is this intense practice of devotional service? It's called ahaitukim bhakti, achala bhakti, ahaitukim bhakti. Ahaitukim bhakti means causeless devotional service or unalloyed devotional service means our bhakti to the Lord should not be mixed with anything, with any ask, with any demand or I should not be doing bhakti for some cause, for some material gain, my bhakti is the supreme lord, he is my supreme father, he is my supreme well wisher, whatever I possess is all coming from him just like a mother is not serving the children, mother is not serving the family with the hope of getting something, she only wants one thing, what is that? Pure love. Similarly here it says that Atmarama means even those exalted souls, pure devotees, they are not ordinary souls, ahaitukim bhakti, unalloyed devotion like Prabhupada writes alloy means it's a mixture of two metals so unalloyed devotion means devotion without the mixture of any frutive desire without asking anything from the Lord our bhakti should be towards the Lord like that.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Prahlad Maharaj's teachings on amalaya bhakti (spotless devotional service) to his demoniac friends, emphasizing that the Lord is pleased only by unflinching, unalloyed devotion.

Then Prahlad is teaching to his friends, you may think that Atmaramas are doing ahaitukim bhakti, they are all very exalted souls and at that level this ahaitukim bhakti is possible but here we see a small boy Prahlad, he is teaching to his friends who are also small children of his age 5 years and they are not even devotees, they are just, they are children belonging to demon families so they are nowhere in devotional service and small children to them Prahlad is teaching what kind of bhakti you should perform, he is saying you all should perform amalaya bhaktia, amalaya bhakti. See the teachings of the Bhagavatam even a small child teaching to small children pure devotional service, he is not just teaching bhakti he is teaching amalaya bhakti and Prabhupada translates this amalaya bhakti as spotless devotional service. So he is telling my dear friends oh son of the demons you cannot please the supreme personality of godhead by becoming perfect brahmanas, demigods or great saints or by becoming perfectly good in etiquette or vast learning you cannot please the lord by all these things none of these qualifications can awaken the pleasure of the lord nor by charity, austerity, sacrifice, cleanliness or vows can one satisfy the lord, the lord is pleased only by amalaya bhakti by unflinching unalloyed devotion to him this is what he is teaching.

amalaya bhakti and then so achalam bhaktim these are what the bhagavatam is all talking about achalam bhaktim ahetukim bhaktim amalaya bhakti and then yet in another place this is teachings of lord kapila so you see at all levels the same teaching is being given so in the teachings of lord kapila to his mother devahuti he is also saying something similar to mother devahuti and to everyone bhajanti ananyaya bhaktia ananyaya bhaktia means ananya means no with something else ananya means unflinching without the mixture of anything else ananyaya bhaktia so here thus the devotees who worship me the all pervading lord of the universe in unflinching devotional service gives up all aspirations to be promoted to the heavenly planets or to become happy in this world with wealth children cattle home or anything in relationship with the body i take him to the other side of birth and death so actually we all know goal of life is to get go back to the spiritual world go back to the vaikuntha loka where there is no birth no death so this is the qualification needed it is not just bhakti that will take us there yes bhakti will eventually take us but eventually we have to get into this ananya bhakti he says devotees who worship in unflinching devotional service giving up all aspirations to be promoted to heavenly planet or to become happy in this world with wealth with children with cattle with home i then i take them to the other side of birth and death.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of believing in Srila Prabhupada's words and following his instructions, quoting Prabhupada on how the Lord will automatically reveal himself through offenseless chanting.

It is possible if you follow the steps, the process that Srila Prabhupada has given. I will just read two quotes of Srila Prabhupada and see with what Prabhupada is writing. Look at the confidence, the conviction that Prabhupada carried with him. Prabhupada says, I have only, people call me that I have become very successful, there is no credit to myself. Yes there is only one thing that if there is any credit to me. And that? That if there is any credit for myself, that is I followed the instructions of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur as it is and I believed in his words. I simply believed in the words of my spiritual master. So just like Prabhupada simply believed in the words of the spiritual master, we must also actually believe in the words of Srila Prabhupada. So Prabhupada writes, now we are talking of seeing the Lord, like the demigods are seeing Aavihi, the Supreme Lord has appeared. So how do we see the Lord? One should not artificially try to see the form of the Lord while chanting Hare Krishna. But when the chanting is performed offenselessly, the Lord will automatically reveal himself to the view of the chanter. The chanter therefore has to concentrate on hearing the vibration. And without extra endeavour on his part, the Lord will automatically appear. You see, the Lord will appear automatically without any extra endeavour, if we simply concentrate on hearing. And he says automatically appear and the Lord will automatically reveal. This is what we are talking about.

**Key Quote:** "The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty of a dying man is very important."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Maharaj Pariksit's two questions about duty in life and at the time of death, explaining their significance and how the Srimad Bhagavatam addresses them, emphasizing devotional service as the ultimate duty.

Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, first canto, 19th chapter, 24th verse, appearance of Shukadev Goswami. Translation, O trustworthy brahmanas, I now ask you about my immediate duty. Please, after proper deliberation, tell me of the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances and specifically of those who are just about to die. Purport, in this verse, the king has placed two questions before the learned sages. The first question is, what is the duty of everyone in all circumstances? And the second question is, what is the specific duty of one who is to die very shortly? Out of the two, the question relating to the dying man is most important, because everyone is a dying man, either very shortly or after 100 years. The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty of a dying man is very important. Maharaj Pariksit placed these two questions before Shukadev Goswami also on his arrival. And practically the whole of Srimad Bhagavatam, beginning from the second canto up to the last 12th canto, deals with these two questions. The conclusion arrived at thereof is that, devotional service of Lord Srikrishna, as it is confirmed by Lord himself in the last phases of the Bhagavad Gita, is the last word in relation to everyone's permanent duty in life. Maharaj Pariksit was already aware of this fact, but he wanted the great sages assembled there to unanimously give their verdict on his conviction, so that he might be able to go on with his confirmed duty without controversy.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of asking the right questions and highlights the significance of surrendering to the Lord as the ultimate path to self-realization, emphasizing that the entire Srimad Bhagavatam is based on these two questions.

He has specifically mentioned the word Shuddha or perfectly correct. For transcendental realization or self-realization, many processes are recommended by various classes of philosophers. Some of them are first class methods and some of them are second or third class methods. The first class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender unto the lotus feet of Lord and thus be saved from all sins and their reactions. So in this verse, Parikshit Maharaj is asking something very important to all the sages who have assembled there in the forest of Naimisharanya. He has just been cursed by the son of the Rishi, Sringi, that boy. And the curse is that he is supposed to die in seven days. He receives a death notice, something very unique, Prabhupada writes. And he is asking two very, very important questions. Prabhupada writes that the quality of question itself is so wonderful. Just the question itself is so wonderful. What are the two questions he is asking? Number one, what is the ultimate duty, the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances? Not just what is my duty, his duty. Everyone's duty, unalloyed duty, the highest duty in all circumstances. It's like everything is covered in this. And then the second question that he is asking is, and the duty of someone who is about to die immediately. These are the two questions and Prabhupada writes in the purport, the entire Srimad Bhagavatam is based out of these two questions. Right from the second canto, this is the 19th chapter of the first canto. The first canto is ending now. And now the second canto to 12th canto is all based on these two questions.

Something was missing or something like that. So he went to bring some puja items from the market and then family members are waiting for him to come back. And he is not returning. And then after a while it was a matter of concern what happened. And then somehow they got a call after some time that he is, who is this and he is your father and he is on the road and please come. He looks like something has happened. Please come and they were all shocked and they rushed to the place from where the call came. And what had happened actually, he was carrying the puja items or something like that. He was walking and he was going and one vehicle came and hit him. It was not a very big hit, it was a small hit. And he fell down, the way he fell down something on his brain got hurt. And he was rushed to the hospital. And the doctor says 24 hours is very critical. We cannot say anything like that. But as Krishna had desired after 24 hours he passed away. This news came as a big shock. Imagine the excitement, griha pravesha, new house, new apartment. And this is what happened and nobody had any idea about it.

**Summary:** The speaker shares a near-death experience and emphasizes the importance of taking devotional service seriously and becoming Krishna conscious quickly, as it is the ultimate duty.

So every moment we must remind ourselves that we have a very important duty. And I must complete that duty before I die. Just yesterday it happened. We were all travelling to Haridas Thakur's birthplace and we were in the first vehicle. Ten of us were there. And just we were driving, the driver was driving, it was at a medium speed. And just about 15-20 meters ahead of us one big tree branch just fell on the road. It was like first time live we saw it. It got captured on the video. And it was a fraction of 3-4 seconds. If we were 3-4 seconds ahead. It was a huge one. It occupied the entire expanse of the road. It just fell. It was some old tree or something like that. And see how Krishna saved us. So this verse is actually talking about how seriously we must take to devotional service. What is the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances. The question itself is so serious. I must become Krishna conscious very soon, very quickly. Because unless and until you become perfectly Krishna conscious, we have not actually done our duty.

**Key Quote:** "But one must be very serious and sincere."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of humility and sincerity in prayer and devotional service, emphasizing that Krishna will purify and deliver those who are serious and sincere.

We chant that verse, Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu doya koro more. Toma bina ke dayalu jagata samsare. And what is the second verse? Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu doya koro more. And what is the second line? Patita pavan hetu tavey avataar. Mosama patita Prabhu na paiy beyaar. So we sing this every day. And then we say, we offer a prayer to Krishna, that Krishna, I am the most fallen. And since I am the most fallen, my claim is first on being delivered. Please claim me. I am the most fitting candidate for being delivered. And then your name as Patita, your name as Patita Pavana will be truly glorified. We pray like that. Prabhupada in one place writes something more than this. Yes, we can pray. Definitely we should pray that I am the most fallen so my claim is first. But then in what should be a mood and what should be a consciousness of praying and a practice of devotional service. So Prabhupada quotes these two lines and then soon after that he writes, But one must be very serious and sincere. It is not that yes, it is good to pray that I am the most fallen and so please deliver me first. But we should be very sincere, very serious and then Krishna will deliver us from, He will purify us from all contamination surely and certainly. So actually if we read Srila Prabhupada's books, we will get this sense. This sense should be absorbed from Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada's life itself, he is a living example of how serious and sincere he was. Writing books, midnight, 12 o'clock, getting up at 4 o'clock. You see the seriousness and how serious Prabhupada was in spreading Krishna consciousness. With just 40 rupees, he is trying, he is struggling, he is endeavouring. And all over his lectures, all over his books, He gives this impression to us that we must be very serious and sincere.

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of intensive devotional service as the only means to achieve final perfection in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing the need to be 100% Krishna conscious to return to Godhead.

There is one, recently I read one line. So just to give you a sense of how Prabhupada through his teachings is talking, stressing about seriousness and sincerity. So this is one line which talks and like this you can find innumerable lines. We practice devotional service as practice of devotional service is the means to attain perfection. So there are three words here. Practice of devotional service is the means to attain perfection. Now for each of these three words, one more word has been added. We must practice intensive devotional service, not just devotional service. And intensive devotional service is the only means to attain final perfection in Krishna consciousness. So look at the word. Intensive devotional service is the only means for final perfection of Krishna consciousness. So we all have to go for the final perfection. Even if we are 99.9% Krishna conscious, there is no going back to Godhead. We have to be 100% Krishna conscious.

**Summary:** The speaker quotes verses emphasizing the importance of hearing, chanting, remembering, and worshiping with one-pointed attention, urging devotees to reflect on the intensity of their devotional service.

And that is why, the reply to these two questions. What is the answer that Shukadev Goswami is giving? Tasmad ekina manasa. Tasmad. Okay, there are many verses. But yeah, this is exactly. There are. Tasmad. So Tasmad Bharata Sarvatma. Read that. Bhagwan Ishwaro Harihi. Shotavya. Kirti Tavyasya. Gheya. Smrtavya Cha. Chitavayam. Chitavayam. Achitavayam. So and actually there are many verses. And one more place. So this is one verse where he is talking about. Tasmad Bharata Sarvatma. Bhagwan Ishwaro Harihi. Sarvatma. Everyone. Bhagwan Ishwaro Harihi. And what they should do? Hear, chant, remember, worship. And in another place Shukadev Goswami is saying. Tasmad ekina manasa. Bhagwan Satvatam Patihi. Shotavya. Kirti Tavyasya. Gheya. Pujas. Cha. Nityadhar. Ekina manasa. Ekina manasa means with one pointed attention. Another way. A perfect reply for a perfect question. One should, Shotavya, Kirti Tavyasya, hear, chant, Gheya, remember, Pujas, worship, Cha, Nityadhar, Nityadhar means constantly. So devotees should actually reflect on all these things, that am I doing my devotional service with this intensity, with this force. In another place Prabhupada is right. We should not be doing devotional service casually, but we should be doing devotional service seriously, constantly. So this Govarmandal Parikshan, Parikrama that we are all out, it's an opportunity for us during these 20 days to actually engage in this intensive practice of devotional service, because Ekina manasa. It is very, it is sometimes, because we are not, we are still conditioned. We are not on that stage where we can practice this 24 hours. But at least these 20 days that we have, we should take this opportunity, remember these instructions and make the best use of this opportunity that is there. I must at least for these days, Shotavya, Kirti Tavya, Shadheyya, Poojas, Cha Nityada, Ekina Manasa. All these things can be practiced.

**Summary:** The speaker encourages listeners to pray to Srila Prabhupada for help in practicing devotional service with sincerity and eagerness, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to engage in intensive practice.

It is not very difficult. It is just that we need to be in that consciousness. We need to keep, we must keep reminding ourselves of these instructions and pray to Srila Prabhupada, that Srila Prabhupada please help me. I wish to do. So before we get into this mood, first a desire should be there and a prayer, a heartfelt prayer should be there, that yes Prabhupada I want to do like this. I am unable to do like this and please help me. And so when Prabhupada sees that a devotee is very sincere and very eager in becoming like that, we will be blessed with this opportunity. So like yesterday we were there in such a wonderful place, Haridas Thakur Samadhi and sorry, Bhajan Kotir and the appearance place. And we saw that tree also. It was so much different. So it all, all these, this is a very one, I am realizing now after coming here. You know that what a wonderful, we have read. So all these pastimes in CC and different places of Prabhupada. But when you come here and you be in that place, I am sure all of you have this experience. Some of you shared also. It is so much different from just reading. It is giving us, this intensive practice of devotional service actually comes so easily. So we should be grateful to Prabhupada, be grateful to all the devotees who have you know organized this, because so nicely it is coming, so easily it is coming.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates a pastime of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, explaining how He defined 'Lakshishwar' not as a millionaire, but as one who chants one lakh holy names every day, emphasizing the importance of chanting.

And it's a, so yesterday we read that story of Hira Devi, right? Hira Devi, Lakshah, Lakshah, Lakshah, Lakshah. No, she was Hira Devi, Hira Bai. Hira Bai. Hira Bai she was. Later she became Lakshahira. A small pastime which I heard something about Lakshahira. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he would, devotees would invite Chaitanya Mahaprabhu for the, for lunch. That was a, that was a system, that 12 o'clock, the noon time lunch, Mahaprabhu would take in the house of devotees. And all the devotees, he was very eager to host Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to, because that was a devotional service and they wanted to do that. And Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he realized that he is receiving too many invitations. So every day you can accept only one invitation. But there were so many devotees of Lord Chaitanya that every day he was receiving 3 to 4 invitations. So Mahaprabhu had to devise a method by which, you know, it is reduced to just one invitation. So he says from today I am going to accept invitations from only those devotees who are Lakshishwar. Lakshishwar. Lakshishwar means, it is something synonymous to, in Calcutta, Lakpati. Lakpati. It was a very well known term. This is about 30 years back. Lakpati means, now a days it is all crorepati. Lakpati is gone. Millionaire. So, Lakpati means, you possess a lakh of rupees. You can imagine what a Laksh, Lakpati would be during Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's time. But there were, Hiranya and Gordhan Majundar were there like that. So, so, Mahaprabhu says, from today I am going to accept invitations only from these people. So everybody thought, oh my god, Lakpati. None of them were Lakpati. They were all very simple devotees. Kola, Vicha, Shridhara, you know what he was. So they thought that, okay, from today then we can't host Mahaprabhu because that is the condition that he has placed. And then Mahaprabhu said something. He was actually basically trying to impress upon, stress upon, intensive devotional service. He said, no, Lakshishwar means, Ishwar means a lord of one lakh, not one lakh rupees. You should be possessing, not one lakh rupees, you should be possessing one lakh holy names every day.

**Key Quote:** "Except chanting, a person has no other duty."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of chanting, highlighting that it is the only duty in this human form of life, and mentions Srila Prabhupada's instruction to chant 16 rounds minimum.

So, and this is what Gaudiya Math was actually. They were chanting one lakh holy names every day, 64 rounds. And actually if you see, Srila Prabhupada also in the initial days, he told, you chant 64 rounds. And that is why our rule is, 16 rounds minimum. That word minimum is there. So all these things, when you read and hear, it is actually stressing on this word, intensive practice of devotional service. And this is our duty, only duty, for everyone, in all circumstances. In one place Srila Prabhupada is saying, directly is pointing out, except chanting, a person has no other duty. Except chanting, there is no other duty in this holy, in this human form of life. So basically all these things, you know, it is stressing. So at least 16 rounds, yes finally we have 16 rounds with us and we should stick to 16 rounds and engage ourselves in devotional service, because that is what finally Prabhupada gave us. But these 16 rounds must be of good quality. And if you, in 1976, there are many letters that Srila Prabhupada, Prabhupada keeps writing so many letters to different devotees. If you search the Veda base, in 1976, it is 76 or 75, one of these years, Prabhupada is writing to disciples, that please chant 16 good rounds. And if you search on this, 16 good, he is not saying please chant 16 rounds. He is stressing something, chant 16 good rounds.

**Key Quote:** "Please chant 16 good rounds."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of chanting 16 good rounds, citing Srila Prabhupada's letters and a devotee's explanation that chanting all rounds in one go constitutes good rounds.

So we should ask ourselves, am I chanting good rounds? And he doesn't write this to one disciple. In one year, he writes about 16 letters. In all the 16 letters, this line is repeating, please chant 16 good rounds. So our prayers to Srila Prabhupada and this should be a prayer to all the Leelas Thalis that we visit today, that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, today we are going to Roop Sanatan, place where they did their bhajana. Let us offer this prayer. I am sure all of you are offering, that please help me in doing, you know, chanting good rounds and doing intensive practice of devotion service, so that we become more serious and become perfect before we meet our last days. Thank you. Anybody wishes to say something on the 16 rounds, good rounds. Srila Prabhupada said that 16 rounds good rounds means you chant them all in one go. Ok very good. You chant them all in one go, because that is good rounds. Ok. If you chant, if you chant the rounds, here one here two there three there, by the time it is evening, you just want to chew them up. If we can chant all rounds, all together 16 rounds, the whole day will be a complete different day. I have also realized this and I am sure many devotees would have also realized this. All in one go and that is really, that is a good definition of 16 good rounds. . . . .

**Key Quote:** "All our austerities are actually centered around devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that true austerity (Tapasya) is centered around devotional service to Krishna, not material gains, and that even traditional Vratas are only beneficial on a material plane unless connected to Krishna consciousness.

Vrishabhadeva said to his sons that, "Tapo Divyam Putraka Yena Satvam Shuddhe." Heart will become cleansed by practicing austerities. And we have some very simple austerities to practice: rising early in the morning, chanting 16 rounds, taking morning bath. All our austerities are actually centered around devotional service. The goal of austerity is service to Krishna, not to attain some power or some material opulence. Tapasa, you are doing Tapasya. If you are doing worship of Krishna, that is the highest Tapasya. There is no need of any other higher Tapasya. And if you are not engaged in devotional service, then all of you will be in trouble. Any other so-called Tapasya we may be doing, like sometimes some people say, "I am doing this Vrata, I am doing that Vrata, I am doing Somvar Vrata," or I am... All that is good, but it is only at a material plane. We follow Ekadashi to please Krishna. That's why if you see, all the Tapasyas and Krishna consciousness in our life...

She is not saying, "Are you Brahmana, are you, you have enough Punya or not." She is not checking and giving. She is simply distributing Krishna Bhakti to one and all. And Lord Chaitanya is telling, "I alone cannot distribute. I mean, I want all of you to take up this task and simply distribute these fruits of Krishna consciousness. This Hare Krishna mantra is the fruit which we have to distribute to everyone. You taste it and you distribute."

**Summary:** Inducing even one person to become Krishna conscious is a success, and one should focus on serving the Lord rather than understanding His deeds.

So somehow or other, if we can induce even one person to become Krishna conscious, then that is success. Srila Prabhupada also writes in Bhagavad Gita, if you see the preface of Bhagavad Gita, Prabhupada writes in the last paragraph, I'll just read this. A living entity is happily the part and parcel of the Lord and thus is not a part and parcel of the Lord. A living entity is pleased with the good deeds of the Lord. A living entity is pleased with the good deeds of the Lord and thus is not a part and parcel of the Lord. It is all the good deeds of the Lord that are called as good deeds. Do not try to understand the good deeds of the Lord, but simply understand the service.

By the spell of illusion, one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms, which will never make him happy.

One has to understand this central point of Bhagavad Gita. This is a central point. What is that? Instead of satisfying our own senses independently, we have to satisfy the senses of the Lord. This is central point

of Bhagavad Gita. Our Krishna consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this central point and because we are not polluting the theme of Bhagavad Gita as it is, anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the Bhagavad Gita must take help from the Krishna consciousness movement for practical understanding of Bhagavad Gita under the direct guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest benefit by studying Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavad Gita as it is, as we have presented it here, and if even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, we shall consider our attempt a success. So Prabhupada is writing, if even one man becomes a pure devotee by studying this Bhagavad Gita as it is, then Srila Prabhupada says, he considers it as a success. So that means we can see how difficult

**Summary:** The first step is to induce pure devotion, and a spiritual master feels responsible for guiding a disciple back to Krishna, even if the disciple misunderstands.

The first step is to induce a conditioned soul to take up pure devotion to Krishna. In one letter, Prabhupada writes to his disciple, in 1967, some senior disciples of Prabhupada had left the movement, Kirtananda, Hayagriva, like that some disciples had left and Prabhupada has written one letter about how a spiritual master feels when a disciple leaves and goes. So Prabhupada writes, "When you left us, I simply prayed to Krishna for your return to Krishna consciousness because that was my duty. Any good soul who approaches me once for spiritual enlightenment is supposed to be depending on my responsibility to get him back, back to Krishna, back to home. The disciple may misunderstand me. a bona fide spiritual master being obliged to do so under pressure of Maya's influence."

**Summary:** A spiritual master regrets when a disciple leaves due to Maya's influence, sometimes even crying, as illustrated by an anecdote about Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur.

But what Guru feels, Prabhupada is writing, when a disciple misunderstands a bona fide spiritual master, the master regrets for his inability to protect the disciple and sometimes he cries with tears in his eyes. So spiritual master cries, when a disciple leaves him and goes away, he cries helplessly. We had an experience while my Guru Maharaj was alive. One of his disciples who accepted sanyasa was one day forcibly dragged by his wife. My Guru Maharaj lamented with tears in his eyes saying that he could not save the soul. So Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, he had one disciple who was a sanyasi and wife came again. Generally after taking sanyasa, sanyasi should not meet the wife. But somehow this wife was very powerful, Maya. She went and dragged him back and Guru started crying that he could not save that soul.

**Key Quote:** "The greatest offence is to defy the spiritual master and to act sinfully, thinking in the strength of chanting."
**Summary:** The only guarantee against Maya's attack is chanting Hare Krishna offenselessly, but defying the spiritual master and deliberately sinning while relying on chanting are the greatest offenses.

So we should always therefore be careful in the matter of being attacked by Maya's influence. And the only means of guarantee is to chant Hare Krishna offenselessly: Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. So if we chant Hare Krishna mantra offenselessly, only then we are guaranteed of Maya's attack, protection of Maya's attack. So this is the only way Prabhupada is writing. But still we should be careful of the offences against chanting the holy name. Prabhupada writes, "The greatest offence is to defy the spiritual master and to act sinfully, thinking in the strength of chanting. If a man thinks that chanting will save him from all kinds of sinful reaction and deliberately commit sin, then he becomes greatest offender."

**Summary:** This segment explains the fundamental difference between the Deity of Krishna and deities of demigods, highlighting Krishna's unlimited nature and ability to be present in the Deity form.

How are the Deities or Demigods different from the Deity of Krishna? Because the Devatas are living beings. They cannot be at multiple places at the same time, while Krishna does not have such limits. Yes. One thing, when it is Krishna, Krishna Deity body is Krishna's energy only. So for him, you know, to be in a Deity body is not an issue at all. He is present there and he can receive everything through the Deity, all these things.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says that one who, anybody who has faith in anybody, I am seated in their heart and I make that faith steady."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the Lord facilitates demigod worship by empowering them and how demigod deities are images, unlike Krishna's deity which is non-different from Him.

When it comes to the Demigods, the Lord Paramatma has given this special facility to them. Krishna says that one who, anybody who has faith in anybody, I am seated in their heart and I make that faith steady. So to facilitate this kind of even Demigod worship in this material world, the Demigods are given this power to know that there is a Deity of Ganesha being worshipped here. And then that doesn't mean that that Deity body is his. It is an image only. He knows it is an image. Image is different. Just like, you know, ordinary people, you take their photo. Photo is different. I am different. My photo is different. I am different.

But one who has got a spiritual body, there is no difference between him and his photo. That is why even now we keep Prabhupada's photo in the altar. Bhaktisiddhant's photo is in the altar. They are not photos. Because they have a spiritual body, they are non-different from that. They manifest in the substance itself. Just like Krishna manifests in the substance of the body. That is the Deity.

He is very pleased. Oh, you are worshipping me. Okay, I will give you a bonus. Devatas are like that. Devatas know that they are being worshipped in this temple, that temple, that temple. They know that their image is being worshipped. And therefore they are pleased with them.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting the Holy Name is like welcoming the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a VIP, emphasizing the importance of delight, relishing association, and enthusiastic service.

We already said that chanting is like welcoming the Lord. So there's a feeling in welcoming. You delightfully welcome, is it not? If you invite somebody to your house, you delightfully welcome them. Not that you're, you know, like a very, somehow okay, I have to invite them. Not like that. You delightfully invite them. Two ways you can do. Delightfully you can invite them, or some social obligation is there. We have to call them, let them come. No, it's not like that. You have to delightfully call them. So in the same way, the Holy name is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Supreme Personality is no supreme. There's no person superior to Him. So that Supreme Personality of Godhead, we also used another important word which brings out a kind of, we can relate with that feeling. What is that? Like a V-I-P. So infinite V's, I-P. So Krishna is like a I-I-P, most important person, infinitely important person. Suppose in your house someone comes. Let's say somebody whom you admire so much and he is a role model for you. He comes to your house. You will be delighted, not a. You will be delighted to receive him, and you will relish his association. You will want to relish his association. You want to hear from him or you want to relish his association. And then you are going to be very enthusiastic till he leaves, you want to be enthusiastic to serve him. So that, you know, there is a relationship built, there is a pleasure of serving him. So take this, understand these three things: One is delight, delightfully welcoming, relishing the association, enthusiastically serving.

**Key Quote:** "It so happened by the will of the lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of Parikshit Maharaj's actions and attributes them to the will of the Lord.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1, Chapter 18, Text No. 30 SATU BRAMHARSHE RAMSHE GATHASUM URAGAM RUSHA VINIRGACCHAN DHANUSHKOTYA NIDHAYAPURA MAGATAHA Translation and purport by Sriban Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada Translation While leaving, the king, being so insulted, picked up a lifeless snake with his bow and angrily placed it on the shoulder of the sage. Then he returned to his palace. The king thus treated the sage tit-for-tat. Although he was never accustomed to such silly actions, by the will of the lord, the king, while going away, found a dead snake in front of him. And he thought that the sage, who had coldly received him, thus might be coldly rewarded by being offered a garland of a dead snake. In the ordinary course of dealing, this was not very unsightly. It was unnatural. But in the case of Maharaja Pariksit dealing with a brahmana sage, this was certainly unprecedented. It so happened by the will of the lord.

**Key Quote:** "This is the law of reception."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of proper reception, even to enemies, contrasting it with the cold treatment Parikshit Maharaj received.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Parabrahma. So, we have seen in the last few verses that when Pariksit Maharaj entered the ashram of Samika Rishi, who was carrying a knife and bone on his shoulder, who was deeply meditating, who was in complete silence and he was not aware of the externals as to what is happening. In the last verse, we saw that Pariksit Maharaj was hungry and thirsty. And so, he went into the ashram so that he may be received well and he may be offered with water. But here we see that the Shamika Rishi was in deep meditation, was in complete silence and there was no one to receive him. It is said, according to the law of reception, even if an enemy comes to the house, he should be received. He should be offered a good seat. And he should offer him water. Just like we see in the case of, in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, when the Pandavas and Kauravas were fighting like enemies, and soon after the sun set, they were all one. They were all very friendly. In one such instance, Arjuna happened to visit Duryodhana. And Duryodhana considered Arjuna as an enemy. But when he went to his palace, when he meets Duryodhana, Duryodhana welcomes him with all good reception. He offers him good seating. And in fact he says, please tell me what is your desire. I shall fulfill all your desire. This is the law of reception.

**Key Quote:** "Eventually, we will see that the Parikshit was cursed by a sage."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Parikshit Maharaj's anger and its consequences, linking it to the will of the Lord and setting the stage for the recitation of Srimad Bhagavatam.

But here we see in the case of Parikshit Maharaj, who is the emperor of the entire planet, there was no one to receive him. And this is called cold treatment. We also come across people whom we meet, they treat coldly. Is it not? Sometimes we meet people, you know, they treat us very coldly. They don't give a warm reception. No smile on their face. No such pleasantries. So this is called cold treatment. And Parikshit, when he entered, this was his expectation that somebody would receive him. He would offer him some water. And the sage was in complete meditation, in deep meditation. And he was indifferent to what is happening. Therefore this is considered as cold treatment. And Parikshit was upset. It is said in this verse, he became angry. And in anger, he took a lifeless snake which was on the ground and garlanded him on his shoulder. Actually, if this stage was not set up, we would have not sat here and heard Srimad Bhagavatam. Eventually, we will see that Parikshit was cursed by a sage, that he was cursed by a Brahmana boy, that he would die in seven days. And Parikshit, after hearing the curse, he could have contracted, but he did not. And then he gave up his kingdom, goes to Sukadeva Goswami, hears the Bhagavatam. That's why we are all sitting here and hearing Srimad Bhagavatam, because the act of Parikshit was because of the will of the Lord. Prabhupada says in today's Parapat, it happened so because of the will of the Lord.

#### free will, desire, anger, Krishna consciousness

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When his desire is not fulfilled, immediately there is anger."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of free will, its misuse, and how unfulfilled desires lead to anger, connecting it to Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita.

Now, after hearing so much of philosophy in Krishna conscious, we know that every living entity has free will. Is it not? Every living entity has free will. And using this free will, we may use our will, we may misuse our free will. And this misuse of free will is leading us to different destinations of life. Sometimes as human beings, sometimes as animals, sometimes as reptiles, birds, etc. It is very crucial that how we use this free will. Now in the case of Parikshit, he acted according to the will of the Lord. What does it mean? Will of the Lord, what does it mean? It is actually Lord's desire. His will was controlled by the Lord. The pure devotees act according to the will of the Lord, according to the desire of the Lord, according to the mission of the Lord. Whereas our free will, this free will, we are free. We freely act according to our whims, according to our desires. What pleases us, we act. And that's why we are taking birth after birth, in the wheel of material nature. But here, Parikshit acted according to the will of the Lord. His expectation was not fulfilled when he entered the ashram of the sage. And therefore, he becomes angry. In this context, even Krishna also says in the Bhagavad Gita, that how one can become angry? What leads one to become angry? He says in the Bhagavad Gita, when one is contemplating on something material, he becomes attached to it. He wants to fulfill his desire. When his desire is not fulfilled, immediately there is anger. In this context, on the occasion of Sudarshana Jayanti, a similar instance is being described in Srimad Bhagavatam. How, if one's desire is not fulfilled,

**Key Quote:** "He compared this opulence to an insignificant piece of a stone."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the story of Ambarish Maharaj, highlighting his detachment from material opulence despite being a powerful king.

he becomes angry. Once, what happened was, it is given in Srimad Bhagavatam 9th canto, Amrish Maharaj, he was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. He was blessed with all opulence, unlimited opulence. And he was the king of the entire planet. He had good name, fame, position, and everything was under his control. But, he was not attached to anything material, to any of these opulences he was not attached. In fact, he compared this opulence to an insignificant piece of a stone. It is said, Amrish Maharaj, a great devotee of Lord Vasudeva, engaged in the service of the devotees of the Lord, tadbhakteshu ca sadhusu. And he compared this Vishwam, prapto bhavam param vishwam, he compared this entire universe, entire Vishwam, enidam lostravat smrtham. He compared to an inauspicious, insignificant piece of a stone. In other words, although he was ruling the entire universe, entire planet, he was not at all attached. He was completely detached to all his opulences. Imagine, if we get that opportunity of material opulence, lot of wealth, name, fame, position, what will happen to us? What will happen to us, if we get all these opulences? Hmm? We become attached to it. And because of which, we will not be able to remember the Lord. We will not be able to remember Krishna. Because of opulence, we become pride. We become immersed in sense gratification.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "No time."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about someone who forgot God after being blessed with opulence, illustrating the dangers of attachment and sense gratification.

I remember, when I was travelling to Hyderabad, there was a co-passenger. He was telling that he used to visit temples every day and praying to the Lord, that he be blessed with good wealth, good family, children, position. He was praying for it. And when he was blessed with all opulence, all wealth, good business, good family, he was completely absorbed in it. And he was not visiting temple. He was not thanking the Lord. I asked him, why are you not going to the temple now? He said, no time. He was completely attached. He was immersed in sense gratification. That's why Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, bhogaishwariya prasaktanam. Anyone who is attached to bhoga and aishwarya, what happens? daya pratachetasaam vyavasayatmika buddhihi samadhaunavidiyate The determination to worship the Lord, to please the Lord, does not take place, because he is completely absorbed in sense gratification. Whereas devotees feel, the opulence is an obstacle, because it tends to forget the Lord. It makes us forget the Lord. The opulence makes us forget the Lord. Just like we see in the case of Sudhama, was a poor brahmana. He was in poverty stricken, but he was always remembering the Lord. In all circumstances, he was remembering the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Pandavas' devotion amidst adversity with the previous example, emphasizing the importance of remembering God in all situations.

Even the Pandavas, who were the rightful owners of the property, but they were deprived of their own property. Prosperity, they were completely deprived. But still they were remembering the Lord in all circumstances. They had so many difficulties, so many challenges, but still they were remembering the Lord. They became exalted devotees of Lord Krishna. So although, Amrish Maharaj had all these opulences, he never forgot the Lord. He was always engaging his senses in the service of the Lord. He was completely absorbed in the service of the Lord. 24 hours, he was remembering the Lord. Now one may question, how is it possible to remember the Lord always? 24 hours always, engaging our senses in the service of the Lord 24 hours.

How is it possible? Here is an example of Amrish Maharaj. How he remembered the Lord always? It is said, he engaged himself, his mind, always in meditating upon the Lord, upon the lotus feet of the Lord. He engaged his mind in meditation upon the lotus feet of the Lord. His words in describing the glories of the Lord. His hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord. His ears in hearing the glories of the Lord spoken by the devotees. His eyes in seeing the beauty of the Lord. His senses, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of pure devotees. He engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of the tulsi leaves offered to the Lord. His tongue in tasting Krishna Prasadam. This we don't forget. And his lips and legs in walking to the holy places of the Lord. His head in bowing before the Lord. Like this he engaged his senses in the service of the Lord, 24 hours. All his desires he engaged in the service of the Lord. It is said, indeed Amrish Maharaj was completely absorbed in the service of the Lord, 24 hours.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that a devotee possesses all good qualities and cannot be defeated by mystic power, describing Durvasa Muni's anger and the creation of a demon, but Ambarish Maharaj remains undisturbed.

And Prabhupada says A devotee cannot be defeated By so called mystic yogi A devotee cannot be defeated By so called mystic yogi Because he possess all good qualities of the lord He possess all good qualities of the lord It is said in Bhagavatam aisyasti bhaktir bhagavati akinchana sarvaer gunes tatrasamasatesuraah sarvaer gunes tatrasamasatesuraah Any one Who is worshipping the supreme lord Vishnu He posses all good qualities of devats all guanas of devates and the other hand, the non-devotees, the non-devotees possess no good qualities, but they are driven by mental speculation. They are driven by mental speculation. And that's why Prabhupada says that devotees cannot be defeated. And Durvasa Muni becomes red, his face becomes red with anger. He took a bunch of hair from his head and creates a demon from it. And this demon was blazing fire of devastation. He was resembling like a blazing fire of devastation who could destroy the entire. And he comes before the king. And the king was undisturbed. He did not move an inch from his position. He was not at all afraid, nor he was praying for the Lord for protection. He was not at all afraid. Prahalad, his father harassed him, tortured him, put him in the midst of snakes, put him in the midst of elephants, put him in the fire of, you know, burning oil, boiling oil. He was not at all afraid. He was just remembering the Lord. Imagine if such creature comes before us, what would happen to the entire hall. Everybody would run away. Is it not? But Amrish Maharaj was undisturbed because, it is said that devotees are Narayana Paraha. That devotees are Narayana Paraha sarve, naku taschyanabhibhi merging. Had there beencentury of Devotees, if theancre would not have happened, whatever happens, it would have been forever, is it not? Right? Amrish Maharaj was undisturbed. As he was running. My answer to this question is that devotees need to be deploy nearly 10,000 years ago to remain

**Key Quote:** "But eventually Japa is a relationship with Krishna."
**Summary:** Japa is presented as a process that evolves into a relationship with Krishna through chanting and hearing the Hare Krishna mantra.

I said Japa is not merely a process. Japa for a beginner, it is a process because he has to align his mind and senses, all those things, towards the right way of Japa. But eventually, Japa is a relationship with Krishna. In two hours you're sitting and chanting, it's a relationship with Krishna, just like you go and sit near your loved ones and spend time. The same way we spend time talking to Krishna because today, spiritually, we do not know any other spiritual vocabulary. We are not awakened, so only one vocabulary we know today, which the Guru has given us. What is it? Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. This is our talk with Krishna, sound incarnation. God says that's good enough. Just go on chanting.

In the prison in the country, very nicely you are running the prison. You understand who is the superintendent, who is the controller. He is the controller and all this. It is all dry.

Even Shanta Rasa is so wonderful for a Rasa-starved living entity in this material world. Even Sakya Rasa, even Shanta Rasa, where there is no active exchange of relationship, but there is appreciating Rasa of the greatness of the Supreme Lord, His creation.

Our highest Rasa is also our original Rasa. In the material world, we run after this Rasa, that Rasa, so many Rasas.

And when this happened, the Brahmana, because he was a qualified Brahmana, qualified Brahmana means they would not take up any sort of employment. They would dedicate their life for learning the Vedas. They would always walk the path of truth and austerity. And they would have controlled all their senses. They would not engage in sense gratification. And these were all the good qualities of a Brahmana. So this Brahmana was also a qualified person. And when his child died immediately, he went to the assembly of the Yadavas and he spoke to the king, Ugrasena, as well as all the other Yadava members present in that assembly.

He said, how is it that when the father is alive, the son can die? Actually, as per the Vedic civilization, the king is responsible for ensuring that Dharma is followed in the country. If the ruler is Dharmic, then it is expected that the citizens will also follow the codes of Dharma very properly. And by this, the whole civilization would be very peaceful and things would be very stable in the society. There would be no extremes in climate. The winters will be pleasing. The summers will also be pleasing. There would be no natural calamities like earthquakes and floods and drought and such other. Natural calamities would not occur. It was only when the king would become Adharmic, when he would become sinful, then all these kind of disturbance in the society would happen. Not only that, even it was expected that in the Vedic civilization, a father, when he would die, his son would perform the last rites and he would do all the rituals of cremation. And by so doing, the father will get delivered from any sinful activities which will not allow him to take a next birth. So those who are extremely sinful, when they die, they don't get a next birth immediately. They will get a ghostly body. And so such people will have to suffer for some time in those ghostly bodies until their karma gets burnt out and then they will get another body.

**Key Quote:** "Because we have to understand that this body that we have consists of a subtle and a gross body. The gross body consists of the hands, eyes, ears, legs etc. Subtle body consists of mind, intelligence and false ego."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the suffering of a ghostly body, explaining how the unfulfilled desires of the subtle body (mind, intelligence, and false ego) cause distress when there is no gross body to act upon them.

So why is a ghostly body a suffering? Because we have to understand that this body that we have consists of a subtle and a gross body. The gross body consists of the hands, eyes, ears, legs etc. Subtle body consists of mind, intelligence and false ego. So when a person becomes a ghost, what happens is he does not have a gross body, but he has a subtle body consisting of mind, intelligence and false ego. Now, with the subtle body, there are so many desires that are stored in the subtle body. The desire to eat, taste some nice food, desire to hear some good music, desire to see some beautiful object, desire to touch some soft object etc. So now, when a person does not have a gross body, those desires, there is no way that those desires can get fulfilled. So imagine, you are chained up completely, your hands, legs, everything is tied up and you cannot see, you cannot hear, you cannot do anything. What kind of situation it will be? It will be very, very torturous situation. So when a person becomes a ghost, that's what happens with him. All his desires are there, but he does not have a gross body through which he can fulfill those desires. So it is a very distressful condition. Nobody wants to be in that condition.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how performing last rites, Pindadana, and Shraddha ceremonies can help ancestors avoid a ghostly existence, highlighting the anomaly of a son dying before his father in Vedic society.

So if a person has committed some sinful activity by which he is going to get a ghostly body, if he has a son and the son performs the last rites, and also the son performs the Pindadana, from every year, the Shraddha ceremony that is done, if annually that is done for the forefather, then the father and the mother will get saved from any sort of that kind of ghostly situation they might get into. So naturally, according to the Vedic civilization, it was expected that a person would get old and when his lifespan is got over, he would give up his body and his next generation, the son would come and perform the last rites. Now here was a situation, before the father is done, the son is dying, which was completely unheard of in the Vedic civilization. Nowadays it might be a very common affair, but in those days it was not so.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of the Brahmana repeatedly accusing the Yadava kings of Adharma after the death of each of his sons, culminating in Arjuna's intervention.

It was considered an anomaly that a person dies young. Everybody was expected to grow old and finish all his duties and then he had to die. So this Brahmana came to the assembly of the kings, Yadava kings, and he started accusing them of not following the principles of Dharma. He accused them saying that you are all simply in the dress of kings you are sitting here, but you are not performing your duties, you have become sense gratifiers and that is how such adharmic things are happening. Like this, he expressed his anger and the Yadava kings, they were all quiet and he walked back. After some time, his wife gave birth to a second son and when the second son took birth, the same incident repeated. The boy was born, healthy baby, live and a few minutes after he takes birth, he dies. Again, the Brahmana came to the assembly and he accused the kings and he alleged that because of their dereliction of the principles of Dharma, these kind of mishappenings were taking place. His intention was at least now the kings should rectify themselves so that these things do not happen. And he went back. Now like this, it went on. Once, twice, thrice, four times, five times. Ninth time, when the ninth son also died like this, the Brahmana again came to the assembly and he accused the Yadava kings. And it was the ninth time when he came to the assembly to accuse the Yadavas that Arjuna also happened to be there. And when Arjuna heard the Brahmana accusing like this, he went to the Brahmana and asked him, What has happened? Why are you accusing the kings like this?

**Summary:** Arjuna promises the Brahmana protection for his tenth child, boasting of his prowess and even mentioning his victory over Lord Shiva to obtain the Pashupatastra, despite the Brahmana's skepticism.

And then the Brahmana narrated his whole ordeal to Arjuna. So then Arjuna told him, Please don't worry. I am neither Krishna nor Sankarsana. I am Arjuna. I am Arjuna, the holder of the Gandiva. So it looks like there are no Kshatriyas in this assembly. There is not even somebody who can at least put on a show of being a Kshatriya. At least somebody who can hold up a bow and arrow in their hand and stand next to you. Looks like there is nobody like that. But don't worry. I am Arjuna. I am there with you and I will come and I will give you all protection. So this Brahmana looked at Arjuna and he laughed at him and said, Arjuna, what are you talking? Krishna and Balarama themselves are there. They are not able to do anything. What can you do? Then Arjuna said, No, no, no. Don't think, you know, I am... What you said is right. I am neither Krishna nor I am Sankarsana nor am I Aniruddha, Pradyumna. I am not any of them. I am Arjuna. I have defeated Lord Shiva and I have got the Pashupatastra from him. So Shiva is Mahadeva and he is the Lord of all the Devatas and I have fought with him. So please come. I will protect you. And I assure you, if I am not able to protect your tenth child, then I will enter flame and give up my body. So the Brahmana said, Okay, if you are so confident. Anyway, let us go. Anyway, let us see. And so the Brahmana went back.

**Summary:** Arjuna prepares to protect the Brahmana's tenth child, but despite his efforts, the child disappears immediately after birth, leading to the Brahmana's disappointment and Arjuna's determination not to give up.

Now Arjuna, because he had given this kind of promise to the Brahmana, he also did not move out of Dwaraka. He stayed in Dwaraka only. So after about nine, ten months or whatever time it takes, the Brahmana again came to the assembly and he informed Arjuna, Oh Arjuna, my wife is pregnant and she is about to deliver a child. So I want to remind you of your promise. Please come and protect my child. My child who is going to be born. So then immediately Arjuna equipped himself with his Gandiva bow and with his arrows and fully put on his armor, coat of mail and all those kind of things. And he went with the Brahmana to his house. And there he invoked this Pashupatastra and with that arrow he covered the entire house from all directions. And then he fixed one more arrow and stood there waiting to see who is going to come into the house and tried to take away this child of the Brahmana. And now the time came for the lady to deliver the child. And the tenth child was born. And this was also a son. And the son was born very healthy, crying and all that. And everybody was so happy. The father also lifted the child. He saw the child. A minute later, suddenly that wall of, that fortress of arrows that Arjuna had built, had made around the house. Suddenly they all disappeared. And along with that the tenth child was born. That child also disappeared. Now the Brahmana came to Arjuna and he told, What a fool I was. I went and believed you. What Krishna and Balaram could not achieve, what you can achieve. I could not, I did not have the brains to think of this, to think this much. Everything is gone. So he became very disheartened.

**Summary:** Arjuna searches for the missing child in various realms, including Yama Loka, Indra Loka, and Brahma Loka, but fails to find him, leading him to accept defeat and prepare to fulfill his promise to enter fire.

But Arjuna was not going to give up. He immediately told the Brahmana, No, no, wait. I am not going to give up so easily. He took up his bow and arrow and using the mystic powers that he had, he travelled to Yama Loka. And he approached Yama Raj and demanded, I want the son of the Brahmana who has been, who has just now disappeared. I want him back. Yama Raj informed him, You know, I am not aware of this. Although I am the lord of death, I keep track of everybody who is dying. But I don't have any record of this individual you are telling. This person has not been brought here. So Arjuna was astonished. He thought, okay, he is not in Yama Loka. Let me go to Indra Loka and try. He went to Indra Loka. He searched there. He could not find him. So he thought maybe some Asura has taken him away. And he went to the Patala Loka, Rasa Tala, Tala Tala. All those places he went. Even there he could not find. So then he thought, let me try on the higher planets. He went all the way up to Brahma Loka, which is the topmost planet in this universe. Even there he could not find. So practically from Brahma Loka down to Rasa Tala and all those lowermost planets, Arjuna went to every planet and he could not find the son of the Brahmana. Now what to do? Finally Arjuna was, he had to accept defeat. So he came back to Dwaraka and he informed the Brahmana, I am sorry. I have failed.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna immediately came forward and he told, Arjuna, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are you giving up your body? I am still there. No, don't worry. We will find the sons of the Brahmana."
**Summary:** Krishna intervenes to stop Arjuna from giving up his life and takes him on a transcendental chariot journey beyond the universe, using the Sudarsana Chakra to illuminate the path.

And as per my promise, I am going to enter a fire and I am going to give up my body. Now this whole while Krishna was watching whatever was happening. Because when Arjuna, you know, took that confident step and he said, No, forget Krishna, Balarama and all that. I will come. Like that when he went. Krishna thought, okay, let him try. And Krishna was watching the whole fun. But now when the situation became such that Arjuna is going to die, then Krishna immediately came forward and he told, Arjuna, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why are you giving up your body? I am still there. No, don't worry. We will find the sons of the Brahmana. So like that Krishna called for his transcendental chariot. Krishna's chariot was drawn by four horses. So these four horses, Shaibya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa and Balahaka. One of them was greenish in color. One was grayish. Another was white. And another was like the dark red. Like the dark rain bearing cloud. So these four horses, they are all transcendental horses. Anything associated with Krishna is not of this material world. So Krishna brought forth his chariot and he seated Arjuna. And then Krishna took the chariot. And they went in the chariot. Where did they go? They crossed all the planetary systems. They went even beyond Brahmaloka. And they came to the edge of the universe. And when they came to the edge of the universe, it was completely dark. And so the horses stopped a little bit. They hesitated to go further to cross over the covering of the universe. So then what Krishna did? Krishna sent the Sudarsana Chakra. And the Sudarsana immediately illuminated the whole path. And Sudarsana went ahead. And behind them Krishna's chariot carrying Krishna and Arjuna. So if a horse has to travel in outer space, it is not possible. But these horses were not ordinary horses. They were transcendental horses. So they were not dependent on material conditions that they need oxygen. They cannot survive in vacuum. They cannot survive the radiation in outer space. The Van Allen belt they cannot cross. None of those problems were there. They were completely transcendental. And so they crossed over.

**Key Quote:** "And when you cross the covering of the universe, we have the one huge water body, which is known as the river which separates the material universe from the spiritual universe. This river is called the Viraja river."
**Summary:** Krishna and Arjuna cross the Viraja river, which separates the material and spiritual universes, and arrive at an opulent palace made of precious gems.

And they pierced the covering of the universe and crossed that also. And when you cross the covering of the universe, we have the one huge water body, which is known as the river which separates the material universe from the spiritual universe. This river is called the Viraja river. It is also known as Karana Udaka. It is also known as the causal ocean, because that ocean is the source from where all the universes emanate from Mahavishnu. So it is also called an ocean because even though it is a river, it is so vast it is practically like an ocean. Now Arjuna saw that in the middle of that ocean, there was a wonderful palace, huge palace. And Krishna took his chariot closer towards the palace. And when they came to the palace, Arjuna saw that this palace was not an ordinary one. In this world, we see palaces made of sandstone or they may be made of granite or maximum they may be made of wax. They may be made of valuable marble. But this palace, all its columns, ornate columns, were all made up of valuable diamonds, valuable gems like topaz and all such very very emerald and all those kind of valuable gems it was made up of. You can imagine. They are using for the columns and the walls and the flooring all emerald and topaz and diamonds and all that. What kind of opulence must be there? So Arjuna was completely taken aback. He was really struck by the opulence of this place. And everywhere there were very beautiful servants, male and female servants running here and there, carrying many things, carrying out various tasks. And all of them were decorated with very valuable gold ornaments.

**Summary:** Inside the palace, Arjuna sees Ananta Shesha with Mahavishnu lying on him and Lakshmi Devi at his feet, becoming awestruck and following Krishna's example in offering obeisances.

So it was really opulent. And then Krishna took Arjuna and went, entered inside the palace. And when they entered inside the palace, Arjuna saw suddenly, there was this huge serpent. And this serpent, his whole, his neck was bluish and the rest of his body was white like milk. And on the top of his, he had about a more than a thousand hoods. And on each of the hood, there was a valuable diamond glittering and it was spreading. It was spreading an effulgence all around. And now that snake in its coils, it was standing upright with its hood spread out. And on the coils of that serpent, Arjuna saw Mahavishnu lying down and with Lakshmi Devi at his lotus feet. So the moment Arjuna saw this magnificent, this one, magnificent scene of Ananta Shesha, that serpent was Ananta Shesha and Mahavishnu lying on him, he was completely awestruck. And generally what happens when we approach for the first time some very elevated personality, some very eminent personality, sometimes what happens is, we lose the presence of our mind. We don't know what to do. So Arjuna became like that. He did not know what to do. He was standing awestruck. And he was blinking like this. Now Krishna saw, Arjuna does not know what to do. So Krishna thought, okay, instead of telling him what to do, because in that instance, if you tell somebody something, it will not register in their mind also. So Krishna thought, let me do something by which he will also follow. So immediately Krishna offered his obeisances to Mahavishnu. And Arjuna saw, Krishna is offering obeisances, then Arjuna also offered obeisances.

**Summary:** Mahavishnu reveals that he took the Brahmana's sons to have darshan of Krishna and Arjuna, acknowledging their incarnations to protect Dharma and destroy demonic principles, and instructs them to return to the spiritual world after completing their mission.

And then Krishna got up. And when Krishna and Arjuna got up, then Mahavishnu started speaking. So Mahavishnu told Krishna and Arjuna, what did he tell? So he said, O Krishna and Arjuna, I only took away all the ten sons of the Brahmana. I took away the sons of the Brahmana. Now why? Because I wanted to see both of you. I wanted to have a darshan of both of you. And who are you two? So you both in Kali Yuga, you have taken incarnation along with all your plenary portions. You have taken incarnation along with all your plenary portions. Why you have taken incarnation? To protect the principles of Dharma. And not only that, not only protection of the principles of Dharma, Bharasuran, you are also going to destroy all the asuras, the demoniac principles, the atheistic principles. So all the people who do not surrender to Vishnu, you have descended to vanquish them, to annihilate them. So and then Lord Vishnu said, So please finish your business and very quickly go back to the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "So actually Srila Prabhupada explains that this shows that Krishna is superior even to Maha Vishnu. So much so that without Krishna's desire, even Maha Vishnu could not have darshan of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that this story illustrates Krishna's superiority to Mahavishnu, as Mahavishnu had to orchestrate the situation to have Krishna's darshan, implying that even Vishnu needs Krishna's permission.

So this incident is very illustrative. So now if Vishnu wanted to see Krishna and Arjuna, he could have simply gone to, he went to Dwaraka all the way to take away the ten sons of the Brahmana. So he could have just gone to the assembly and seen Krishna, no? Why he had to take away the sons of the Brahmana and force Krishna and Arjuna to come and meet him in the Viraja river? Why did he have to do that? So actually Srila Prabhupada explains that this shows that Krishna is superior even to Maha Vishnu. So much so that without Krishna's desire, even Maha Vishnu could not have darshan of Krishna. You were your Dhritarakshana. Maha Vishnu was desirous of having darshan of Krishna but he did not have Krishna's permission. So what to do now? He, you know, when in Hindi there is a saying, When you are not able to take ghee with your straight finger, then you have to twist your finger and take out. Meaning, when a straightforward way fails to achieve some objective, then you have to think of some convoluted plan. So when in a straightforward way, when Lord Vishnu could not have darshan of Krishna, so he thought, let me do something by which Krishna will be forced to come to me. And so he took away the sons of the Brahmana. And then, even then Krishna did not grant his audience to Maha Vishnu. Finally, when Arjuna's life came into question, then Krishna said, okay, I will go and give darshan to Vishnu. That is how Krishna directly, he took Arjuna to Maha Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "So the reason for that is number one, because Arjuna did not know what to do. He was standing dumbstruck. So Krishna set an example for him."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Krishna offered obeisances to Mahavishnu, stating that it was to set an example for Arjuna and because Krishna and Mahavishnu are not ultimately different, with Krishna being the source of all Vishnu incarnations.

So then the question arises, if Krishna is superior to Maha Vishnu, then why did Krishna offer his obeisances to Maha Vishnu? So the reason for that is number one, because Arjuna did not know what to do. He was standing dumbstruck. So Krishna set an example for him. Just like sometimes children, when they are studying ABCD in the classroom, the children don't know how to write ABCD. They are just learning. So the teacher takes a chalk, and she turns the chalk and writes A like this. That does not mean teacher is learning how to write ABCD. No, teacher knows much more than ABCD. She knows words, she knows sentences, she knows grammar. So many things the teacher knows. But for teaching, the teacher may take the role of a student. Similarly, Krishna wanted to demonstrate to Arjuna what he has to do. And so he personally did it. And so like this, Krishna, and not only that, Krishna and Maha Vishnu in one sense are not different. So Krishna offers his obeisances to Maha Vishnu also. So it is Krishna offering obeisances to himself. So that way also if you see, it is not incongruous. So even the shastras also mention that the Vishnu's incarnations, they are all incarnations, and Krishna is the source of all those incarnations. You have, this is explained in the in the Vishnu Purana, as well as in the Srimad Bhagavatam, even in the Bhagavad Gita, everywhere this is clearly described that Vishnu is an incarnation of Lord Krishna.

**Summary:** Mahavishnu, pleased with having darshan of Krishna, returns the Brahmana's sons, and Krishna and Arjuna return them to their father, concluding the story and setting up the next episode by questioning how Arjuna fought with Lord Shiva.

And so like this, the Maha Vishnu was very satisfied to have darshan of Lord Krishna because to have darshan of Lord Krishna is so rare. Even Vishnu doesn't get that opportunity very frequently. So Maha Vishnu, when having got pleased with having darshan of Lord Krishna, he returned the ten sons of the Brahmanas. Now the first son was already grown up to ten years. The next was nine years like that. Some of them were grown up and the most recent was still a baby. So carrying all of them, Krishna and Arjuna came back and handed over all the sons back to the Brahmana. And so this was how the incident was, this incident took place in Varaka and Krishna showed his supreme position to even Arjuna. And so Arjuna understood that, understood the glories of Krishna like this. And so now it is interesting to note that how Arjuna informed the Brahmana that he had fought with even Lord Shiva and he had won the Pashupatastra from him. So how did this happen? Please join us in our next episode to learn about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna Jagat Guru Shri Ila Prabhupada Ki Jai Netai Gor Premanande

How the holy name has been, you know, Nama Avatara is guiding, doing so many wonderful things. Just like always, I cannot forget that it is Nama Prabhu's Leela, this Hare Krishna temple came up. It was His Leela. Materially incalculable that we could have ever done all these things. We were all young, hardly 35 years old when we started this construction. I was the oldest. What experience we had? We had no experience at all in the material world. Straight out of the college, we walked into the temple. We have no idea of what is fundraising, nothing. It's all miraculously the holy name manifested and here, an unbelievable iconic temple stood up in the matter of just nine years. This is Nama Prabhu's Leela.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Japa Yajna (chanting) in building the temple and establishing it as a center for spreading Krishna consciousness, Prasadam distribution, and the holy name.

Because I used to make everybody chant 16 rounds, including I used to sit in that shed, temporary temple on the Hare Krishna hill. Before 10 o'clock, before Prasadam, you have to finish your rounds. They all finished their rounds. It is the Japa Yajna that built this temple. Build this temple means what? We are not talking about structure. We are talking about a center for spreading Krishna consciousness, which is attracting today, you know, 10, 10, 15, 20,000 people, you know, weekends. Every day, 7, 8,000 people. So it is not a small thing. It's a center for spreading Krishna consciousness, center for spreading Prasadam distribution, holy name.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of creating 108 steps for chanting and how, despite initial doubts, it became a successful Harinam distribution initiative.

Nama Prabhu's another Leela. I had made those steps in front of those who have come to Hare Krishna hill in front of Narasimha temple. I had made 108 steps where people have to go through those 108 steps, stand on each step and Prabhupada's Hare Krishna chanting will be loudly played and they should chant. They follow Prabhupada's chanting. That's not the Japa one. Little slower chanting is there in Prabhupada's. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. That speed only chanting is there. The new people, they come, they hear Prabhupada chant 108 times and they come inside. So when I just made those steps, those stones, those steps, then somehow or the other I told some devotees, why don't you let us start that? Nobody was inclined to start that. Nobody said, no, nobody will go, Prabhu. Nobody will go through that. Everybody wants to have quick darshan. Nobody will go, nobody will go. So I was very depressed. I said, how can we, you know, so much nice, nice granite steps was made, enclosure was made and it's a failure, not happening. Then somehow or the other, this is our mental blocks we have. Then I said, just, just, just do it. Just do it. And today you see, every day out of 8000 people, at least 2000 people are chanting one round Hare Krishna Mahamantra and walking into Narasimha temple. Big Harinam distribution in this area.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Maharaj explains that the root of suffering is forgetfulness of Krishna and identifying with the material body, which is a form of punishment, while true happiness lies in loving God.

You mentioned about punishment and pleasure. In our normal understanding, punishment is involved with some pain. How do we recognize the pain involved in this punishment? Good question. The living entity in this material world, the soul of the living entity, actually is in pain. He's suffering. He's thinking that he's not suffering, but actually he's suffering, so it is a punishment. What is that? Forgetfulness of Krishna. He thinks he's a body. If I think I am the body, it's a punishment. This body is limited in so many ways: birth, death, old age, disease. Isn't it the punishment to misidentify yourself? You're divine. The soul is divine, beautiful ego, servant of Krishna, capable of loving Krishna. So is this not a punishment, forgetfulness of? Yes, so this is a punishment. Pleasure to keep you okay, keep you going here, little little pleasure, sense pleasures. This is not what your entitlement. You're a miser. You know what you're entitled to? Your soul, soul is entitled for the happiness of love of God, and you're missing that.

**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the two key elements of effective chanting: undiluted attention and undiluted intention, focusing on associating with the Lord.

With two things in mind. One is, I should give uninterrupted attention. That means attention should not go anywhere. Attention should not get diluted. Undiluted attention.

And attention breakers are, what is the famous attention breaker? Thinking. Thinking is attention breaker. So without thinking, if you can hear Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, that alone is not enough. You should have undiluted intention. Why you should have undiluted intention? Why are you chanting? Forgetting mystic power? Or forgetting association of the Lord as well as mystic power? Then dilution will happen.

You have an intention. What is that intention? Something for you. You have an intention, isn't it? Similarly, tendency of the mind is to actually when you are chanting Hare Krishna, something I have to get. Instead, we should simply think, I just want to associate with this Sachidananda Vigraha who is, Shabdavigraha who is before me. Just want to associate. So that consciousness, undiluted attention and undiluted intention. Undiluted attention is a negative thing. We are saying it should not be diluted, but where should the attention be?

**Summary:** This section emphasizes the importance of practicing undiluted attention and intention in chanting, highlighting it as a foundation for soulful japa and comparing it to Dhruva Maharaj's gradual process.

Nama. The intention to associate and please the Lord. That should be the intention of the Nama, the positive intention. It should not be undiluted by, it should not be diluted by intention for this one, that one, so many other things. It should not be diluted. So if we can chant, this is what we should practice. This is soulful japa. This is the foundation of soulful japa. Then bhavanas are there. That is a different thing. Bhavanas have to naturally come. Or bhavanas have, bhavana should not, our feelings or bhavana in the background, it should only be in the background. Foreground should be completely absorbed in chanting uninterruptedly with undiluted intention for the association of the Lord. So we also have got a big deal. Dhruva Maharaj is taking a lot of tapasya. It didn't happen overnight. Not that he decided and said, I am going to do this. Suddenly he went into this state. No! Six months standing, then he attained that perfection. Similarly, simply today, if you decide, I want to do uninterrupted, undiluted japa. It's not an instant decision. Okay, today's round, undiluted. You should do everyday's japa, you should try to do uninterrupted and undiluted intention. We should do, but you should know it is a process.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by explaining that associating with the Lord gives a higher taste, diminishing lower desires, and that this process, aided by the mercy of the guru and Krishna, purifies consciousness.

I'll go on like this. More and more we associate with the Lord, the Lord gives us the attraction for uninterrupted. Lord gives us the higher taste by which all the lower taste intentions are, all lower taste different intentions, so you lose all your lower taste by the association of the Lord. So it's a process, continuous process and this is what the tapasya that the devotee has to do. Earlier also one paragraph talked about how the bhakti yogi, a small boy, could achieve this because he was meditating and the Lord helped him. He is not like an impersonalist meditation. He got a guru. Dhruva Maharaj got a guru. Naradarshi gave him the mantra and all those things. So there is a guru and Krishna's help is there. Therefore he became, very quickly attained this tapasya. Similarly, we also have Prabhupada's mercy and Namaprabhu's mercy. By their mercy, this tapasya of uninterrupted giving uninterrupted attention to the Lord with undiluted attention, our intention, our japa will keep progressing and progressing and progressing with the help of Namaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada, guru and Krishna's mercy. So our consciousness becomes, our chitta becomes completely pure, that contaminated consciousness becomes.

**Key Quote:** "That supreme personality of godhead is the only shelter of everyone."
**Summary:** The Lord is the only shelter, and seeking protection elsewhere is foolish, like holding a dog's tail to cross the ocean.

om namo bhagavate vasudevaya reading from Srimad Bhagavatam canto 6 chapter 9, the appearance of demon Vritrasura, text number 22: avismitam tam paripurnakamam sve nai valabhena samam prashantam translation and purport by his divine grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada translation: Free from all materialism, translation of the existence of existence and never one destructs by anything, the Lord is always jubilant and fully satisfied by his own spiritual perfection. He has no material designations and therefore he is steady and unattached. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only shelter of everyone. Anyone desiring to be protected by others is certainly a great fool who desires to cross the sea by holding the tail of a dog. A dog can swim in the water, but if a dog dives in the ocean and someone wants to cross the ocean by holding the dog's tail, he is certainly fool number one. A dog cannot cross the ocean nor can a person cross the ocean by catching a dog's tail. Similarly, one who desires to cross the ocean of nisscience should not seek the shelter of any demigod or anyone else,

but the fearless shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srimad Bhagavatam 10th canto, 14th chapter, 58th verse therefore says, "The Lord's lotus feet are an indestructible boat." Anyone takes shelter of that boat, he can easily cross the ocean of nisscience. Consequently, there are no dangers for a devotee although he lives within this material world which is full of dangers at every step. One should seek the shelter of the all-powerful in the Lord, instead of trying to be protected by one's own concocted ideas. Thus ends the bhaktivinanda purport.

**Key Quote:** "Among the topmost sinful action is killing a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The story of Indra offending his spiritual master, taking Vishwaroopa as a priest, Vishwaroopa secretly offering oblations to demons, and Indra killing him, incurring the sin of Brahma Hatya.

This material world is a very strange place. Some really funny things happen just like it is described in this chapter. What happened? Indra offended his spiritual master Brahaspati. So Brahaspati silently walked out, walked away and Indra is without his guru. So then he searched for his guru. He could not find him. Then he went to Brahma and said what do I do now? Brahma said you foolish fellow, why did you offend your spiritual master? Anyway, now take another Brahmana, Vishwaroopa, for performing your sacrifices. The demigods constantly have to keep performing sacrifices. Otherwise, they can lose their position. They have to maintain their position by doing their duty of offering sacrifices constantly to the Supreme Lord. So Indra requested Vishwaroopa, another Brahmana, to help him perform his sacrifices. And Vishwaroopa was doing the duty very nicely. But, Vishwaroopa happened to be related to the demigods from his father's side and to the demons from his mother's side. And therefore, he had some affection for both the demigods and the demons. So while performing sacrifice on behalf of Indra, Vishwaroopa, he would offer ablations, idam indraya svaha, idam agnaya svaha. Loudly he would chant the mantras, offering ablations to the devatas, giving them their share. But secretly, he would offer ablations to the demons also, because he had some affection for the demons. One day Indra came to know about it and suddenly, Indra became very very angry. He is appointed by me, by the devatas, and he is secretly offering ablations to the demons, our enemies. So being afraid that the demons may anytime overpower the devatas and even lose their position, Indra in a fit of anger, he cut off Vishwaroopa's head. He killed him. Instantly killed him. And then, the sinful reaction of killing a Brahmana, Brahma Hatya, of all the kinds of sinful activities anybody can commit, among the topmost sinful action is killing a Brahmana, Brahma Hatya. So this Brahma Hatya reaction, even though Indra could have counteracted,

**Key Quote:** "Some mistake in the chanting, the meaning can be completely opposite."
**Summary:** Vishwaroopa's father, Tvashta, performs a sacrifice to create someone to kill Indra, but a mistake in chanting the mantra empowers Indra instead, leading to the birth of the demon Vritrasura.

he decided he is going to accept the reaction. So he did severe tapasya to actually become free from that reaction. And meantime, this Vishwaroopa's father, Tvashta, he became very angry against Indra. My son was doing some service and some misunderstanding and this Indra has killed my son. So he performed another sacrifice in order to create some being who will be able, competent to kill Indra, because Indra is no ordinary person. It's not easy to kill Indra like that. So he performed one sacrifice. And in that sacrifice, he was chanting mantras intended to generate a person powerful enough to kill Indra. So Indra Shatro Viverdhasva, O enemy of Indra, may you become powerful enough to be able to kill Indra. But in chanting the mantra, he made a mistake and the mantra's meaning became enemy of Indra. No. Do that. Indra who is an enemy. Instead of enemy of Indra, it became Indra who is an enemy. This is Sanskrit language. It's very very, you know, precisely it has to be chanted. Some mistake in the chanting, the meaning can be completely opposite. And enemy of Indra changed to Indra who is an enemy. May he become powerful. So all the mantras he was offering, so instead of empowering the creature who is going to be born powerful enough to kill Indra, he was empowering Indra whom he intended to kill. So this, this sacrifice, from this sacrifice was born one demon, Vritrasura. And this Vritrasura was such a fearful demon, and everybody was afraid of this demon. And Indra decided that this demon has to be killed immediately. Otherwise he will do so much of harm. But Indra's weapons were totally useless. They were not adequate for killing this Vritrasura. And then all the demigods sought shelter of Vishnu, and they offered nice prayers. So one of the prayers is here in this 22nd verse.

**Key Quote:** "Free from all material conceptions of existence."
**Summary:** The demigods glorify the Lord as free from material conceptions, contrasting Vaishnava and Mayavadi interpretations of scriptures regarding the Lord's qualities.

So what is the prayer the demigods are offering? Free from all material conceptions of existence. They are glorifying the Lord. What is the Lord's position? That the Lord is free from all material conceptions of existence. That the Lord is free from all material concepts. Paripurnakaamam avismitam tam paripurnakaamam svenaivalaabhena samamprasantam. So, even though in the Upanishads, many places, the Lord is described also as a person, and the living entity is also a person. Both are spirit. But still, there are so many differences between the Supreme Lord and the living entity under all circumstances in all conditions. So the differences are also pointed out in the scriptures, in the original Vedas, in the Upanishads but the Mayavadis interpret those portions conveniently to support their Mayavada theory or philosophy. But the Vaishnavas, they don't interpret. So they take it as it is and consequently the Vaishnava's understanding is the living entity has got similar qualities as that of the Lord but still there are differences, similarities and differences and that's how Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has presented the Achintya Bheda Abheda Tattva, the philosophy of oneness and difference between the Lord and his energies or between the Lord and the living entities, like that.

**Key Quote:** "Material existence begins when the living entity is bewildered by the contact with material energy, by being placed in the material energy."
**Summary:** Material existence causes bewilderment and illusion, leading to a distorted perception of reality, unlike the unbewildered state of the Lord and the pure spirit soul in spiritual existence.

So here clearly the demigods are helping us understand the position of the Lord as Avismitam. He's always. He's never wonderstruck by anything because on the other hand we are subject to becoming bewildered. Material existence begins when the living entity is bewildered by the contact with material energy, by being placed in the material energy. So, due to our material conception, we are always in a bewildered state of existence in this material world. That's why if we practice spiritual life, we become free from this bewilderment gradually. We become sober. Otherwise, in a bewildered state of existence, we are unable to understand what is what in truth, in reality. Just like under the influence of illusion, being bewildered by this illusory energy, influence of illusory energy, we are considering matter to be spirit and spirit to be matter. Just the opposite. So that is the influence of illusion and that is the bewilderment caused by our coming in contact with this illusory energy. Otherwise in our original position as pure spirit soul, in spiritual existence, we are always able to be in an unbewildered state, in a sober state, like the Lord. But the Lord is always unbewildered, always, Avismitam. And our condition is, as long as we are in spiritual existence, we are also avismitam. But when we come in contact with this material world, or material nature, we are placed in material existence. Why? of our desire to enjoy independently. Krishna bhulia ji bhoga vanchakari. So this bhoga vancha, desire for independent enjoyment is the cause of our being put into this material existence and the immediate effect is vismitam. We become bewildered.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He is spiritually perfect and he is fully satisfied within himself."
**Summary:** The Lord is always fully satisfied, while living entities in material existence constantly seek satisfaction and happiness, which can only be found through devotional service.

And Lord is paripurna kama. He is always fully satisfied by his own spiritual perfection. He is spiritually perfect and he is fully satisfied within himself. So he doesn't seek satisfaction at any time, in any condition. And our condition at least in material existence is that we are always seeking two things. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna describes his pure devotees, tushyanti ca ramanthi ca. Fully satisfied and fully joyful, blissful, happy. Because material existence characteristic is we are not satisfied and we are not happy. So Lord is fully satisfied and fully joyful. And our position in spiritual existence in our original constitutional position in relationship with the Lord as His eternal servant, is that we are also satisfied and happy completely, like the Lord. Paripurna kama. He is paripurna kama. That is completely, perfectly, always satisfied and happy, but we can be purna kama, we can be fully satisfied and fully happy in our position. But if we are forgetful of the Lord or we are desiring independent enjoyment, we are placed in the material world, then we are always seeking that satisfaction and happiness which we lose when we come to material existence. Therefore Krishna says you take to devotional service and engaged in devotional service even in the material world, you become unbewildered. And you will be fully satisfied and happy in devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "In devotional service one becomes completely happy and satisfied."
**Summary:** Devotional service leads to complete happiness and satisfaction, as the Lord is fully satisfied with his own spiritual perfection, while conditioned souls are subject to external influences.

macchitta madgata prana bodhayanta parasparam katayantasya mam nityam tuśyanti ca ramanthi ca. Śrīla Prabhupāda says in one discourse explaining this verse, he says everyone is seeking some satisfaction, some happiness in all their endeavors. But they can never find the happiness they are seeking or the satisfaction they are seeking in material activities. They take to devotional service. And in devotional service one becomes completely happy and satisfied. So that is the Lord's position, Paripurna kāma. Sveṇai valābhena. He is, sveṇai valābhena. He is fully satisfied with his own spiritual perfection. Sveṇai valābhena. His own spiritual perfection. Samam praśāntam. He is always very steady and equipoised. Whereas as tiny spirit soul we are subject to influence. That's our position. We cannot be unaffected by the external atmosphere. See if you are in the spiritual realm, you are not affected by the external atmosphere. So when you are in the spiritual atmosphere, then that atmosphere's influence is conducive for our well-being, for our happiness, for our satisfaction, for our fearlessness, for our being sobered etc., and when we are placed in the material existence, in the material atmosphere, the three gunas actually act on us and first thing that happens is we become bewildered, become unwholesome, become bewildered, we are not equipoised, we are always affected in different ways by

**Summary:** Material existence is characterized by the influence of the three gunas, while devotional service elevates one to the spiritual platform, where pure devotees remain unaffected by material conditions.

the three gunas and it's always a combination of the gunas that's acting. So sometimes in sattva guna, sometimes in raja guna, sometimes in tamo guna, different kinds of influence and bewilderment, confusion. So material existence is always, there is no prashantam, there is no steadiness, always ups and downs are there in material existence. So when we take to devotionalist service, we are immediately uplifted above the gunas, we come to the spiritual platform. And on the spiritual platform we become steady in our spiritual position. So the lord is always on the spiritual platform, he never descends to the material platform even though he comes to the material world. He comes to the material world but he remains on the spiritual plane in spiritual existence eternally. Devotees like pure devotees even if they come to this material world since they are always Krishna conscious, they are always in contact with Krishna, they are also always on the spiritual platform. Therefore, such pure devotees, whatever they speak, whatever they do, all their actions, all their words, all their thoughts, everything is 100% spiritual. They are always perfect in their behavior, in their character, they are unaffected by any materialistic activity, any material condition, any situation.

**Key Quote:** "Supreme Personality of God is the only shelter of everyone."
**Summary:** The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only shelter for everyone, as described by Sridhar Swami, with Krishna being the ultimate source and shelter of all surrendered souls.

Then after describing these wonderful qualities of the Lord, the demigods are telling that Supreme Personality of God is the only shelter of everyone. Okay? He is the only shelter for everyone. So Prabhupada explains in one place, he is quoting Sridhar Swami, the original commentator of the Bhagavatam. Sridhar Swami, before he begins writing the commentary on the 10th canto of the Bhagavatam, he says about the 10th canto itself that, the 10th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam reveals the 10th object, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the shelter of all surrendered souls. There are 10 subjects in the Srimad Bhagavatam. The 10th subject is Krishna himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he is described as the shelter of all surrendered souls. He is known as Sri Krishna and he is the ultimate source of all the universes. Let me offer my obeisances unto him. So Prabhupada says, this is a quotation from the Bhavarth Deepika, Sridhar Swami's commentary on Srimad Bhagavatam. In the 10th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a description of Ashraya Tattva, Sri Krishna and Ashrita Tattva. There are two Tattvas, Ashraya Tattva and Ashrita Tattva. So Ashraya Tattva is the objective, and Ashrita Tattva is the subjective. Since the lotus feet of Sri Krishna are the shelter of all devotees, Sri Krishna is also called Paramdhama. Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna addressing Krishna says, Parambrahma Paramdhama. Paramdhama means Krishna's lotus feet is the shelter of everyone. Krishna is the shelter of everyone, supreme shelter. Everything is resting under the lotus feet of Krishna and that is described in the words that Prabhupada quotes here, how Krishna is the shelter of everyone from the Bhagavatam. Samāśrīta ye padapallavaplavaṁ mahāt-padaṁ puṇya-yeśoa marāya dtih. Lord Krishna is the shelter of everyone and the whole material existence, the bliss of all is the shelter of everyone.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is called Ashraya Tattva. Means He is the only one who can give protection, who can give shelter. Nobody else can give shelter to anybody else."
**Summary:** Everything rests under Krishna's lotus feet, making Him the only true shelter (Ashraya Tattva), while seeking protection from demigods is foolish.

is resting under the lotus feet of Krishna, whole material existence. So here it is said, under the lotus feet of Shree Krishna, the entire Mahat Tattva is existing. Mahat Tattva is existing under the lotus feet of Krishna. And that Mahat Tattva is the starting point for this creation. From Mahat Tattva the elements get differentiated and the elements are later on combined to form this whole material world. So since everything is under Krishna's protection, Krishna is called Ashraya Tattva. Means He is the only one who can give protection, who can give shelter. Nobody else can give shelter to anybody else. Nobody else can do that. Because we are all sheltered. We belong to a different category, Ashrita Tattva, we are sheltered and Krishna is the shelter. So if somebody thinks that they can take shelter of some devatas because they are also relatively more powerful than us or they have misconception that among the devatas, different devatas have different degrees of power or different kinds of powers so they approach different demigods for different benefits or different kinds of relief. So sometimes people worship devatas seeking their protection but the example given here is anyone desiring to be protected by others especially demigods is certainly a great fool. He is described as Balishaha is a fool, one who seeks a shelter or protection by taking protection, by taking shelter of someone else especially demigods because it's like trying to cross the sea by holding the tail of a dog.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "One should seek shelter only of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** Seeking shelter from demigods is like trying to cross the ocean by holding a dog's tail, only the Supreme Lord can save us from all dangers.

Now why this analogy is given is Prabhupada explains that dog can swim in the water, dogs don't have to learn swimming. They naturally swim when you put them in water. Even if they have never gone into water, you just throw a dog into the water, it can swim. But even if the dog can swim, it can never, if it's thrown into the middle of an ocean, it cannot swim across an ocean. That is not possible. Neither if a dog can swim, can somebody hold the tail of the dog and expect that because the dog can swim across a small, even a small, what do you say, a small body of water. But somebody thinks that, oh, it can swim, it can save me. No. By holding the tail of a dog to cross some body of water, speak of crossing the ocean. It's not possible. It's not possible for anybody to cross the ocean like that. So taking shelter or protection of the demigods is like that. So one should seek shelter only of the Supreme Lord. And only the Supreme Lord can actually save us from all dangers in life. Only the Supreme Lord can actually save us from all dangers in life. We shouldn't take shelter from this material existence. So this is one of Brahma's prayer that petite samashrita ye pada pallava plavam he compares the Lord's lotus feet. Udadi 제일 naa Habit Becky He compares the Lord's lotus feet to an indestructible boat.

**Key Quote:** "If we are drowning in the middle of an ocean, then by ourselves we cannot cross the ocean, neither by help of anybody else other than the Supreme Lord can we cross the ocean."
**Summary:** Taking shelter of the Lord's lotus feet is like boarding an indestructible boat that shrinks the ocean of material existence, allowing devotees to easily cross over to the spiritual world.

If we are drowning in the middle of an ocean, then by ourselves we cannot cross the ocean, neither by help of anybody else other than the Supreme Lord can we cross the ocean. So we take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, which are like an indestructible boat. And what happens if you take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, which is like an indestructible boat? That Bhavambuddhir Vatsapadam, this ocean of material existence shrinks and becomes like the quantity of water contained in the footprint of a calf. Vatsa means calf. The whole material existence which is like an unlimited ocean, it shrinks to become the water contained in the footprint of a calf. And consequently, devotees, when they take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet to the Lord, they are able to cross over this ocean of material existence. They don't have to wait for the boat to take them across the ocean, they simply step across, that small quantity of water. And they step across the ocean of material existence, which has become shrunk into the water contained in the footprint of a calf. And they go to the other side. On one side, this material world or material existence is separated from the surface of the ocean. This material world or material existence is separated from the surface of the ocean. It is separated from the spiritual world by a body of water, by a river called Viraja. So that Viraja river, one side is this material world, other side is the spiritual world. So when the devotees cross over across this ocean of material existence, they go to the other side of the Viraja river. They enter the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "There is danger in every step."
**Summary:** The material world is characterized by constant danger and suffering caused by the three modes of nature, symbolized by Durga Devi's trident.

So, crossing over, parampadam, they attain the spiritual kingdom of the Supreme Lord, Parampadam. And Brahma is telling, the devotees are not meant to live in the material world, which is characterized by padampadam yad vipadam. There is danger in every step. Padampadam yad vipadam. Our material existence under the influence of illusion, we think, yes, material world there are dangers, we know that. And we think sometimes there are dangers. At other times, there are moments or there are times when we are safe. There are times when we are not able to move. There are times when we go to the other side. There are times when there is danger and we make plans to counteract those dangers by our own methods in ignorance under the influence of illusion. But actually the scriptures and the acharyas they warn us material world is not such a place that there are dangers sometimes. This material world is conducted by the three modes and these three modes the sattva guna, rajya guna, tamo guna are constantly harassing the living entities who are in this material world. And symbolically Durga Devi she has got ten hands and she is holding in one of the hands the trishul, trident. That trident represents these three gunas by which we are bound up to this material world. And these three gunas are like the three prongs of the trident with which sometimes there is a picture shown of Durga Devi killing one demon with her trident. Right? So, the demon is being pierced by the three prongs of the trident. Actually that's not just the demon along who is in that condition, but every living entity, every conditioned soul is being affected with afflicted with three-fold miseries, Tapatraya. The three prongs of the trident held by Durga Devi represents the three kinds of kleshas which are constantly bothering us, Adibhautika, Adhyatmika, Adidaivika.

**Key Quote:** "Under the influence of illusion sometimes the living entity thinks some misery to be actually enjoyment."
**Summary:** Living entities in the material world are constantly suffering from miseries, but under the influence of illusion, they sometimes mistake misery for enjoyment.

Constantly there are miseries and the foolishness of the living entity is under the influence of illusion sometimes the living entity thinks some misery to be actually enjoyment. There is always misery. There is always miseries and we are always suffering from these miseries but under illusion one may think some misery to be actually enjoyment. The shastras give one example. Just like even if a small thorn pricks your foot when you are walking barefoot, let us say, a thorn pricks your foot, immediately you feel some pain and then you want to walk barefoot. You want to remove that thorn. Right? It will get rid of the pain. Okay. Now this is something which is very common reaction. Being, you know, pierced by some needle or thorn or something like that. But what about people, in order to decorate themselves, let us say with an earring, they will voluntarily go and get their ear pierced. Voluntarily go and get their ears pierced. And when that piercing is happening, oh, very nice. Actually it is paining. Even though you may not have experience, everybody may not have experience of getting pierced by a thorn, but at least sometime when you have taken an injection, when they prick that syringe into your arm, at that time, momentarily you feel the pain. Correct? So like that, even though this is painful, but this is considered painful, or the pricking of a thorn is considered painful, this is considered very nice, very pleasing. So this is foolishness actually.

**Key Quote:** "Death itself is hanging like a sword on our neck."
**Summary:** The fear of death is always present, and relief from misery is often misinterpreted as happiness, while the factual position in material existence is constant unhappiness and distress.

This is foolishness. This is the influence of illusion. Even though we are constantly suffering from miseries, and even dangers, we think sometimes there is some danger to your life. But actually, the scriptures describe, death itself is hanging like a sword on our neck. Any moment death can come, and we have to die. Hmm? And that fear of death is always there. But sometimes when there is some relief from some misery, that is wrongly interpreted as happiness. Relief from misery is interpreted as happiness. Because when there is some miserable condition, we try to counteract that misery, and that counteracting effort may give us some relief. And that relief is thought of as something very nice, very enjoyable. Just like you have stomach pain, and then you seek relief from it. And when there is, let's say some indigestion, and that indigestion is cured by some simple digestive pill. So then, you get some relief, you feel very nice. Oh, I got relief from that pain, just bothering me. But how long can you rejoice that freedom from pain, that relief? For a little time. Afterwards, again you are back to the business of seeking happiness. Because your actual position in material existence is to be always in a miserable condition, to be always unhappy, to be always distressed. That is our factual position in the material world. But under the influence of illusion and due to the influence of the gunas, effect of the gunas, we think sometimes we are happy, sometimes we are unhappy, and sometimes there is a neutral state where we are not exactly unhappy, but we are seeking happiness. So therefore, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains that three conditions of material existence, there is happiness, there is distress, and there is mixed happiness and distress. You see, these are the three factual conditions. And that happiness is illusory happiness. It is not real happiness. Illusory happiness. And that mixed happiness and distress is, even that illusory happiness is not exclusively that happiness, material happiness. There is no exclusive material happiness. It is always mixed happiness and distress.

**Key Quote:** "It is only the spiritual world which is suitable for us."
**Summary:** The material world is not the right atmosphere for the spirit soul, and only devotional service can transfer us to our original position of eternal happiness in the spiritual world.

So, in that way, this material world is described here as every step there is danger. We are always in a miserable condition. Because we make an adjustment. Being spirit soul, we are meant to be in the spiritual atmosphere where naturally we are always happy. We are always leading an eternal life full of bliss and knowledge. But material existence, actually it is not the right atmosphere for the spirit soul, this material atmosphere. So we are always uncomfortable, just like a fish out of water. And always we are seeking to get rid of this discomfort by changing our position. But this constant changing of position, as long as we are in material world, no other place in the material world is actually a suitable place for us. It is only the spiritual world which is suitable for us. So that we learn from the authoritative or confidential scriptures. We belong to the spiritual world and that is the only place where we can be properly situated eternally in happiness, complete satisfaction. So therefore, to transfer ourselves to our original position, get out of this material existence, is only possible by devotional service. And by devotional service it becomes easy and it is very effective, very powerful. And that is the only way to actually get eternal happiness.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is nothing external and internal."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that true knowledge is not merely perceiving forms through senses or intellect, as these are external coverings, and contrasts this with Krishna, who is not separate from His form.

and understanding or are actually coming to knowledge. So, through these senses and our mind also, if you are able to perceive, we can see forms through these eyes, we can hear sounds through these ears, we can smell different fragrances through the nose, we can perceive subtle things through the mind or even the intelligence we can perceive, but that is not knowledge. That is not knowledge. Merely perceiving a form doesn't mean you know what that is. It's like I am seeing your form, and even if I understand what this form is, but I am thinking I am seeing you, but actually I am not seeing you. I am seeing your external covering. You are within that form called the body. Even if I perceive your mind, still I am not perceiving you. I am perceiving your mind, different from you, different from me. Even if I perceive your intelligence, I am able to, you know, figure out something about your intelligence, oh, you are an intelligent person, you are learned in such and such a subject or whatever, you are a mature adult, but still that is not you. Those are all the characteristics of your subtle body called intelligence, mind, intelligence, ego, body. So the body is different, the body is different, the person is different, but not in the case of Krishna. Krishna has appeared in the specific form, 400 form, Narayana form, but that is not the external form of Krishna. No, Krishna is nothing external and internal. Shukadeva Gosvami describing Mother Yashoda is trying to catch Krishna and Krishna is running away after stealing butter, not stealing, after breaking a butter pot and taking the butter. So then Mother Yashoda has become very angry against Krishna, why is he spoiling the...

much love for a child, how can I beat him? She's taken a stick actually to punish him by beating him, but then seeing his fear on his face, she said, I cannot punish this child, small child, but some mischief it is doing. No, no, she threw away the stick then, but still she was thinking where to stop his, I have to stop his naughty activities. So I have to bind him and now I have to punish him some way, so let me just tie him. Let me just tie him, but at least he will stop for the time being, he'll stop his naughty activities. So she decided to tie him to that grinding mortar and then she brought rope and then she's trying to tie him with some rope and the rope is not sufficient. Why? Why is that rope not sufficient? Shukadeva Goswami explains that Krishna, Supreme Lord, has no inside, has no outside, is no inside, no outside. After all, when she's trying to tie him, she is trying to tie him external measurement of his body, right? With the grinding mortar. Grinding mortar also got an external form, certain shape, certain size. Krishna is a small boy, so together she has to bind. So first time she tried binding, the length of the rope was not enough. He bought some more rope. Now she's bringing more and more rope and it is not enough to tie him. Why?

**Summary:** The speaker explains that neither the soul nor Krishna can be measured due to their lack of physical form, and understanding Krishna requires transcendental knowledge.

because Krishna has no form which is measurable. Even the soul is immeasurable. The soul doesn't have a physical form. What is the Sanskrit word in the second chapter? Uh, immeasurable. Krishna is also and there is one Temple of Krishna when you go from here to Bangalore on the way what is that? Udupi Swami Temple. So Lord is called immeasurable.

There is nothing there to measure. What will you measure? Where is the form to measure something? So therefore that which is within this material world made of matter that you can measure or you may try to measure it okay you can try to grasp it but Krishna's form is beyond this material world. So therefore to understand Krishna to know Krishna to see Krishna to perceive Krishna is possible only by transcendental knowledge. What is this transcendental knowledge? This is explained by Krishna himself in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the four kinds of pious people who surrender to Krishna, emphasizing that the ज्ञानी (one situated in knowledge) is the best because they are constantly devoted to worshipping Krishna.

says four kinds of pious people they surrender to me. Now this word Prabhupada translates, note the translation of Prabhupada, it is called parampara understanding of Bhagavad Gita, what does he translate it as surrender to me? Is it not? What is the word for meaning chaturvida bhajanthema bhajanthi the translation it is surrender the translation it is surrender but in the word for meaning 7.16 okay Prabhupada's in the word for meaning is given rendered service bhaja means devotional service okay in the translation also it's notive satsang surroundosen i am a god and have monde whose and four kinds of people surrender. Of course the sense in which this bhajante is in the sense of the word prapadyate. It's in the sense of surrender. Okay, it comes in the 19th verse, prapadyate. बहुनाम जन्मनामंते ज्ञानमान्माम् प्रपद्यते Anyway, the point I want to make is that in the 19th verse, in this 16th verse, 7th chapter, Krishna says four kinds of people begin to render devotional service to Him. बजन्ते आर्त जिग्ञासु अर्थार्थी ज्ञानी Of these four categories, Krishna says ज्ञानी is the best. Why? Because he says तेशाम ज्ञानी नित्य युक्ता ज्ञानी means one who is situated in knowledge. Knowledge of what? Knowledge of the Supreme Lord. बितितोसि भवान साक्षात पुरुषह प्रकृते परहा This knowledge. Here ज्ञानी refers to one who knows कृष्णा as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And the result of knowing कृष्णा as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is तेशाम ज्ञानी नित्य युक्ता एक भक्तिर्। विशिश्यते एक भक्तिर् नित्य युक्ता He is completely devoted to worshipping कृष्णा.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts deity worship with the Mayavadi philosophy, explaining that true bhakti involves worshipping the transcendental form of God from the beginning, which can only be perceived through transcendental knowledge.

concoction some imaginary form which is not God. Therefore, when the atheists say that these worshippers of God, especially in the form of deity, are some particular form which they think is material, and even the Mayavadis or the impersonal, they think that this form is material form and it's imaginary form because God is formless, so you cannot worship formless. So therefore, but shastra says one should worship God. So the Mayavadis think, yeah, we have to worship the impersonal Brahman, we have to worship the impersonal Brahman. That's an understanding of the absolute truth. So how do you worship impersonal Brahman? The method of worshiping the impersonal Brahman of the impersonalists is you imagine some form in the beginning, you imagine some form. Later on, when you realize God, then you forget all this imaginary form because that's not God anyway, so you forget that, you stop that. But our process of devotional service, bhakti, is not like that. Real bhakti is we worship that transcendent form of God from the beginning and even in the end, always we only worship God, real God, and that form is prakriti, that form is the form of the transcendental personality who is transcendental to this material creation and that form can be perceived only by...

**Summary:** The speaker explains that while God cannot be perceived simply through material senses, the science of Krishna Consciousness helps us understand that God appears in forms we can perceive, but these forms are transcendental, not material.

transcendental knowledge, only by transcendental knowledge. So in the beginning, even if we are not able to perceive God because we are not yet conversant with transcendental knowledge, then we are told you just chant Hare Krishna. हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे हरे राम हरे राम राम राम हरे हरे that is the way to perceive God in the beginning. These are the ways, but you also understand that actually God cannot be perceived simply by with these eyes seeing one deity form, you cannot perceive God like that because he is not having any material form. His form is not material, yet the deity is made up of what? Either wood or stone or metal. That is very much material, but the science of Krishna Consciousness helps us understand that God has appeared in a form which we can see or perceive sound form or material metal form or a form of a description in the scriptures. Here description is there. Krishna appeared in this 400 form, the description is there which we can understand, we can, we can get some idea what he looks like or what form he appeared, not in a form, but this is not a material form. This is not a ordinary form, neither the form the deity nor the sound of Hare Krishna nor the form which appeared in front of Vasudeva is a material form. It's a transcendental form. So that transcendental form is perceived only by...

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that transcendental knowledge, necessary to perceive Krishna, is realized through devotional service, highlighting Vasudeva's pure devotion and the importance of Sadhana Bhakti in awakening this knowledge.

transcendental knowledge. What is a transcendental knowledge? The knowledge that the Supreme Lord is the Supreme person is completely spiritual personality who is realized only by bhakti. Bhakti abhijanati abhijanati so many verses in the Bhagavad Gita they explain it is explained in the Bhagavat Gita Krishna can be seen or understood or known or worshiped only by bhakti equivocal cells. So this Transcendental knowledge also is realize or understood or obtained by devotional service and Vasudeva is actually a pure devotee. Vasudeva is a pure devotee and therefore Krishna chose to appear as his son for his Leela in this material world. He chose to appear as his son. So he is participating in Krishna Leela and part of that Leela is that Vasudeva is praying to the Lord I want to have a son like you. This is Leela. He is already a devotee. There is no need for him to ask Krishna you appear as my son or I want to have a son like you. There is no need. There is no need for a devotee to even ask because already he is he is always Nityayukta Ekabhaktyar Nityayukta Upasate he is always worshipping the Lord constantly. So therefore it is part of the Leela the birth pastime of Krishna Janma Karma Chame Divyam and as far as we are concerned we can see or we can understand or we can realize or we can perceive Krishna only through Transcendental Knowledge that is the understanding your form can be perceived by Transcendental Knowledge therefore this Transcendental Knowledge is awakened in our heart it is already there but it is awakened by the process of Sadhana Bhakti.

**Key Quote:** "This technology is a blessing Vaishnavas use this for spreading Krishna consciousness moment it is arrangement of the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the role of technology, particularly the internet, as a divine arrangement for spreading Krishna consciousness, contrasting it with the limitations of physical communication in the past.

And these are all what is happening, we can see that not without, not outside the control of the Lord, but this technology is a blessing. Vaishnavas use this for spreading Krishna consciousness. The moment it is arrangement of the Lord, this is what we feel so much confidence that see this, so much this technology is so much connected to spreading Krishna consciousness, otherwise what is the means of communication village to village, village to village and all? If somebody that time when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said every town and village my name will be sung, even physically one does calculation, hey how is it possible to communicate this? Then airplanes came, Prabhupada went to America and he communicated all over the world, he travelled, he communicated. Now internet has come, we are able to sit and we are able to hear about Soulful Japa, we are here about Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam, everything is going online now.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna has not sent us here. We have come here."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that we come to the material world due to our desire to enjoy independently of Krishna and to lord over others.

Here in classes we used to learn that if we follow regulative principles, we will go back to Krishna and never come back. But we all come from Krishna only. Why did Krishna send us here? Krishna has not sent us here. We have come here. Why have we come here? Two reasons. One is our desire to enjoy independent of Krishna. The second desire we have is to lord over everyone and everything.

**Key Quote:** "Here everyone is trying to be the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the spiritual world, where Krishna is the undisputed Lord, with the material world, where everyone seeks to be a lord in their own domain, influenced by their karma.

In the spiritual world our pleasure, our enjoyment, our happiness is always in association with Krishna. And in the spiritual world everyone is subordinate to Krishna. Krishna is the only Lord. Ekala, Ishvara, Krishna are Sabha, Vrithya. That's a reality. That's a fact in the spiritual world. But somebody thinks why should Krishna be the Lord? Why I can't be the Lord? Or why I can't take Krishna's position? Then for such people the material world is created by Krishna. Here everyone is trying to be the Lord. And according to our karma, we have different lordship positions. From Brahma up to the most insignificant ant, everyone is Lord in their own field. In Hindi there is a saying, Har kutta apna gali mein share. Of course that's told in a lighter way. I don't mean that, but what I'm saying is everyone wants to be the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Even Brahma doesn't have the power to lord over everyone like Krishna lords over."
**Summary:** The speaker uses Brahma as an example of someone with significant power in the material world, but who is still subject to the laws of material nature and not truly independent.

So according to their karma, they can lord over some people. Brahma has got the power, authority over the entire universe. But even this universe is one insignificant universe among millions of universes. So even Brahma doesn't have the power to lord over everyone like Krishna lords over. Krishna is the Lord. But in his own sphere Brahma thinks I am the Lord. I am the Lord of everyone. His purview is this entire universe which consists of millions of planets. Each planet has millions of living beings. Yes, Brahma is in a very, very, very, very big position. But still Brahma also, even though he is the Lord, he is also subject to the laws of material nature. He is not a free person. If he makes a mistake, he is accountable for the mistake. He is punished. He is punishable.

**Key Quote:** "Brahma has got a fantastic long life span. The longest life span anybody can ever have."
**Summary:** The speaker details the immense lifespan of Brahma, emphasizing that even he is subject to time and death, and uses the analogy of a 50-year-old person to illustrate Brahma's perspective.

And even Brahma has to die one day. Brahma has got a fantastic long life span. The longest life span anybody can ever have. The duration of the whole universe, universal time. Brahma's life span is this kind in Bhagavad Gita: Sahasra yuga pariyantam har yad brahmano idhu. One thousand yuga cycles. Mahayuga. Satya, Treta, Dwapara, Kali. Four yugas rotating cyclically. One such cycle of yugas passing is called Mahayuga. And thousand Mahayugas. One thousand Mahayugas is twelve hours of Brahma's time scale. So Brahma lives hundred years like that. We calculate Brahma's life span is 311 trillion years according to our calculation. 311 trillion years. But even that long life span, Brahma thinks I have only hundred years to live. And Brahma's already 50 years is over. 50 years of Brahma is over. Half his life span is over. It is like how would a 50 year old person feel in this material world? Half my life span is over approximately. Say we live about hundred years. So half our life span is over, no? When I am 50 years old. Correct? That's why Brahma thinks.

**Key Quote:** "Actually we are spirit soul. We are no death."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that we are eternal spirit souls, but our identification with the body leads to illusion and the experience of material existence, influenced by the three gunas.

Each person thinks about his or her life according to the body they are having. Actually we are spirit soul. We are no death. There is nothing like life span for the spirit soul. They are eternal beings. But why do we think in terms of body? That's called material existence. That's called illusion. So we come here not because Krishna sends us here. We come here because we wanted to lord over everyone and everything. So we are given this material world. And we wanted to independently enjoy. So that independent enjoyment is only in the material world. And also under illusion. There is no independence. We are strictly under the stringent laws of the material nature. We are under the three gunas. These three gunas are influencing us. Every action. Sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna. Combination of that is influencing each one of us.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that we are under the control of the three gunas, despite thinking we are independent, and that all material bodies, including Brahma's, are subject to death.

So we are under the stringent control of these three gunas. But we think we are independent. Because the gunas influence is not perceived by us. Nobody perceives the influence of the gunas. Nobody perceives. Except devotees, pure devotees who know what these gunas are. And they can recognize the gunas. Nobody knows what these gunas are. So we are completely under control. But we think we are free. We are independent. And we think we are going to live eternally in this body. But the fact is we are eternal, but not in this body. Any body that anybody inhabits, including Brahma, that body has got a limited duration of life span. So they have to die. They have to die.

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of whether considering Shiva as subordinate to Vishnu or Krishna is offensive, stating that it is not.

Does portraying Lord Krishna the Supreme alter the essence of Hinduism? Because during my childhood, grandparents used to say, Lord Shiva is the Deva of all Devas, therefore his name is Mahadeva. So now if we consider Shiva as a demigod, Devata, subordinate to Vishnu or Krishna, will it become an offense? No.

**Key Quote:** "But greater than Brahma is Shiva because Shiva is not a Jeeva."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the hierarchy among Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, highlighting their roles as permanent governors and emphasizing Shiva's superiority over Brahma because Shiva is not a Jeeva (living entity).

When Shiva is described as Mahadeva or the Deva of all Devas, you should understand that there is a hierarchy among Devas. Among all the Devas, four personalities have that special position. First one is Brahma. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are called Chiraloka Pala. They are the permanent governors of this universe. That means their position does not change throughout the duration of the whole universe. All other personalities who are holding positions of power, all other Devatas, their duration is of a limited time. Maximum is one Manvantara, 71 Mahayugas, that's it. After that they have to quit their position. Whereas Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, throughout the duration of the whole universe, they don't change their position. Among the three, Brahma is actually a Jeeva, a living entity. But Brahma is immune to all the changes that take place in the universe during the life span of Brahma himself. So he is unaffected by anything that happens. But greater than Brahma is Shiva because Shiva is not a Jeeva. Shiva is not a living entity. Brahma has to die. Shiva has no death. Shiva doesn't have a material body. That's why he doesn't have to die. Death means what? Quitting the material body is called death. Soul has no death. None of us have death. So even Brahma doesn't have death as soul. But when you say Brahma also has to die means he has to leave his body as Brahma. That Brahma's body. He has to leave that. He has to quit that. But Shiva, he doesn't have a material body. He never accepts a material body.

#### Shiva's transcendental birth, Shiva not a Jeeva, Comparison to Krishna

**Key Quote:** "So Shiva's birth is like Krishna's birth."
**Summary:** The speaker compares Shiva's birth to Krishna's, describing both as transcendental, and reiterates that Shiva is not a Jeeva, unlike Brahma and other Devatas.

So Shiva's birth is like Krishna's birth. Krishna is born as a son of Vasudeva and Devaki. But Krishna's birth is transcendental. Shiva's birth also is transcendental in this material world. He comes to this material world for the purpose of doing his, playing his part in this whole material arrangement. He is the lord of destruction. He is the husband of Durga Devi. He is the master of the Tamoguna. Director of Tamoguna. Like that. He has got many many positions. Many many powers. Many many responsibilities. But he is one person who doesn't have a material body. Okay. And Shiva in that position as Shiva he is always superior to Brahma and all the other people below Brahma. Among the Devatas, Brahma is the topmost. But Shiva is above Brahma. Because Shiva is not at all a Jeeva. All the other Devatas are Jeevas. But Brahma is also a Jeeva. But Shiva is not a Jeeva.

**Key Quote:** "Vishnu never comes in contact with material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vishnu is superior to Shiva because Vishnu never comes into contact with material energy, and emphasizes that only Vishnu possesses unlimited power among the Devatas.

Now Vishnu is above Shiva. Because Shiva, even though he doesn't have a material body, he comes in contact with material energy. Vishnu, like Shiva, he does not accept a material body. So he has also no death. He doesn't want to quit any body. But Vishnu never comes in contact with material life. He never comes in contact with material energy. He never touches material energy. So Vishnu is superior even to Shiva. There is one difference between Vishnu and Shiva. Another difference is Shiva's power is limited. Though it is much much greater than Brahma's power. Brahma's power is more than all other Devata's power. Every Devata has got gradation of power. So everybody in this material world except for Vishnu, everyone's power is limited. Though the different extent of powers they have, limited. But Vishnu has unlimited power. Only Vishnu has unlimited power. Among the Devata's, only Vishnu has unlimited power.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Durga Devi as Vishnu Maya, the energy through which the material world is created, maintained, and destroyed, and mentions that the Devi Purana describes her glories.

What about Durga Devi? Durga Devi is not a Jeeva. She is not a living entity. She is not even in the category of Devata's. She is not in the category of Devata's. She is the personal energy of Krishna or Vishnu. She is called Vishnu Maya. Vishnu Maya. She is the energy through which this material world is created, maintained and destroyed. So in the Devi Purana it is described Durga Devi's glories are described. She is the maintainer. She is the creator. She is the destroyer of the entire material universe. She is greater than even Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Brahma only creates. Vishnu only maintains. Shiva only destroys. She is the creator, maintainer and destroyer of entire universe. She is greater than Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.

**Key Quote:** "Durga is not independent in creating, maintaining and destroying. She is always subordinate to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Durga Devi acts as an agency executing Krishna's will through Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, who direct creation, maintenance, and destruction, respectively.

But what people don't understand is She is definitely the creator, maintainer and destroyer of this material world. But she is the agency through which according to Krishna's will, creation, maintenance and destruction takes place. She is the agency. And that agency works for creating, maintaining and destroying according to the will of Krishna. Krishna's will is executed by three personalities called Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Brahma creates according to the will of Krishna through the agency of Durga. Vishnu maintains according to the will of Krishna. Krishna means he himself. According to his own will. Vishnu maintains according to his own will through the agency of Durga. And Shiva destroys according to the will of Krishna through the agency of Durga. So Durga is not independent in creating, maintaining and destroying. She is always subordinate to Krishna. She simply carries out Krishna's will. But the exact direction for doing it comes through Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. So Brahma directs the creation. Vishnu directs the maintenance. Shiva directs the destruction. They are directors. They are directors of Durga

#### Three Gunas, Material Nature, Subtle Elements

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Energy is manifest as the three gunas."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the three gunas (Satva, Rajas, Tamas) as the energy of material nature, contrasting them with the eight material elements (five gross and three subtle) described in the Bhagavad Gita.

is present in the form of these three gunas. In the Bhagavad Gita, in the 14th chapter, Krishna describes. No. The verse would describe the three gunas. Satvam rajasthama iti guna praktisambhavaha. Material nature consists of three gunas. In the 7th chapter, Krishna describes material nature consists of eight elements. Eight elements. Ashta dhatu. Bhumirapo nalo vayu kham mano buddhi revaca ahankara. Eight elements. These eight elements are inert matter. But where is material energy? Where is energy? Energy is manifest as the three gunas. Satvam rajasthama iti guna praktisambhavaha. This is the confidential knowledge revealed by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. Generally people who are conversant with little something about the Vedic scriptures, they know all material things are made of pancha bhuta. Five elements. Most people know about this. Our body also. Pancha bhuta. Earth, water, fire, air, sky. Correct? But many people don't know there are three other elements which are called subtle elements. Sukshma. They are subtle elements. Mind, intelligence, ego. These are three subtle elements. They are making up our subtle body. We got a gross body made up of all these organs and senses and all the parts of the body, everything. But there is inside one subtle body. Mind, intelligence and ego. Subtle body. But those are also three elements of matter only. They are also matter. There is no life in mind, intelligence, ego. Real life is coming from the soul. What about then these three gunas? These three gunas is what prakriti is made of. Which is the energy called material energy. Energy means some force is there. That force is actually making all the changes to happen in this material creation.

**Key Quote:** "Those gunas are directed by Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva according to the will of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how the three gunas drive changes in the material creation, directed by Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva according to Krishna's will, and how the body, influenced by the gunas, binds living entities to the material world.

Just like you sow a seed. It grows up into a big tree. How those changes are taking place? Seasons are changing. Planets are rotating in the orbit. Okay. Whatever changes happening in our body, in the outside world, any changes that are happening, that's the force of the gunas. Those gunas are directed by Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva according to the will of Krishna. So Krishna is the topmost personality. Simply as to will, let there be creation. Brahma will do the necessary execution of that will through Durga Devi. Through the Rajoguna. Rajoguna of Durga Devi. Satyoguna is used by Vishnu for maintenance. Through Satyoguna, maintenance happens. And Tamoguna is used for destruction by Shiva. Through Tamoguna, agency of Tamoguna, Shiva destroys. He is the director of Tamoguna. Director of destruction. Vishnu is the director of Satyoguna. He is the director of maintenance. Like that. So, Durga's position is she is nothing to do with actually anything in this material world except she is simply facilitating creation, maintenance, destruction. She keeps all the living entities bound up in the material world. Through the Gunas. We are bound up by the Gunas. That is through the Gunas this body is actually working. And this body is tying us down to this material world.

**Key Quote:** "Durga Devi is not independent in controlling anybody. She controls exactly according to the laws. Those laws are laws of God."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a jail superintendent (Durga Devi) enforcing the laws of a higher authority (Krishna) to illustrate how Durga Devi controls the material world according to Krishna's laws, emphasizing that Krishna is the ultimate controller.

Because the body we cannot do whatever we want to do. The body is limiting us. Just like a bird has got a body to fly, it can fly. We don't have a body to fly, we cannot fly. In this body I can't fly. I require the help of an aeroplane to fly. But a bird can just fly. Right? So, everybody is bound up by the body. That body is an effect of the interaction of the three Gunas. Anyway, this is a very big subject. So, basically we are all actually under the control of Maya or Durga through this body. Everybody has got a body. Including Brahma. Brahma has got a body also. So, Brahma is also under the control of Durga Devi. How? Through his body. Anybody who has got a material body is under control. But Durga Devi is not independent in controlling anybody. She controls exactly according to the laws. Those laws are laws of God. Laws of Krishna. Called laws of Karma. Krishna is the controller. The real controller is Krishna. Not Durga. Durga on behalf of Krishna is like the jail superintendent. Is keeping all the prisoners inside the prison. Controlling the prison. But under higher authority. They say authority, state authority. Who should be imprisoned? Who should be released? When they should be released? What should be the conditions in the prison? Rigorous imprisonment. Somebody's simple imprisonment. All that is regulated by the higher authority. But the jail superintendent even though the most powerful person in the jail. But still is carrying out simply the orders of the higher authority. Enforcing the higher authority's orders. That is Durga Devi's position. She is the jail superintendent of this jail called the material world.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that everyone has a relationship with Krishna, but to understand it, one must cleanse their heart through chanting Hare Krishna, leading to a loving relationship that can manifest in various forms like friendship, servitude, or familial affection.

Yeah, scriptures explain that all of us have a relationship with Krishna. Sit down. All of us have a relationship with Krishna, but before we understand our relationship with Krishna, we have to cleanse our heart of so many dirty things that are there which are making us forget Krishna. We have to cleanse our heart. So, for cleansing, the best process is chanting Hare Krishna. You chant Hare Krishna, you cleanse your heart. Then, after cleansing the heart, you will understand who is Krishna, who you are, and then the relationship also, you will understand. So that relationship is based on love. So, similarly, friendship with Krishna, you can have friendly relation with Krishna, you can serve Krishna as a servant. You can serve Krishna as one's own son, like mother Yashoda, Devaki, Vasudeva. They are all serving Krishna as their son, or Krishna can be served as one's beloved.

#### Lord Jagannath, Indra Dhyumna, Neelamadhava, Darubrahman

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "On top of Neela hill, you should construct a temple. There I will manifest as Darubrahman. The absolute truth manifested in a wooden form."
**Summary:** The story begins with King Indra Dhyumna's desire to see Lord Vishnu, the discovery of Neelamadhava, and the eventual instruction to build a temple where the Lord would manifest as Darubrahman.

Today is the day of the Rathayatra of Lord Jagannath, Baldev, and Subhadra. The story of Lord Jagannath is given in the Skanda Purana. I will try to narrate that story very briefly. There was a king by the name Indra Dhyumna, who was a great devotee of Vishnu. Indra Dhyumna became very eager to meet Lord Vishnu face to face. Once a Brahmana came to the palace of King Indra Dhyumna and told him about an incarnation of Lord Vishnu named Neelamadhava. The king then sent different brahmanas out to search for the deity of Lord Neelamadhava. They all returned unsuccessful except for one priest by name Vidyapati. Vidyapati travelled for a long time, after which he came to an area inhabited by non-Aryans called Shabaras. He stayed at the house of a local chief whose name was Vishwavasu. When he arrived, Vishwavasu was not there, but Vishwavasu's daughter Lalitha was at home. Vidyapati stayed there for some time, and eventually married Lalitha, the daughter of the Shabara chief, Vishwavasu. Vidyapati noticed some peculiar behavior of his host. Vishwavasu would go out every day around noon and would return to the house scented with fragrance of sandalwood, camphor, and musk. Vidyapati asked his wife about this and she informed him that her father went to worship him. Lalitha had been told by her father not to tell anyone about Neelamadhava, but that was in advance of her order. She was to be told by her father. Lalitha else had to announced any decision. By this, Linda had been pinched from mud Meela made clear her duty to his husband. विद्यापती रिपीटेडली रिक्वेस्टेड तो सी नीलमाधवा। फाइनली विश्वावसु ललितास फादर बाउन्ड विद्यापतीस आईस आन्ड टुक हिम तो सी नीलमाधवा। विद्यापती सीक्रत्ली कैरिट सम्मस्टर्ड सीट्स इन इस क्लॉथ आणि ड्रॉप्ट देम अन्द पाथ आज ही वस वाकिंग। वाल ही रीच्ट नीलमाधवा द ब्लाइंटफोल्ड वस रिमोव्ड आणि विद्यापती सो नीलमाधवा। Vishwavasu went out to collect some forest flowers to worship Neelamadhava, and Vidyapati stayed near the Deity. During this time, a crow fell off the branch of a tree into a nearby lake and drowned. It immediately took a four-armed Vaikuntha form and started back to the spiritual world. Vidyapati then climbed up onto the tree and was about to jump into the lake. A voice from the sky said, "Since you have seen Neelamadhava, you should inform King Indra." Vishwavasu returned and started his daily worship of Neelamadhava. Suddenly the Lord spoke to him and said, "I have accepted many days the simple forest flowers and roots offered to me by you. Now I desire the royal worship offered to me in devotion by King Indra Dhyumna." Vishwavasu felt cheated by his son-in-law. Therefore, he bound him up and kept him in his house. After repeatedly being requested by his daughter, he let him go. The Brahmana, with these words, said, "The Brahmana, Vidyapati, then went to King Indra Dhyumna and told him about his discovery. By following the mustard seeds which had grown into small plants, they were able to follow the path to Neelamadhava. When they reached the spot, they could not find him. King Indra Dhyumna had the village besieged and arrested Vishwavasu. Suddenly a voice from the sky told, "Release the Shabara. On top of Neela hill, you should construct a temple. There I will manifest as Darubrahman, the absolute truth manifested in a wooden form."

#### Temple construction, King Indra Dhyumna, Lord Brahma, Sri Kshetra

**Key Quote:** "Lord Brahma told him that Sri Kshetra is manifested by the Supreme Lord's internal potency and that the Supreme Lord manifests Himself."
**Summary:** King Indra Dhyumna builds the temple, travels to Brahmaloka to invite Lord Brahma to consecrate it, and faces a dispute over the temple's construction before Brahma establishes the importance of Sri Kshetra.

You will not see me as Neelamadhava. King Indra Dhyumna constructed a temple. He wanted Lord Brahma to consecrate the temple, so he travelled to Brahmaloka and waited there for him. During this time, the temple became covered by sand. While Indra Dhyumna was gone, first Suradeva and then Galamadhava became king of the area. King Galamadhava uncovered the temple from the sand. Shortly afterwards, King Indra Dhyumna returned from Brahma's abode. Indra Dhyumna claimed that he had built the temple, and Galamadhava also claimed the same thing. There was an old crow in the nearby banyan tree who was constantly singing the glories of Lord Rama. The crow had seen the construction of the temple and said that Indra Dhyumna had built the temple and that Gala Madhava had just uncovered it. Because he had not told the truth, Gala Madhava was ordered by Brahma to live outside the temple compound on the western side of Indra Dhyumna Sarovara lake. Indra Dhyumna then asked Lord Brahma to consecrate the temple and the surrounding area which was called Sri Kshetra. He gave the highest type of liberation. Lord Brahma told him that Sri Kshetra is manifested by the Supreme Lord's internal potency and that the Supreme Lord manifests Himself. Therefore, he could not install the Lord here. Lord Jagannath and his abode are eternally situated in the material world. He said he would install the flag on the temple that anyone who sees this flag and offers prostrated obeisances would easily be liberated.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Jagannath came to him in a dream and told him that I shall come floating from the sea in my wooden form as Daru Brahman."
**Summary:** King Indra Dhyumna's frustration leads to a dream where Lord Jagannath promises to appear as Daru Brahman, leading to the discovery of the wood and the involvement of Vishwavasu and the establishment of Narasimha Deva.

After a while, King Indra Dhyumna became a monk. King Indra Dhyumna became frustrated with not seeing Neela Madhava. He decided to lay on a bed of Kusha grass and to fast until death. Lord Jagannath came to him in a dream and told him that, "I shall come floating from the sea in my wooden form as Daru Brahman." The king went to the seashore and saw a huge piece of wood which had the marks of a conch, club, disk, and lotus on it. Many men and elephants tried to move Daru Brahman, but they could not move him. That night, Lord Jagannath spoke to Indra Dhyumna in a dream and told him to bring Vishwavasu who used to serve Neela Madhava and bring a golden chariot in front of Daru Brahman. The king did this and Daru Brahman easily was placed on the chariot. Lord Brahma then performed a sacrifice and established a deity of Narasimha Deva on the raised platform of the sacrificial arena. It is said that the deity of Narasimha in the present temple compound that is on the western side of the Mukti Mandapa is the original Narasimha deity. King Indra Dhyumna had the best sculptors come to carve the deity of Lord Jagannath from Daru Brahman. As soon as they started, their chisels broke to pieces. Vishwakarma, the architect of the demigods, assumed a form of an old brahmana and came to Indra Dhyumna. He offered to carve the deities

**Summary:** Vishwakarma appears as an old brahmana to carve the deities, but the king opens the doors prematurely, revealing the unfinished forms, which Lord Jagannath explains as part of his pastime, establishing the roles of different lineages in his service.

behind closed doors for 21 days. The old sculptor then took Daru Brahman into the temple and the doors were closed. After 14 days passed, the king could not hear any sounds of the artist's tools and he became fully anxious. The king then personally opened the door of the temple by force. The king did not see the sculptor, but instead he saw the three forms of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Lord Balarama. Their fingers and toes were unfinished. Thinking himself a great offender, the king decided to give up his life. He then laid on a bed of kushagras and began to fast. Lord Jagannath appeared to him in a dream. Lord Jagannath told the king, "I am eternally situated here in Nilachala in the form of Lord Jagannath as Daru Brahman. I have no material hands and feet, but with my transcendental senses I accept all the items offered by my devotees. The fact that you broke your promise is a part of the pastime for me to manifest in the form of Jagannath. Those devotees whose eyes are smeared with the salve of love will always see me as Shamasundara holding a flute." The king then prayed to Lord Jagannath that those in the family of the sculptor who manifested his form will continue to assist in constructing the three karts, the three rathas. He also told the king that the descendants of Vishwavasu who served him as Neelamadhava should generation after generation serve the Lord. They shall be called Daitas. The descendants of Vidyavati born from his brahmana wife should perform the deity worship. The descendants born from his shabara wife Lalitha should cook the Lord's food. King Indrajumna then requested Lord Jagannath that the doors of the temple should be closed only three hours a day. The king also requested that he would not have any descendants so that no one in the future would claim the temple of Lord Jagannath as their own property. This is the story

of the appearance of Lord Jagannath. Now there is also a description of Jagannath being the ecstatic form of Lord Krishna himself. Once during a solar eclipse Krishna, Balaram, Subhadra, and other residents of Dwarka went to bathe in a holy pond at Kurukshetra. Knowing that Krishna would be there Srimati Radharani, Krishna's parents Nanda Nishoda, and other residents of Vrindavan who were burning in the fire of separation from the Lord went to meet him. Inside one of the many tents the pilgrims had set up at Kurukshetra Rohini, Lord Balaram's mother, narrated Krishna's Vrindavan pastimes to the queens of Dwarka and other Dwarka Nivasis. The residents of Dwarka are said to be in the mood of opulence or Aishwarya and they worship Krishna as the Supreme Lord. But the residents of Vrindavan are in the mood of sweetness, Madhurya and they have a confidential relationship with Krishna that surpasses awe and reverence because it is based on friendship and love. Rohini's narration was thus extremely confidential so she posted Subhadra at the door to prevent anyone from entering. Krishna and Balaram came to the door and stood on Subhadra's left and right sides. While listening to Rohini's narration of Krishna's intimate Vrindavan pastimes Krishna and Balaram became ecstatic and their internal feelings were exhibited externally. Their eyes became dilated. Their limbs became retracted. Seeing these transformations in Krishna and Balaram Subhadra also became ecstatic and assumed a similar form. Thus, by hearing about Krishna's pastimes in Vrindavan Krishna and Balaram with Subhadra in between displayed their ecstatic forms of Jagannath, Baladeva, and Subhadra.

**Summary:** Narada's prayer leads to Krishna's appearance as Jagannath in Jagannath Puri, emphasizing the Lord's role as Patitapavana and the potential for liberation through seeing the deity.

When the sage Narada saw Krishna transformed as Jagannath he prayed to the Lord to appear like this again. Although the Lord is not obliged to anyone he reciprocates with his devotees to fulfil their desires. Thus, just as Krishna appeared as Neela Madhava to satisfy Vishwavasu he appeared in the Deity form as Jagannath and resides in Jagannath Puri to satisfy the desire of Narada Muni. This special form of Krishna is also known as Patitapavana, the saviour of the fallen, and anyone who takes his audience with proper consciousness is awarded spiritual liberation. It is said in the Narada Purana in that great abode known as Purushottam Kshetra which is rarely achieved among all the three worlds the Keshava Deity who was fashioned by the Supreme Lord himself is situated.

they are easily able to go to the Lord's abode. There is also a narration in the Krishna book about the origin of Jagannath Rathayatra. Once upon a time while Lord Krishna and Balarama were living peacefully in their great city of Dwaraka there was the rare occasion of a full solar eclipse such as takes place at the end of every Kalpa or day of Brahma. By astronomical calculation people were informed about this great eclipse prior to its taking place. Therefore everyone both men and women decided to assemble at the holy place in Kurukshetra known as Samantapanjaka. After arriving in Kurukshetra the members of the Yadu dynasty took their baths ceremoniously with self-control as enjoined in the Shastras and they observed fasting for the whole period of the eclipse in order to nullify the reactions of their sinful activities. The ceremonial functions performed by the members of the Yadu dynasty externally resemble the ritualistic ceremonies performed by the Karmis. When a Karmi performs some ritualistic ceremonies ambition is self-gratification, good position, good wife, good house, good children, or good wealth. But the ambition of the members of the Yadu dynasty was different. Their ambition was to offer Krishna perpetual devotion with faith.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as Krishna became visible to them they took him inside their hearts through their eyes and embraced him to their full satisfaction."
**Summary:** The arrival of Nanda Maharaj and the residents of Vrindavan, especially the gopis, at Kurukshetra is described, highlighting the gopis' intense love for Krishna and the ecstasy they experience upon seeing him after a long separation.

All the members of the Yadu dynasty were great devotees of Krishna. When Nanda Maharaj and other residents of Vrindavan had heard that Krishna would be present in Kurukshetra because of the solar eclipse and that all the members of the Yadu dynasty would also be there they had immediately prepared to go there. King Nanda accompanied by his cowherd men had loaded all their necessary paraphernalia and bullock carts and all of their Vrindavan residents had come to Kurukshetra to see their beloved sons Lord Balaram and Lord Krishna. When the cowherd men of Vrindavan arrived in Kurukshetra all the Yadu dynasty members were most pleased. As soon as they saw the residents of Vrindavan they stood up to welcome them and appeared to have regained their life. All the Yadus and Vrindavan residents had been very eager to meet each other and when they actually came forward and met they embraced one another to their heart's satisfaction and remained in embrace for a considerable time. As far as the gopis of Vrindavan were concerned from the very beginning of their lives they did not know anything beyond Krishna. Krishna and Balaram were their life and soul. The gopis were so attached to Krishna that they could not even tolerate not seeing him momentarily when their eyelids blinked and impeded their vision. They condemned Brahma the creator of the body because he foolishly made eyelids which blinked and checked their seeing Krishna. Because they had been separated from Krishna for so many years the gopis having come along with Nanda Maharaj and Mother Yashoda felt intense ecstasy upon seeing Krishna. No one can imagine how eager the gopis were to see Krishna again. As soon as Krishna became visible to them they took him inside their hearts through their eyes and embraced him to their full satisfaction. Even though they were embracing Krishna only mentally they became so ecstatic and overwhelmed with joy that for the time being

they completely forgot themselves. The ecstatic trance they achieved simply by mentally embracing Krishna is impossible to achieve even for great yogis constantly engaged in meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krishna could understand that the gopis were wrapped in ecstasy by embracing him in their minds and therefore since he is present in everyone's heart he reciprocated the embracing from within. Krishna was sitting with Mother Yashoda and his other mothers Devaki and Rohini but when the mothers engaged in talking he took the opportunity and went to a secluded place to meet the gopis. As soon as he approached the gopis the Lord smiled and after embracing them and inquiring about their welfare he began to encourage them saying, "My dear friends you know that Lord Balaram and I left Rundhavan just to please our relatives and family members. Thus we were long engaged in fighting with our enemies and were obliged to forget you who were so much attached to me in love and affection. I can understand that I have been ungrateful to you but still I know that you are faithful to me. May I inquire if you have been thinking of us although we had to leave you behind? My dear gopis do you not dislike remembering me considering me to have been ungrateful to you? Do you take my misbehavior with you very seriously? Fortunately you have developed loving affection for me which is the only way to achieve the transcendental position of association with me." Lord Krishna concluded by saying, "Unalloyed devotional service and affection for me are the cause of supreme liberation."

**Summary:** The gopis express their desire for Krishna to remain in their hearts, highlighting their preference for the Vrindavan atmosphere, and the lecture connects this to Lord Chaitanya's Rathayatra festival as a means of bringing Krishna back to Vrindavan.

The gopis responded to Krishna by saying, "My dear Krishna we therefore request that you remain within our hearts as the rising sun that will be your greatest benediction." The gopis are always liberated souls because they are always in Krishna consciousness. They only pretended to be entangled in the household affairs in Vrindavan. Because of their separation from Krishna he might have asked them to return with him to Dwarka but the inhabitants of Vrindavan the gopis were not interested in the idea of going with Krishna to Dwarka. They wanted to remain in Vrindavan and thus feel the presence of Krishna in every step of their lives. This transcendental emotional existence of the gopis is the basic principle of Lord Chaitanya's teachings. The Rathayatra festival observed by Lord Chaitanya is the emotional process of taking Krishna back to Vrindavan. Srimati Radharani refused to go with Krishna to Dwarka to enjoy his company in the atmosphere of royal opulence for she wanted to enjoy his company in the original Vrindavan atmosphere. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Yudhishthira's rule, religious principles, ideal king

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Primarily because Yudhishthira was a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with an introduction to the tenth chapter of the first canto, focusing on Yudhishthira's rule and his adherence to religious principles as an ideal king.

In this session we will be discussing from the first verse of the tenth chapter of the first canto. This is a new chapter. The chapter is entitled Departure of Lord Krishna for Dwaraka. The first verse. The meaning of this first verse is as follows: Shravana Kamuni asked, "After killing his enemies who desire to usurp his rightful inheritance, how did the greatest of all religious men, Maharaj Yudhishthira, assisted by his brothers, rule his subjects? Surely he could not freely enjoy his kingdom with unrestricted consciousness." The previous chapter described that Yudhishthira Maharaj executed the royal power after assuming the throne of Hastinapura, becoming the emperor of the world. He ruled strictly according to the codes and religious principles given in the Dharma Shastra, approved by his uncle Dhritarashtra, and confirmed by Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So now the question is being raised by Savanaka Rishi: How did he rule his subjects, assisted by his brothers? So in the Mahabharata there is an elaborate description, and briefly it is described in this chapter, how Yudhishthira was the ideal king.

**Key Quote:** "Ultimately it is the Supreme Lord who is the maintainer of everyone in the material world and the spiritual world."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Krishna's role as the maintainer of the universe and how scarcity arises from mismanagement rather than a lack of resources provided by Krishna.

Primarily because Yudhishthira was a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. The very conception is that the king is the representative of the Supreme Lord. Ultimately it is the Supreme Lord who is the maintainer of everyone in the material world and the spiritual world. So when Krishna is the maintainer, nobody should have any scarcity because Krishna is unlimitedly opulent, and he provides for everyone. But in human society there is scarcity sometimes only because of mismanagement. Misuse, abuse, these are the reasons why there is apparently some scarcity.

**Key Quote:** "So therefore, Krishna provides in plenty."
**Summary:** The speaker uses examples of a mango tree and a jackfruit tree to illustrate how Krishna provides abundantly in nature.

Otherwise, by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord, there is plenty, there is plenty. It is like you consider a small seed of any particular fruit. Now you sow that seed, you get a huge tree, and that tree keeps on giving fruits for several decades. I know of a mango tree near our temple in Mysore, where the gentleman whose house that tree is presently standing, he says it gives 20,000 mangoes in the season. And that tree, mango tree, one mango tree was planted by his great-grandfather, as he has heard from his parents and grandparents. So this is Krishna's creation. A jackfruit tree, the jackfruit itself is so big. One jackfruit, even one family cannot eat. And a jackfruit tree gives so many fruits in the season. So we have known, people who have jackfruit tree, who are not commercially minded, they give away jackfruits to temples, to neighbors, to relatives, and still they are not able to exhaust. How much can a person eat? We have limited capacity to eat. So therefore, Krishna provides in plenty. Krishna provides in plenty.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna provides in plenty."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the Food Corporation of India to further illustrate the abundance provided by Krishna, while also highlighting how mismanagement can lead to perceived scarcity.

Another example I can give, practical example, the Food Corporation of India is meant to store food grains for preventing any famine or any calamity, that there will be no food grains. The stored food grains will be released by the government. Now the godowns of the Food Corporation of India are over-flooded with grains. So much so that, there was a report in the newspaper, the wagons, the railway wagons which bring the food grains after the harvest, after the government procures from the farmers, the wagons bring to the godowns of the Food Corporation of India, and because the godowns are full, the wagons are not emptied. And the wagons are lying in the yard, railway yard, and the grains are getting spoiled, because there is no place to store them. So if this is the quantity of food grains that is there in stock, and everywhere the shops are selling grains, there are plenty of grains. There are plenty of grains. So, there is no scarcity, because Krishna is providing everybody. But then, due to sinful activities, due to mismanagement, due to abuse, misuse of the natural resources,

**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira is one who strictly follows all the religious principles."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Yudhishthira's strict adherence to religious principles and contrasts his divine nature with Duryodhana's demoniac nature.

sometimes there is scarcity. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj, he was perfectly ruling according to, strictly according to religious principles. Now, here, one word is used, dharma-bhritam-varishthah. He is one of those who strictly follow religious principles. He is the greatest among them. Yudhishthira Maharaj. And when he was ruling, then there is no question of any scarcity, any difficulty, any problem for the people. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Maharaj Yudhishthira was the greatest of all men of religion. Thus, he was not at all inclined to fight with his cousins for the sake of enjoying the kingdom." This is a very important point. Yudhishthira never wanted to fight with his cousins for the sake of, with Duryodhana and party, for the sake of enjoying the kingdom. Then why did he fight at all in the battle of Kurukshetra? He fought for the right cause because the kingdom of Hastinapura was his rightful inheritance, and his cousins wanted to usurp it for themselves. See, the clear contrast between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana. Yudhishthira is one who strictly follows all the religious principles. Duryodhana is demoniac minded, demoniac nature.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna clearly says the difference between divine nature and demoniac nature."
**Summary:** The speaker references the Bhagavad Gita to explain the difference between divine and demoniac natures, highlighting that Yudhishthira fought for justice under Krishna's guidance.

So, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna clearly says the difference between divine nature and demoniac nature. He says, Krishna says, divine nature, people, they follow the injunctions of the scriptures and the spiritual authorities. This is divine nature. And those of demoniac or asuric nature, they do not follow the regulated principles as laid down in the scriptures, but they act according to their own whimsical, physical mind. This is the clear distinction between divine nature and demoniac nature. So, Duryodhana was demoniac nature and Yudhishthira was divine nature. So, because Yudhishthira was divine nature, he strictly followed all the regulations of the scriptures. So, therefore, there was no scarcity at all. It will be described in the later verses how the citizens under the rule of Yudhishthira Maharaj enjoyed everything in plenty. So, the fight on the battlefield of Kurukshetra between the Pandavas and Kauravas was justified on the basis of Yudhishthira because Yudhishthira fought for the sake of justice, and Yudhishthira fought for the right cause

under the guidance of Lord Krishna. He fought under the guidance of Lord Krishna. In fact, Yudhishthira Maharaj tried to negotiate things for peace. But Duryodhana would not give even five villages for the five brothers, Pandava brothers, which was a rightful claim. The whole kingdom was a rightful claim. But when the Pandavas reduced their request to five villages to avoid the war, the battle, but Duryodhana would not give. So, obstinacy of Duryodhana. He was, Duryodhana was overconfident. Oh, we are going to win the battle. We are very powerful. He was making all sorts of material calculations. Foolish Duryodhana never understood Krishna is on the side of the Pandavas because Pandavas are devotees. And Duryodhana being demoniac-natured, he will never understand what is Krishna's plan. And everything goes according to Krishna's plan. Nothing goes according to anybody else's wishes or plans. No. Everything goes on according to the plan of Krishna. So, it is the plan of Krishna that the demoniac-natured Duryodhana and his party should be completely vanquished, and the thoroughly righteous religious principled Yudhishthira should be enthroned as the emperor of the world. This was Krishna's plan, and this was to be executed.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes by highlighting the guaranteed victory of the Pandavas due to Krishna's presence and emphasizing Yudhishthira's sense of responsibility even after winning the battle.

So, it was all arranged by Krishna. Therefore, the Pandavas were guaranteed victory actually, even before the battle started. As I mentioned earlier also, the last verse of the Bhagavad Gita in the 18th chapter says, Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna Yatra Partho Dhanurdharaha Tatra Shri Vijayobhutir Dhruvanitir Matirmama. Even before the battle begins, Sanjaya predicts that victory belongs to the Pandavas because Krishna and Arjuna are on the side of the Pandavas. So, therefore, here it is explained Yudhishthira Maharaj he won the battle but he could not enjoy the results of victory he could not enjoy the results of victory with unrestricted consciousness. That's what is mentioned here. Saunaka Rishi is telling, "Surely he could not enjoy freely his kingdom with unrestricted consciousness." He was always conscious of his responsibility and duty. As was explained in the previous chapter, the duty of the king is to care for the citizens for their spiritual upliftment. So, how did he rule? Saunaka Rishi wanted to know how did he rule? He wanted to hear the glories of the rule of King Yudhishthira, and that will be explained in the next few verses. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "The living being's constitutional position is one of serving a superior."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport on the living being's constitutional position as a servant, forced to serve the illusory energy in pursuit of sense gratification.

Satsangana Muktadussangohatum Notsahate Budhaha This verse further explains the feeling of separation especially the Pandavas felt when Krishna left Hastinapura and returned to Dwaraka. The Pandavas were very, very intimately associated with Krishna. So the general principle is first explained and then the specific feeling of the Pandavas is explained because they were intimately connected with Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains this point how somebody is attached to Krishna then what is the position of such a person. The living being's constitutional position is one of serving a superior. This is the purport Srila Prabhupada is writing. The living being's constitutional position is one of serving a superior. He is obliged to serve by force the dictates of illusory energy in different phases of sense gratification. What is our life in this world? It is one of sense gratification. We are always seeking satisfaction of our senses. Now in doing so we are forced by the illusory energy to serve maya. We are forced by maya to serve maya. That we don't realize. That we don't understand because of the influence of illusion only. So therefore the statement by Prabhupada in the beginning of the purport is that it is our constitutional position. The way we are made.

**Key Quote:** "And there is no hope of release from such bondage generally."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the futility of trying to satisfy the senses, emphasizing how this pursuit leads to entanglement in the laws of karma and material bondage.

We have to serve a superior. We cannot be master. We are always servant. Nobody likes to hear this. Nobody wants to be a servant. Everyone wants to be master. But our position is we are servant. And if we don't agree to render service we are forced to render service by the illusory energy. But the real fact of the matter is that the conditioned soul, the ordinary living beings in this world are never tired in serving their senses. Because they are running after sense enjoyment. to become tired of serving the senses even if somebody may feel tired serving their own senses the illusory energy perpetually forces him to do so without being satisfied now these are some of the very important truths that Prabhupada is revealing in this purport please hear very attentively and think about this contemplate on this that the Maya's force is so powerful that there is no respite for us we to keep on serving our senses with the false hope that this particular act of serving the senses is a false hope that this particular act of serving the senses will satisfy me but the reality is I never get satisfied on the other hand my the senses demand more and more and more and more and foolishly a person may go on trying and trying and trying to satisfy the senses it never happens now as a result of this attempt at satisfying the senses the conditioned soul becomes entangled you understand what is entanglement material bondage we have bound up completely bound up through the stringent laws of karma we will be bound through the laws of karma And there is no hope of release from such bondage generally.

**Key Quote:** "Only way such an entangled soul can get release from this entanglement or bondage is by association with pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that association with pure devotees awakens transcendental consciousness, allowing one to understand their true position as a servant of Krishna rather than the perverted senses.

Now the only way such an entangled soul can get release from this entanglement or bondage is by association with pure devotees. Only way. What happens when somebody is in the association of pure devotees? As it is said here, By association with pure devotees, one is gradually promoted to transcendental consciousness, spiritual consciousness, Krishna consciousness. Thus, when a person comes to the spiritual consciousness, Then, such a person can understand that his eternal position is to render service to Krishna, and not render service to the perverted senses. These senses of ours are actually not our real senses. Our real senses are within. These senses are a covering for the real senses, the spiritual senses. So, these material senses which are covering our spiritual senses, they demand satisfaction, and foolishly, we go on trying to satisfy. But, we don't realize, except when we come in touch with pure devotees, and our transcendental consciousness is awakened, and then we are able to understand, I am simply serving lust, anger, greed, enviousness. All these material desires, I am simply serving them. Kama, krodha, loba, moha, madha, vatsarya. We are simply servant of all these different perverted desires.

**Key Quote:** "Material society, friendship, and love are all different phases of lust. Kama, lust, is the greatest enemy of the soul, of every conditioned soul."
**Summary:** The speaker identifies lust as the greatest enemy and explains how material attachments lead to threefold miseries, emphasizing that hearing Krishna Katha in the association of devotees can diminish material desires.

Simply serving them. So, Prabhupada explains further, Material society, friendship, and love are all different phases of lust. Kama, lust, is the greatest enemy of the soul, of every conditioned soul. The greatest enemy is lust, kama. Viddhi, enam, iya, vairinam. In the Bhagavad Gita, third chapter, it is described by Krishna. It is the greatest enemy of all of us, who are in this material world. It is lust. And, it is further explained, Home, country, family, society, wealth, all are causes of bondage in the material world. And, the concomitant factors of such bondage is the three-fold miseries of life. Tapatraya. Three kinds of miseries. Miseries due to our own body and mind, miseries due to other living beings, and miseries due to forces of nature. We have to keep on suffering. Different miseries at different times, due to the bondage. Now, if somebody is associated with pure devotees, and hears Krishna Katha submissively, then the attachment for material enjoyment becomes slackened. That which is a burning desire in the heart, that burning desire begins to get extinguished.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how attraction to Krishna increases through association with devotees and hearing Krishna Katha, leading to progress in Krishna consciousness and highlighting the Pandavas' intense feelings of separation from Krishna.

When you are associated with pure devotees, and hear Krishna Katha from them. Then, gradually, the attraction for hearing more and more about Krishna, that increases, it increases and becomes prominent. Now, as the attraction for Krishna increases, one keeps on making progress more and more in Krishna consciousness. And, the attraction keeps on increasing more and more. Now, it is said here that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari, is so transcendentally attractive, that even those who are self-satisfied by self-realization, even those who are liberated completely from all material bondage, they also, become devotees of Lord Hari. This is the power of attraction. Supreme Lord Hari, is attractive to everyone, including liberated souls, and those who are self-satisfied due to self-realization. Everyone is attracted to Krishna. That is the power of Krishna. So, under these circumstances, we can easily understand, the Pandavas who were constant companions of Krishna, how they would have felt when Krishna left Hastinapura and went to Dwaraka. So, we can't imagine, the kind of feeling of separation felt by the Pandavas especially,

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the power of attachment to Krishna, describing how pure devotees can forget material attachments through remembrance of Krishna and highlighting Krishna's special affection for His devotees.

when Krishna left for Dwaraka. But, Prabhupada concludes by telling that, because of continuous personal contact, the Pandavas were feeling intense separation when Krishna left. We can't imagine how much separation they would have felt. Now, the nature of the attachment for Krishna, which the pure devotees have, is described as so very attractive. Krishna is so very attractive for pure devotees, that simply the remembrance of Krishna's name, form, or qualities, or pastimes, or paraphernalia, simply remembering that, makes the devotee, completely forget about all other material forms, material names, material qualities, material activities. Everything material, completely is forgotten by the devotee. So, mukta dusanga, a pure devotee is always free from the contaminating association of the material world. Even though the devotee may be the material world. So, it is always possible, by developing that attraction for Krishna, and, awakening that intimate attachment, that simply remembering Krishna is enough, to, again experience that same feeling, especially in the physical absence of Krishna. This is very important. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna. Only the devotees can play the part of the Lord's relatives, and the Lord is always absolute. He is not particularly partial to His relatives, and He is neglectful about other people, indifferent to other people. No. He is always equal to everybody, but His devotees, He has got some special affection. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "But that is not the case with attachment to Krishna, attraction for Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the superficial and temporary nature of material feelings with the eternal and spiritual nature of attachment to Krishna, highlighting how material suffering fades with time while love for Krishna is everlasting.

What happened to all those? Those who were attached to Krishna when Krishna left Hastinapura. That is being described here. They felt so much of separation. They were constantly looking at Krishna without blinking their eyes, constantly staring at him. And they don't know what to do, how to even continue their normal activities in the absence of Krishna. So, within the core of their heart they were feeling that, we are going to miss Krishna. It's not a superficial feeling. Unlike material feelings, it's all superficial. Because we know, our experience says in this material world, however much somebody will be afflicted by some pain, or suffering, they can be pacified. Or they tend to forget that in course of time. Sometimes they say time is the best healer of some pain of suffering or loss or bereavement, somebody suffers. With time they forget that. But that is not the case with attachment to Krishna, attraction for Krishna.

Krishna is not having any material relationship with anyone. It's only spiritual relationship, spiritual attraction. So, therefore it is different.

Krishna is the chief among all the eternal conscious beings, living beings. Krishna is the chief, the topmost and the supreme. He alone is the maintainer of the many eternals.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that submissively hearing the Bhagavatam from pure devotees awakens one's eternal relationship with Krishna.

Please, hear carefully. There were hundreds of ladies in the palace of Hastinapura. All of them were affectionate to Krishna. How did they become affectionate to Krishna? All of them were relatives also. When they saw Krishna was going away from the palace for his native place, they were very anxious for him. And, as usual, tears began to roll down their cheeks because there was so much attraction. So, they were very anxious for Krishna. They had so much affection for him, Krishna. They thought at the same time that tears at the time of Krishna's departure might be a cause of misfortune for Krishna. Therefore, they wanted to check them. But that was very difficult for them because the tears could not be checked.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the descriptions of love for Krishna with material relationships, emphasizing the temporary, superficial, and conditional nature of material attachments, which ultimately bewilder the soul.

Now, it is explained here that because it was difficult to stop their tears from flowing from their eyes, so they simply smeared their tears in their eyes and their hearts were throbbing with that intense feeling of separation from Krishna. Now, these descriptions are significant because we can compare this with the kind of material relationships and attachments we have in this world, which is completely temporary. It is superficial. It is conditional. It will exist only as long as the body exists. And it is bewildering for the soul. All such material relationships are just bewilderment for the soul, for the conditioned soul. So, there is no real value for that attachment or that relationship or some feelings. There is no value. These material feelings, material relationships, material attachments, no value other than simply make us bewildered, that's all. Entangle us in this material world.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's transcendental nature and the eternal relationship we have with Him, explaining that even those who didn't have direct contact with Krishna developed intense affection through hearing and discussing His qualities and activities.

Whereas, Krishna is a transcendental personality. He is the transcendental personality. We are all spiritual beings. We have an eternal relationship with him. And in that eternal relationship, we are intimately attached and connected very intensely with Krishna. Now, Prabhupada says, the ladies who were the wives and daughters-in-law of those who died in the battlefield never came in direct contact with Krishna. That was the culture those days. Women, they don't directly contact men except their own husband or their father like that, other than them. Other men, they will not directly contact. So, how is it that without direct contact with Krishna, they had so much of attachment for Krishna? How is it possible? That is explained here by Srila Prabhupada. All of them heard of Krishna and his great activities. And thus, they thought of him. They talked about him. They discussed about his name, fame, qualities, activities, past times, etc. And in that way, they developed affection for him. Like the people who are in direct contact with Krishna. To the same degree, they developed intense feeling of love for Krishna. Just like those who are in direct touch with Krishna developed that feeling.

So, it is said here. Therefore, directly or indirectly, anyone who thinks of Krishna, anyone who talks about Krishna, anyone who worships Krishna becomes attached to Krishna. This is a fact. So, don't practice bhakti as some mechanical thing, as some mechanical activity. Just like when we chant Hare Krishna on a daily basis. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Don't do it so mechanically. It comes in the way of our progress in developing, re-establishing our relationship with Krishna. It comes in the way. So, Krishna is absolute. There is no difference between his name, form, quality, past times, etc. No difference. That's the meaning of absolute. So, therefore, simply by hearing about Krishna, simply by talking of Krishna, about Krishna, simply by reading about Krishna in the Bhagavatam, simply by thinking of Krishna, simply by remembering his past times, we can revive our relationship of Krishna. Our relationship with Krishna is revived that way. It's a very, very powerful technique. And the best method that is recommended in this age.

#### description of Krishna's departure, royal customs, shyness of women

**Key Quote:** "Shyness is a particular extra-natural beauty of the fair sex, and it commands respect from the opposite sex."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's departure from Hastinapura, the royal send-off he received, and introduces the concept of shyness as a virtue in women, setting the stage for Prabhupada's explanation.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 15th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. वीना पणव गोमुखाह धुन्धुरी आनक घंटाध्या नेदुर धुन्धुभयस्तथा. The meaning of this verse is, while the Lord was departing from the palace of Hastinapura, different types of drums like the mridanga, dhol, nagra, dhundhuri and dhundubhi, and flutes of different types, the veena, gomukha, and bheri, all sounded together to show him honour. So, as the title of the chapter suggests, this is the description of the departure of Lord Krishna for Dwaraka from Hastinapura. So, when the Lord was departing from the palace of Hastinapura, he was given a very nice send-off. So, it is a royal custom in the palace that all these wonderful instruments are played like a band to show him honour. He is the supreme Lord. Not only that, he was visiting as a guest of Yudhishthira Maharaj. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj was seeing off the Lord, Lord Krishna. He was very pleased to arrange this band for showing the honour to Krishna. The next verse, 16th verse. So, the meaning of this 16th verse. Out of a loving desire to see the Lord, the royal ladies of the Kurus got up on top of the palace, and smiling with affection and shyness, they showered flowers upon the Lord. So, Krishna was seen off by all the residents of the palace, and the other citizens also, when he was leaving Hastinapura to return to Dwaraka. So, particularly mention is made here in this verse of the royal ladies of the palace of Hastinapura. They got up on top of the palace, because in those days there was no free mixing of men and women. A very highly cultured society was present then. And these ladies, to see the Lord, they went on top of the palace, and from there, while smiling with affection and shyness, these ladies showered flowers upon the Lord. So, this particular quality of the ladies, shyness, particularly this shyness, is explained by Prabhupada very nicely in the purport. So, let us hear Prabhupada. What does he say about the shyness?

#### shyness of women, Vedic culture, respect, material vs. spiritual beauty

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A sweeper woman commanded the respect of many respectable gentlemen simply by manifesting a lady's shyness."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's explanation of shyness as a natural beauty in women that commands respect, contrasting it with the lack of respect for immodesty, and emphasizing the historical presence of this cultural value in India.

Prabhupada says, "Shyness is a particular extra-natural beauty of the fair sex, and it commands respect from the opposite sex." Women naturally have got this shyness, and it is a quality that deserves to be respected by the men. So, it is said here by Srila Prabhupada further, "This custom was observed even during the days of the Mahabharata." It is more than 5000 years ago. "Only the less intelligent persons not well-versed in the history of the world say that observance of separation of female from male is an introduction of the Mohammedan period in India." This is not correct. That the separation of female from males, some people say that it is an introduction of the Mughal or Mohammedan period in India. That is not correct. As is evident from this record in the Srimad Bhagavatam and the Mahabharata, it is very clear that even in the days 5000 years back, there was this separation of the men and women. There was no free mixing. And it is a very important point to be noted. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "This incident from the Mahabharata period proves definitely that the ladies of the palace observed strict parda, restricted association with men. And instead of coming down in the open air where Lord Krishna and others were assembled, the ladies of the palace went up on top of the palace and from there paid their respects to Lord Krishna by showers of flowers." So, they showed their respect. They maintained the distance. At the same time, the respect that was being given was very evident by their action, showering flowers upon the Lord. It is definitely stated here in this verse that the ladies were smiling there on the top of the palace, checked by shyness. Both are mentioned. Prema vrida smitekshanaha. Now, prema is out of affection and love. Vrida is glancing with shyness. So, Prabhupada particularly comments about this shyness, that this shyness is a gift of nature to the fair sex, and it enhances their beauty and prestige, even if they are of a less important family, or even if they are less attractive. It's a very important point. Women generally are more attractive than men, but in case, in some instances, women are not so attractive, but still shyness enhances their beauty, and even their prestige. So, this, Srila Prabhupada explains further, "We have practical experience of this fact." And what is that experience that Prabhupada is narrating here? "A sweeper woman commanded the respect of many respectable gentlemen simply by manifesting a lady's shyness." Prabhupada is talking of his times, say about 80 years back. The sweeper woman, who is not very, not a high class lady, but still, because of her shyness, she was commanding the respect of even big gentlemen in the society. On the other hand, Prabhupada comments, "Half naked ladies in the street do not command any respect, but a shy sweeper's wife commands respect from all." So, shyness is such an important quality for a woman.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The real beauty is within and the real beauty belongs to the soul, not to the body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material beauty is an illusion, as the body is made of temporary elements, and that true beauty lies within the spirit soul, urging listeners to not be attracted by false, external beauty.

And it is very, very important. Human civilization as conceived of by the sages of India is to help one free himself from the clutches of illusion. Everyone here in this material world, men, women of whichever class, whichever standard, are all in the clutches of maya, illusion, as conditioned souls. But, the sages are instructing us to lead a particular lifestyle to become free from these clutches of the illusory energy. The material beauty of a woman is an illusion because actually the body is made of earth, water, fire, air, etc. But because there is association of the living spark with matter, this material body appears to be beautiful. Kindly note this carefully, that a woman appears attractive only because the material body is actually in contact with the living spark, the life due to the spirit soul within the body. And Prabhupada gives an example to illustrate this. No one is attracted by an earthen doll even if it is the most perfectly prepared doll to attract the attention of others. You have seen mannequins in stores which sell, let's say, some garments. They dress up a doll of a woman very nicely. Now, everyone knows this doll is actually lifeless and nobody is attracted to such a doll. So, therefore, the dead body has no beauty because no one will accept the dead body of a so-called beautiful woman. Therefore, the conclusion is that the spirit spark is beautiful and because of the soul's beauty, one is attracted by the beauty of the outward body. So, the real beauty is within and the real beauty belongs to the soul, not to the body. Therefore, the lesson to be learnt is the Vedic wisdom forbids us to be attracted by false beauty. Don't be attracted by material beauty. Don't be attracted by external beauty.

#### restricted mixing of men and women, maya, shyness, ephemeral beauty, spiritual progress

**Key Quote:** "The sages of the Vedic civilization, they say that the woman is considered to be like fire and the man is considered to be butter."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the Vedic restriction on mixing of men and women to avoid being trapped by illusion, highlighting shyness as a natural check on unrestricted mixing, and reminding listeners that bodily beauty is fleeting and not the true essence of attraction.

The real beauty is within. But because we are now in the darkness of ignorance, the Vedic civilization allows very restricted mixing of men and women. This restriction is necessary so that we don't become trapped by maya. This is a trap for both men and women. It's not only for men. It's for both. So, the sages of the Vedic civilization, they say that the woman is considered to be like fire and the man is considered to be butter. Butter must melt in the association of fire. Therefore, they may be brought together only when it is necessary. Men and women are brought together only when absolutely essential. And shyness is a check to the unrestricted mixing. A woman's shyness stops this unrestricted mixing of men and women and thereby saves people from becoming trapped by the illusory presentation of maya as something external, as beautiful and attractive. The real beauty is inside, within, of the spirit, not of the body. So, don't be attracted by bodily beauty. And we all know this bodily beauty is highly flickering. It is very, very short-lived. Like somebody, even if however beautiful they are, when they don't take bath, they are not dressed very nicely, neatly, or they are completely fatigued, or they become old, they have wrinkles, or they get injury on their face, then where is the beauty? Beauty is all gone. So, this is ephemeral beauty. This is not real beauty. And to not get trapped by this ephemeral beauty or false beauty, there is restriction in mixing of men and women. And also, this restriction is automatically there when women utilize the characteristic quality of theirs called shyness, and by which the restricted, unrestricted mixing is prevented, and thereby, we don't become trapped by maya. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "when man does not waste his valuable time in producing unwanted things in the name of necessities is a contrast between the civilization that was prevailing 5000 years back and nowadays in the name of necessity so many unwanted things are produced in factories mass produced and people are busy improving upon this mass production artificial uh things not exactly nature's gift"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the use of natural gifts in the past with the mass production of artificial goods in modern industrial society.

So Krishna is leaving the palace of Hastinapura. He is proceeding to Dwaraka. So many different residents of the palace and other citizens have come to see off Krishna. So Arjuna, the intimate friend of Krishna, he is seeing off Krishna. How is he seeing off? He is described here as the great warrior and conqueror of sleep, Gudakeshah, and I would say they have had such a marriage with Krishna, which is why others have written and are grateful here. So this is also about the life of Krishna. And then he says here, were used in the luxurious royal ceremonies. In those days, of course, they are all nature's gifts and are produced by the hills, oceans, etc., by the order of the Lord. When man does not waste his valuable time in producing unwanted things in the name of necessities, is a contrast between the civilization that was prevailing 5000 years back and nowadays. In the name of necessity, so many unwanted things are produced in factories, mass produced, and people are busy improving upon this mass production, artificial things, not exactly nature's gift. So contrast this, the nature's gifts that were utilized about 5000 years back, and what we are producing in the name of advancement of civilization. So Prabhupada says, by so-called development of industrial enterprises, they are now using parts of, describe it in a different way, they don't use metal in manufacturing, they are using some metal like brass, copper, copper, copper in the past, they were called Doch

**Key Quote:** "The slum phenomena is typical of so called advanced civilization."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the decline in the quality of materials used in everyday life and the rise of slums as a consequence of modern civilization.

as like copper copper copper copper copper copper copper copperita but for不過 instead of metals like gold, silver, brass and copper some material, plastic like material, gatta parcha. Of course, this is not so commonly understood nowadays, but during Prabhupada's time, it is said gatta parcha they used to use because that is cheaper and it is accessible to more people. So, all the metal wear has vanished or gradually vanishing or affordable only by rich people. Now, they don't even have brass and copper vessels. Forget about silver and gold. And nowadays, they have just some stainless steel which is iron, and that also is becoming expensive and they have instead all kinds of plastic wear, exactly what Prabhupada is telling here, which are worthless. And Prabhupada also says they are using margarine instead of purified butter. Nobody can afford pure butter or pure ghee which is not even easily available because only the adulterated substitutes are available. That is what is described as margarine. And they even say that pure ghee does not have trans fat. I was reading in one of the descriptions in encyclopedia that margarine has trans fat. Purified ghee has no trans fat. So, purified ghee, pure ghee is a healthy alternative to margarine. So, they can neither afford pure ghee nor is margarine the substitute for ghee very healthy. So, this is the civilization we are living in now and Prabhupada also says one-fourth of the city population has no shelter. This is what they call advancement of civilization. What have they done? They have displaced people from the city. They have displaced people from peacefully living in villages in prosperity to cities and in cities when they come seeking a job or trying to find some employment in factories or all kinds of horrible places then they don't have proper shelter. They don't have shelter. They stay in slums. The slum phenomena is typical of so called advanced civilization. The slum phenomena is typical of so called advanced civilization in modern cities. The slum phenomena is typical of so called advanced civilization in modern cities.

#### Village Life, Quality of Life, Modern Cities, Degradation

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "People should learn to live by nature's gifts."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the simple, healthy life in villages with the congested and degraded quality of life in modern cities, emphasizing the importance of fresh food and natural resources.

In the former times there was no slums at all. Doesn't mean there were no poor people. Poor people used to live in villages in nice cottages built with whatever wood and other leaves, etc. was available very easily. And they would live in a farm as laborers. Plenty of open space, fresh air, nice water. They grow grains and they eat first class food. Even the poorest man. For that matter if you can go to Vrindavan even today. You see those poor people staying in some cottages in the outskirts of the towns and in the villages. and in the villages they prepare always fresh food, they never eat stale food, they prepare fresh food. Even the poorest person will have little wheat flour which they will mix and make a dough and nicely bake a roti, hot fresh roti. The housewife will prepare and serve hot hot to her husband, the poor husband. The poorest of the poor also eat hot chapatis nicely made on fire and they would have also prepared some simple subji. Subji is plenty available. Whatever they can grow or whatever they can purchase for. I heard there used to be vegetables available in season 10 paisa a kilo. I'm telling this about 20 years back. Even today in Vrindavan in the season time vegetables are just one to one rupee a kilo, that's all. The vegetables which are grown in season, off season they are expensive, but nobody eats off season. The traditional people don't eat off season vegetables, they eat only seasonal vegetables which is good for the health and also available in plenty. It grows very easily, the soil is very fertile in Vrindavan. So this is the gift of nature, not eating some artificial things like margarine, cooking in some plastic ware and without a proper shelter in the city or living in congested spaces like birds nest. So many of these so-called high-rise skyscraper buildings people live in very, very, very congested space. So it is, it is the quality of life has degraded. This cannot be denied and this is the reason why we are living in the middle of the world. These are the

#### Economic Development, Land and Cows, Regulated Rainfall, Krishna Consciousness

**Key Quote:** "The basic principle of economic development is centered on land and cows."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's view that economic development should be based on land and cows, emphasizing the importance of regulated rainfall and pleasing Krishna for a prosperous life.

This is what Srila Prabhupada is pointing out. People should learn to live by nature's gifts. And how is it that the nature's gifts are becoming so very scarce? So, Prabhupada explains elsewhere, the basic principle of economic development is centered on land and cows. The necessities of human society are food grains, fruits, milk, minerals, clothing, wood, etc. And these are supplied. How are these supplied? Prabhupada explains during the regime of Maharaja Yudhishthira, all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Very, very important point. Rainfalls are not in the control of human beings. They are regulated by the heavenly king Indradeva, and he is a servant of the supreme lord Krishna. So, when the king and the citizens obey the supreme lord Krishna, then under the king's administration, there will be regulated rainfalls all over the planet earth. And these rains are the causes of varieties of production on the land. Plenty of grains, plenty of vegetables, plenty of fruits. Not only do regulated rains help ample production of grains and fruits, but when they combine with astronomical influences, there is ample production of valuable stones and jewels and pearls. See, this is also dependent on nature. You cannot manufacture valuable stones, precious stones like diamond and rubies and pearls. You cannot manufacture that. That is produced by nature under certain favorable conditions. And that is explained here by Prabhupada. Regulated rainfall combined with astronomical influences result in production of, ample production of valuable stones and pearls. So, if there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruits, enough cotton, enough silk, people can lead a happy and healthy and prosperous life peacefully and actually cultivate Krishna consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "But nature will produce plenty when we please the Supreme Lord by engaging in devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by advocating a return to nature, dependence on natural produce, and engaging in devotional service to please Krishna, leading to a harmonious and prosperous life.

Rather than work like donkeys for getting some very little artificial produce by paying huge amounts of money, which doesn't anyway have value. What kind of civilization is this? So, Prabhupada is suggesting that we return to land and cows and lead a Krishna conscious life. So, then there will be plenty of supply by the order of the Supreme Lord by material nature. We cannot order nature to produce, but nature will produce because nature is controlled by Krishna. And nature will produce plenty when we please the Supreme Lord by engaging in devotional service and living a harmonious life in harmony with nature. Not exploiting nature, killing poor animals, poisoning the soil by putting all kinds of chemicals into the soil. No, that's not the way. So, human beings should actually depend on the production of material nature by following Dharma and by shifting from dependence on factories and artificial production, Anartha, to natural produce of land and crops and cows and regulated rainfall and plenty of all these supplies by nature under the order of the Supreme Lord. So, this is the advice we get from Srila Prabhupada in this particular purport. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "when Krishna was leaving the palace of Hastinapura there were brahmanas who were glorifying Krishna by chanting Vedic hymns and offering benediction to Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 19th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the apparent contradiction of offering benedictions to Krishna, who is the Absolute.

In this session, we will be discussing the 19th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Ashu yantashisha satyah tatra tatra dvijeritah na anuroopa anuroopascha nirgunasya gunatmanah. The meaning of this verse is: It was being heard here and there that the benedictions being paid to Krishna were neither befitting nor unbefitting because they were all for the absolute who was now playing the part of a human being. A very important observation being made is that when Krishna was leaving the palace of Hastinapura, there were brahmanas who were glorifying Krishna by chanting Vedic hymns and offering benediction to Krishna. Now, it is described in this verse that the benedictions that were being offered to Krishna were neither befitting nor unbefitting, so something like a contradiction, it appears as a contradictory statement here.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna was playing the part of a human being though he is not a human being. He is the Supreme Lord always under all circumstances but he is playing the part of a human being."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse, highlighting that Krishna was playing the role of a human being as a guest of Yudhishthira, making the benedictions fitting in that context.

So Prabhupada explains this in the purport very nicely. Why is it being said it was neither befitting nor unbefitting? So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport: At places there were sounds of Vedic benediction at the personality of God is Shri Krishna. The benedictions were fitting in the sense that the Lord was playing the part of a human being as if a cousin of Maharaj Yudhishthira. Krishna appeared as the son of Vasudeva who was the brother of Kuntidevi and Kuntidevi's son was Yudhishthira. So Yudhishthira and Krishna were cousins in terms of relationship, but here it is said because Krishna was playing the part of a human being, though he is not a human being. He is the Supreme Lord always under all circumstances, but he is playing the part of a human being. Therefore, the benedictions were fitting because Yudhishthira is the elder brother of Krishna. So the elder brother arranges to offer benedictions by the qualified brahmanas and the benediction it is accepted which will be offered through chanting of various hymns to the important guest. Krishna has come to the Hastinapura palace as the guest of Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is described as nirguna, nirguna means absolute, without any material qualities. So he is not a human being, he has no material relationship with anybody."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why the benedictions were also unbefitting, because Krishna is absolute (nirguna) and doesn't need material benefits, and that He creates the material world for our sake.

So in that sense, there it is befitting because Krishna was playing the part of a human being, but they were unbefitting because the Lord is absolute, material qualities, material relativities. Now Krishna is described as nirguna, nirguna means absolute, without any material qualities. So he is not a human being, he has no material relationship with anybody. So therefore this benediction is not suited for Krishna, it is only for people of this world who have some kind of material relationships and they want some benedictions because they may utilize those benedictions for their material benefit. Lacking those material benefits, they may desire some benedictions which will help them to get some material benefits. But Krishna is not in need of any material benefit. Krishna has nothing to do with this entire material creation as far as his activities are concerned or his existence is concerned. Then why does he create? He creates for our sake.

**Key Quote:** "And we are foolish to desire material enjoyment while we are entitled to sublime spiritual pleasure in his association."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how humans foolishly seek material happiness instead of spiritual bliss in connection with Krishna, who creates the material world because we insist on trying to enjoy it.

Why does he create? And we are foolish to desire material enjoyment while we are entitled to sublime spiritual pleasure in his association. So foolishly we have turned away from Krishna, foolishly we seek happiness in material pursuits and Krishna because we are his part and parcel, we are his own children. So because we insist, we are adamant, Krishna creates this material world and places us in this material atmosphere, so we can try to enjoy it materially and try to be happy in this way. But intelligent people realize we can never be happy in this material world by pursuit of material pleasures. We can never be happy. We can never be happy, so intelligent persons try to find out the real source of happiness and that is available only in connection with Krishna, unlimited spiritual bliss. Krishna is a reservoir of that and in our relationship with Krishna, spiritual relationship, not material relationship, we can have

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is full of transcendental qualities when it said nirguna doesn't mean that the Absolute Truth Krishna is the absolute personality of God. It doesn't mean when he describes Nirguna that he has no qualities at all."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that 'nirguna' doesn't mean Krishna has no qualities, but rather that He has no material qualities, only transcendental ones, and that the spiritual world is free from the contradictions found in the material world.

unlimited spiritual bliss. So it is said here Krishna is nirguna and there are no material qualities in him, that's why nirguna, no material qualities, but Krishna is full of transcendental qualities. When it's said nirguna, it doesn't mean that the Absolute Truth, Krishna is the absolute truth. This absolute personality of God. It doesn't mean when he describes Nirguna that he has no qualities at all. He has no material qualities, but he is full of transcendental qualities. That's because he is a transcendental personality. So he is transcendental qualities, full of transcendental qualities. In the transcendental world there is nothing contradictory, whereas in the relative world, the world we are staying, it's called relative world. And the transcendental world, the spiritual world where Krishna resides with his pure devotees, that is called the spiritual world, the transcendental world, the absolute world. There are no relativities and there is nothing contradictory. But in this relative world everything has got its opposite. For example, in this world white is the opposite of conception of black. But in the transcendental world there is no distinction between white and black.

**Key Quote:** "In the material world, dark complexion people are considered not so beautiful. Whereas fair complexion people are considered very beautiful. This is the main contradiction."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of beauty standards to illustrate the difference between the material and spiritual worlds, and reiterates that benedictions are meant for conditioned souls, not the liberated Lord.

How do you understand this? In the spiritual world there are very, very, very beautiful personalities, equally beautiful, even though some of them are of white complexion and some of them are of black. Not exactly black, dark blue. Но у каждой Ist karş ConfédлALL halod, these negative qualities are considered very beautiful. In the material world, dark complexion people are considered not so beautiful, whereas fair complexion people are considered very beautiful. This is the main contradiction. world the conception of beauty in the material world in the spiritual world both are very beautiful both are beautiful fair complexion people devotees and dark complexion devotees both both are beautiful so the conception of the material world is different and the reality of the spiritual world is different therefore the sounds of benedictions uttered by the learned brahmanas here and there appear to be contradictory in relation with the absolute person when we try to apply this brahmanas offering benedictions as arranged by Yudhishthira Maharaj to Krishna who is departing you then it is contradictory Krishna doesn't require any benediction he has nothing to do with benedictions all the Vedic statements or Vedic chanting which is meant for offering benedictions chanted by brahmanas are meant for conditioned

**Summary:** The speaker explains that when Vedic hymns and benedictions are offered to Krishna with devotion, they become transcendental and lose their contradictory nature, ultimately glorifying Krishna.

souls, they are not meant for the 100% liberated beings and the supreme Lord, eternally liberated Lord, not meant for him. So in that sense, not befitting, it is that doesn't bifit the Lord, but Prabhupad says here very important point that when such Vedic hymns are apply to the absolute person they look upon them and these hymns are applied to the absolute person they look upon them and they give hope to the clapping of their hands and lose all contradiction and become transcendental. So the same glorification, same sorry, same benedictions when they are offered to Krishna, when they are offered to Krishna in devotion, then they are no longer contradictory, they becomes transcendental. So the Vedas contain glorification of Krishna throughout. Hari Sarvatra Giyate, ultimately the Vedas are glorifying Krishna only and everyone and everything in relationship with Krishna, spiritual relationship, so that is the content of the Vedas ultimately from one perspective if you analyze from an absolute perspective the Vedas are nothing but glorification of Krishna complete whole complete truth absolute truth so when the very hymns are chanted to glorify Krishna then there is no more any contradiction you cannot say it is contradictory it is irrelevant it is unbefitting you cannot say that

**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Krishna being called a thief (Makhan Chaur) to illustrate how seemingly contradictory qualities can exist in the Supreme Lord, because everything is applicable to Him.

you cannot say that it is irrelevant it is unbefitting you cannot say that it is irrelevant it is unbefitting you cannot say that they will contain that and is not right pravudp youtube give an example in the pravudp youtube give an example in the pravudp youtube give an example in the Pürport lot Lord Shree Krishna is described as thief and robber he is very famous among his pure devotees as a impatience banter He stealing butter from the neighbor houses at Prindavan early ages childhood pastimes of Krishna he steal butter from the neighboring houses childhood pastimes of Krishna he steal butter from the neighboring houses since Lord Krishna vegetables he staple he patience to uplift smooth footprints in whatever wise from begin toiyim continuedwas0000000 and 5040 Is there something chocolate is afterward since ال sedikl fifth subis deutsche des 4000 inrst Since then he has become famous as a thief, but in spite of his being famous as a thief, Makhan Chaur, he is worshipped as a thief by his devotees. Whereas, in the mundane world, a thief is punished and never praised. In our material dealings, somebody who steals is never praised, is always condemned and is punished if he is caught stealing. So, why this difference? So, Prabhupada explains, since Krishna is the absolute personality of Godhead, everything is applicable to him and still in spite of all contradictions, he is the Godhead. He is supreme personality of Godhead. So, on the one hand, he is described as a thief, on the other hand, he is worshipped as Makhan Chaur.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that in Vrindavan, Krishna's actions, even stealing, bring pleasure to His devotees, resulting in ever-increasing transcendental bliss, and that everything applied to Krishna becomes transcendental.

So, how can these two things go together? That is because when applied to the Supreme Lord, nothing is contradictory when applied to the Supreme Lord. Because, we should remember, in Vrindavan, Krishna is, why is he stealing? He does not come to the Supreme Lord. Now, Vrindavan is a little different from Vrindavan. If one did not stay there for long, in these many days, to look and use aא sí recovery, who has spent the past, doing elderly, all through such a period of time. What is the result? Putna computers, give them pleasure in reciprocal exchange for their service so all interactions between Krishna and his devotees in the spiritual world simply result in increased ever-increasing transcendental bliss Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says anandam budhi vardhanam prati padam purnam vrata svadanam so this is the spiritual world nothing is contradictory so everything applied to Krishna becomes transcendental whereas in the mundane sense in the material world there are so many contradictions that cannot be applied to Krishna

The meaning of this verse is: Suta Goswami said, Suta Goswami is responding to Shaunaka Rishi's question. The first verse was the question by Shaunaka Rishi: How did Yudhishthira Maharaj rule? And Suta Goswami is now going to reply: Lord Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the maintainer of the world, became pleased after re-establishing Maharaj Yudhishthira in his own kingdom and after restoring the Kuru dynasty, which had been exhausted by the bamboo fire of anger.

**Key Quote:** "This world is compared to a forest fire Caused by the cohesion of bamboo bushes In the forest"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the analogy of the forest fire caused by bamboo, relating it to the nature of the material world.

So the description is now being given that Krishna was pleased when Yudhishthira was re-established in his own kingdom. It was his rightful claim, but he was denied by Duryodhana and party. So after the battle of Kurukshetra, which had exhausted the Kuru dynasty, the Kuru dynasty had been exhausted by the bamboo fire of anger. So Prabhupada explains in the purport: This world is compared to a forest fire caused by the cohesion of bamboo bushes. In the forest, when there is rubbing of dry bamboo, especially in summer, then the spark ignites the dry wood and the fire of the bamboo bush, and it spreads very quickly. It is typically called a forest fire. It spreads very quickly, and a whole forest can be devoured. All the dry bamboo will be completely devoured by the forest fire. Such a forest fire takes place automatically, for bamboo cohesion occurs without external cause.

Nobody goes and sets fire to a bamboo bush. The bamboo in the forest, it happens without external cause. The natural reason for the fire is the nature of the material world. Similarly, in the material world, the wrath—wrath means anger—anger of those who want to lord it over material nature interacts, and the fire of the wild takes place, exhausting the unwanted population. In the material world, there are so many people who want to lord over material nature or lord over the world. There is competition for supremacy, though the supremacy is actually belonging only to one person, the Supreme Lord Krishna. Krishna is the Lord, Krishna is the master, Krishna is the controller, Krishna is the provider, Krishna is the maintainer, Krishna is the well-wisher. But these foolish people, under the influence of illusion, wrongly think, "I am the lord of all I survey." They think we are independent, they are Lords, they have power, or if they don't have enough power, I will amass power by my strength, by my influence, by my intelligence, by my diplomacy, political diplomacy. I will amass power and then rule over the whole world. This is the ambition of materialistic people.

**Key Quote:** "War exhausts the unwanted population natural calamities in this world are actually due to the fight between such foolish blind materialistic lords"
**Summary:** The speaker connects war and natural calamities to the materialistic desires of people who want to dominate, emphasizing the importance of following God's laws.

But when two such people, both materialistic, foolishly want to lord over, then there is the war that takes place between them. One will fight against the other, and in this way, the war exhausts the unwanted population. Natural calamities in this world are actually due to the fight between such foolish, blind, materialistic lords. And then the war is one natural calamity. Like that, there are so many different natural calamities which exhaust the unwanted population. Such fires or wars take place, and the Lord has nothing to do with them.

**Key Quote:** "Foolish people without understanding the real purpose of this creation they think that there is no god in control this is demonic mentality"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the purpose of creation, contrasting it with the demonic mentality of denying God's control, and highlighting Krishna's desire for people to follow the path of self-realization.

The Lord has given us the laws, and if we abide by the laws, we will be able to understand the purpose of this creation, and we can live here. As long as we live here, we can execute the purpose and prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead. But foolish people, without understanding the real purpose of this creation, they think that there is no God in control. This is demonic mentality. In the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad-Gita, that is described, the demoniac thing: there is no God in control. If at all there is any God, I am that God: ishwaroham ahambhogi siddhoham balavansukhi. This is demonic mentality, blind to reality. This is demonic nature. But Krishna, still, even though there are foolish people and they falsely declared themselves to be the Lords, Krishna nevertheless is in control, because the Lord wants to maintain the creation. He desires the mass of people to follow the right path of self-realization, which enables the living being up to his necessary needs, beings to enter into the kingdom of God. Krishna has given us the right path to follow.

**Key Quote:** "People don't follow the right path of self-realization. They neglect or they violate the laws of God and thereby the Lord has to intervene"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that suffering arises from neglecting religious principles and that Krishna intervenes to re-establish Dharma, emphasizing the importance of following the path of self-realization.

yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata. dharmasya glāni means people don't follow the right path of self-realization. They neglect or they violate the laws of God, and thereby the Lord has to intervene when there is dharmasya glāni, tadātmānamsrujāmyaham. So, when Krishna comes or he sends his representative, paritrāṇāya sādhunāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtāṁ dharmasam sthāpanārthāṁ dharma, he establishes the real religious principles, re-establishes, because that was established in the beginning of creation, and time to time there is deterioration in following, in following the religious principles. Kālā, influence of Kālā. The people desiring to lord over material nature. So the deterioration in practice of Dharma, and the Lord corrects it from time to time because Lord is the well-wisher of everyone. He doesn't want anyone to suffer. Our suffering is only because we don't follow the religious principles. It's the only cause of our suffering in this material. Otherwise, the Lord has provided everything. Everything is re-established. That is our mission here, which is to realize is perfectly controlled by the Lord. We simply have to follow the religious principles, and everything will be alright. And as Prabhupada says here, when people follow the right path

of self-realization as given by God, then the living beings can enter into the kingdom of God. This place is not meant for our permanent residence. No. We are meant to understand we belong to Krishna. We belong to Krishna's personal abode, and we are meant to prepare ourselves to enter into the kingdom of God after following the right path of self-realization. The Lord wants the suffering human beings to come back, welcome back to home, back to him, and he wants to stop the suffering, threefold material pangs. The people who are suffering, He wants to stop their suffering, and he wants these suffering beings, human beings, to come back to his personal abode. So foolish people don't even know about the kingdom of God, and they are misled by atheists and agnostics and materialists who say, "Oh, this is all mythology, kingdom of God, this is all mythology." They have given a term to spoil the faith, to make people more materialistic and demoniac like themselves. So one should not be misled by such propaganda by the godless atheists. The whole plan of creation is made in that way

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of following God's laws to end suffering, explaining that Maya, Krishna's agent, inflicts suffering on those who violate these laws.

which way that people can follow the religious principles as given by God, not self-manufactured religious system. That is another mistake that sometimes people do. "You, I follow my own religious principles." No, you cannot have your own religious principles. It's not going to help you. It's not going to work. Everything is going on according to the laws of God, the laws of God. So you have to follow the laws of God. Everyone has to follow the laws of God. That is the proper way to actually end our suffering. One who does not come to his senses suffers in the material world by pangs inflicted by the illusory energy of the Lord. Anybody who deviates, there is a system that Maya, the agent of Krishna in this material world, she will inflict suffering upon those who violate the laws of God and the laws of God.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Durga Devi and the threefold miseries, emphasizing that these miseries are inflicted upon those who don't follow religious principles, and that the Lord wants his representatives to guide people back to Godhead.

Durga Devi, she has got ten hands, and each of the ten hands she is having one, one weapon, ten weapons she has. She is riding on a lion, and one particular weapon she has got is called trishu, trident. That trishu, you can see one picture, she is killing one demon with a trident. The trident represents, the three prongs of the trident represents the threefold miseries: Adi Daivika Klesha, Adhyatmika Klesha, Adi Bhautika Klesha, miseries due to our own body and mind, miseries due to other living beings, and miseries due to higher forces of nature. So these threefold miseries are inflicted upon those who don't follow the religious principles given by God. So coming to the point, the Lord therefore wants his bona fide representative to rule the world, so that people may follow the exact religious principles and prepare themselves to go back to Godhead under the guidance of God, the representative of Krishna like Yudhishthira Maharaj. So Krishna wanted to establish Yudhishthira Maharaj, so that the citizens can follow under the guidance of Yudhishthira Maharaj, the real religious principles and prepare themselves to go back to Godhead. That is the whole program of this material creation.

**Key Quote:** "This talk was more attractive than the hymns of the Vedas."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse describing the ladies of Hastinapura discussing Krishna's transcendental qualities, which was more attractive than Vedic hymns.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 20th verse of the 10th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. अन्योण्यमि आसीत संजल्पा उत्तमश्लोक चेतुसाम् कव्रवेंद्रपुरस्त्रीनाम् सर्वशुति मनोहरह। The meaning of this verse is: absorbed in the thought of the transcendental qualities of the Lord, who is glorified in select poetry, the ladies on the roofs of all the houses of Hastinapura began to talk of Him. This talk was more attractive than the hymns of the Vedas. This is a very interesting verse in this particular chapter, which describes the departure of Lord Krishna for Dwarka from Hastinapura. So the ladies who were the relatives of the kings and the royalty in the palace of Hastinapura, they went on top of the roof of the houses, and they began to talk of Krishna because they were always absorbed in the thought of the transcendental qualities of the Lord. The word is used: उत्तमश्लोक चेतुसाम् uttamasloka. Krishna's another name is Uttama Shloka, meaning he is glorified in select poetry by great poets, by great devotees. In all the Vedas, he is glorified by select poetry, choicest poetry. So they began to talk of him, of Krishna. And this talk is described here in this verse, was more attractive than the hymns of the Vedas.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Vedas, Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas glorify Hari, and the Bhagavatam exclusively glorifies Krishna.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: In the Bhagavad Gita, it is said that in all the Vedic literatures, the goal is the Personality of Godhead, Krishna. What does Bhagavad Gita say? Vedascha sarvair ahameva vedyo. By all the Vedas am I to be known. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita. And Srila Prabhupada says further, factually the glories of the Lord are depicted in such literature as the Vedas, Ramayana and Mahabharata. This is also mentioned in the scriptures: Vede Ramayane chaiva purane bharate tatha. Aadavantecha madhyecha hari sarvatra giyate. The meaning of this verse is, in the Vedic literature, including the Ramayana, Puranas and Mahabharata, from the very beginning, Aadav, to the end, Antecha, as well as within the middle, Madhyecha, only Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is explained, is glorified. And in the Bhagavatam, they are specifically mentioned in respect to the Supreme Lord. Bhagavata is Krishna Katha. It is exclusive glorification of Krishna from the beginning till the end, throughout the Bhagavatam.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotee is always absorbed in thought of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees are always absorbed in thoughts of Krishna, and their discussions revolve around Krishna.

Therefore, while the ladies on the tops of the houses in the capital of the kings of the kingdom, the Kuru dynasty, were talking about the Lord, their talk was more pleasing than the Vedic hymns. It's generally seen that when ladies gather, they have a tendency to talk amongst themselves about some subject. Now, the subject they choose depends on the level of their consciousness. Anybody, for that matter. Like Srila Prabhupada explains, when businessmen gather in one place, what will their subject matter be? If they are seriously absorbed in business, then their talk will be about business only. Similarly, if scholars of some particular subject, they gather in one place, they will discuss about that subject matter only. They will talk about that subject matter only. So like that, these ladies, they were not just talking about some ordinary topics. No. They were talking about Lord Krishna. Why? Because they were absorbed in thinking about the transcendental qualities of Krishna, which means that they are all devotees of Krishna. So this is one characteristic of a devotee. A devotee is always absorbed in thought of Krishna. So Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, if you really are serious about devotional service, about bhakti, you want to become Krishna's devotee, then you simply think of Krishna always. Think of Krishna always. Conversely, devotees of Krishna always think of Krishna. They are always thinking of Krishna. So therefore, when they talk, the subject matter for their talking is only Krishna and nothing else. So Srila Prabhupada explains that why is it said that the talk of these ladies about Krishna was more attractive than the hymns of the Vedas? So Srila Prabhupada explains,

**Key Quote:** "The language is immaterial, but the subject matter is important."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that anything sung in praise of the Lord is Shruti Mantra, and the subject matter is more important than the language, citing examples of Narottam Dasa Thakur and Purandara Dasa.

anything sung in the praise of the Lord is Shruti Mantra. Shruti means the Vedas, the original Vedas. There are songs of Thakur Narottam Dasa, one of the Acharyas in the Gaudiya Sampradaya, composed in simple Bengali language. Narottam Dasa Thakur is a great Acharya. He was a contemporary of Srila Jeeva Goswami, who was one of the chief disciples of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So he learnt this Bhagavatam under Srila Jeeva Goswami, and then he has written so many songs in simple Bengali language, explaining the same subject matter, so that it is easily understandable by common people. He was preaching in Bengal, so it is written in Bengali language. Now, another Acharya, Thakur Vishwanath Chakravarthi, who is a very learned Acharya of the same Sampradaya, Vishwanath Chakravarthi Thakur has approved the songs by Thakur Narottam Dasa to be as good as Vedic mantras, even though they are written in simple Bengali language, but the subject matter is simply describing Krishna. So therefore they are as good as Vedic mantras. And Prabhupada says, this is so because of the subject matter. The language is immaterial, but the subject matter is important. Of course, the original Vedas are always in Sanskrit language, but even if something is written in simple Bengali, or for that matter in Karnataka, Purandara Dasa has written lakhs and lakhs of songs in simple Kannada language, but the subject matter is the subject matter of Krishna, the subject matter of the Vedas. So the subject matter is important,

**Key Quote:** "By absorbing their mind in thoughts and actions of the Supreme Lord, they develop the consciousness of Vedic wisdom by the grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by absorbing their minds in Krishna, the ladies develop Vedic wisdom through Krishna's grace, and Krishna enlightens devotees from within.

the language is immaterial. So it is said here, the ladies who are all absorbed in the thought and actions of the Lord, develop the consciousness of Vedic wisdom by the grace of the Lord. Now in the next few verses, there will be description of what were they, what was their subject of discussion? What were they talking? So it's all full of Vedic wisdom. Their talk is full of Vedic wisdom. So Srila Prabhupada explains, therefore, although such ladies might not have been very learned scholars in Sanskrit or otherwise, these ladies, they are just householders. They are not particularly meant to study the Vedas, go to Gurukul, in the Vedic culture at least. But that does not mean they are totally ignorant about Krishna, or they are totally ignorant about the Vedic conclusions. No. By absorbing their mind in thoughts and actions of the Supreme Lord, they develop the consciousness of Vedic wisdom. How? By the grace of the Supreme Lord Krishna. And how are they able to get that grace of the Supreme Lord? Because Krishna is seated on the heart of every one of us, every living being. So if somebody is absorbed in the thought of Krishna, Krishna enlightens such a devotee from within. TESHAM SATATA YUKTANAM BHAJATAM PRITI PURVAKAM DADAMI BUDDHI YOGAM TAM YENAMA MUPAYANTITE TESHAM EVANUKAM PARTHAM AHAM AGNYANAJAM TAMAHA NASHAYAMI ATMABHAVASTO GYANADIPENABHASVATAM Krishna enlightens from within the heart of his devotees. Therefore, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, the most confidential instruction, become my devotee, then Krishna will enlighten. There is no need of specifically attempting to study the Vedas, which are very difficult, because the Vedic language is not easy. Even for Sanskrit scholars, Vedic language is not easily understood in the proper perspective. So therefore, Krishna says, you simply become my devotee. Think of me. Discuss about me. And then I will enlighten you from within your heart. All the Vedic conclusions will be revealed by Krishna in the heart of the devotee.

**Key Quote:** "The discussions or the descriptions in the Puranas, Itihasas, about the personal feature of the Lord are more attractive and pleasing to hear than the descriptions in the Upanishads."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why the ladies' talks were more attractive than Vedic hymns, because the Puranas describe the personal feature of the Lord in detail, which is more attractive than the impersonal descriptions in the Upanishads.

Whatever they spoke, these ladies of Hastinapura, was more attractive than the Vedic hymns. Why? Why is it like that? Prabhupada says, the Vedic hymns in the Upanishads are sometimes indirectly directed to the Supreme Lord. The Upanishads are actually the philosophical portions of the Vedas which describe the Absolute Truth. And the Absolute Truth is described both impersonal and personal. So the impersonal descriptions are very prominent in the Upanishads portions of the Vedas. Whereas, the personal aspect of the Absolute Truth, that is the Personality of Godhead, Krishna, Rama, Narsimha, Varaha, all the incarnations are more nicely described in detail in the Puranas, Itihasas, like Ramayana, entirely about Lord Rama. Mahabharata, about Krishna and many other incarnations. Bhagavatam, fully about Krishna and his incarnations. So the Puranas are describing the personal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, the discussions or the descriptions in the Puranas, Itihasas, about the personal feature of the Lord are more attractive and pleasing to hear than the descriptions in the Upanishads. Therefore, it is said the ladies' talks were more attractive than the Vedic hymns.

**Key Quote:** "instead of trying to study the Vedas and then try to understand what is the Absolute Truth, one should simply engage in devotional service by which automatically one becomes enlightened in the Vedic wisdom"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that engaging in devotional service, such as chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa or worshipping Kṛṣṇa, leads to enlightenment and purification, ultimately reconnecting one with Kṛṣṇa.

of the tenth chapter of the first canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. savai-kilāyaṁ puruṣa-pūrātaṇo ya eka āsīd aviśeṣa ātmani agre guṇebhyo jagad ātmanīśvare nimīlita ātman nishi-sūpta-śaktiṣu. The meaning of this verse is, they said, the ladies of Sīnāpura who are standing on top of the palace, "Here he is, the original personality of Godhead as we definitely remember him. He alone existed before the manifested creation of the modes of nature, and in him only, because he is the Supreme Lord, all living beings merge as if sleeping at night, their energy is suspended." The ladies of the royal palace of Sīnāpura, they are talking amongst themselves about Kṛṣṇa, and the level of their knowledge is so very advanced that Bhāgavatam presents this as the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, their talks. That is because, as was explained earlier, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, simply because the devotee is engaged in devotional service, which is as simple as chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, worshipping Kṛṣṇa, or just having darshan of Kṛṣṇa's deity, one becomes enlightened from within by the grace of the Supreme Lord who is seated in everyone's heart as Paramātmā. So, these ladies, they are able to discuss at this level, advanced level of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, simply because they are enlightened from within by Kṛṣṇa Himself. So, therefore, it is said, instead of trying to study the Vedas and then try to understand what is the Absolute Truth, one should simply engage in devotional service, by which automatically one becomes enlightened in the Vedic wisdom, and one also becomes purified in the heart of all material contamination, one makes advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and ultimately one becomes reconnected with Kṛṣṇa in their original relationship with Kṛṣṇa. So, bhakti is the only way to achieve ultimate perfection in our self-realization, in our spiritual development.

**Key Quote:** "at the end of Brahma's life all the planets and universe are completely destroyed and in both the periods the material energy called the Mahat Tattva and the marginal energy called the Jeeva Tattva merge in the person of the Supreme Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the cyclical nature of creation, maintenance, and destruction in the material world, contrasting it with the eternal existence of the spiritual world, Krishna's personal abode.

So, the magnetism has definitely been learnt from my Angara, which is known as отсurgency, because through non-figure rests and water fish GMT, whoever is clothed in water in the, and when it is not visible, it's called unmanifested. So, this manifested cosmic manifestation, cosmos, has two kinds of dissolution, two kinds of destruction. At the end of Brahma's day, which is four billion three hundred and twenty million years, the quanda, our calculation, that is just the day of Brahma. When Brahma, the one particular, the Lord of one particular universe goes to sleep, there is one annihilation, it's called a partial destruction. At the end of Brahma's life, which takes place at the end of Brahma's 100 years, Brahma's 100 years, and what is that calculation? According to our calculation, 8 billion 640 million years into 30 into 12 into 100, that comes to some 311 trillion years, there is complete annihilation of the entire universe, complete annihilation. As I said, Brahma's end of the day, only partial destruction of the middle and lower planetary systems. At the end of Brahma's life, all the planets and universe are completely destroyed. And in both the periods, the material energy called the Mahat Tattva and the marginal energy called the Jeeva Tattva merge in the person of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is present as Garbhodakashai Vishnu or Padmanabha Vishnu. In him, both the material energy and the living entities actually rest during the periods when there is dissolution of this universe. The living beings remain asleep within the body of the Lord until there is another creation of the material world, and that is the way of the creation, maintenance, and annihilation of the material manifestation. So, this material world means there is creation, maintenance, destruction, creation, maintenance, destruction. This cyclically goes on perpetually. And what about the spiritual world, Krishna's personal abode, Vaikunthaloka, Goloka Vrindavana? Never destroyed, never created.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord existed before the creation and exists in various eternal forms, while our material forms are temporary and subject to destruction.

eternally existing. So, throughout the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is telling, "There is another world apart from this world you are living in. In that world, there is no destruction." So, Krishna is telling, "Come to that world." That is Krishna's personal abode. Krishna says, "Come to that world," he is inviting all of us. So, Sri La Pravapa explains further, "The material creation is directed by the interaction of the three modes of material nature set in action by the Lord, and therefore it is said here that the Lord existed before the modes of material nature was set in motion." So, before this creation, Lord existed as Krishna in his various forms. All the forms, Lord Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, Vraha, Narayana, Vishnu, they always exist in that particular eternal form, whereas we, we have got a form now and after that creation, but this form is not going to last, it is going to be destroyed end of this life or in the end of the universe, at the end of this manifestation when the dissolution takes place, this will be destroyed. So, ahh, it is competency.

#### Mahavishnu, creation of universes, Brahma's lifespan, God's greatness

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Mahavishnu breathes out universes in very, very, very tiny seed-like form, but each of them develops into huge, gigantic universe with millions of planets."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Mahavishnu lying on the causal ocean, breathing out universes in seed form, and explains the vast timescale of Brahma's lifespan in relation to Mahavishnu's breathing cycle.

Informed in the Shruti Mantra, in the Vedas, original Vedas, that only Vishnu, the Supreme Lord, existed before the creation and there was no Brahma, no Shiva, no demigods. Vishnu means the Mahavishnu who is lying on the causal ocean. There is one causal ocean, Karana Jala. And there, one form of Vishnu, the first form of Vishnu, Mahavishnu, he is lying there and he is breathing and by his breathing, the universes are coming out of his body in the form of seeds. And these seed-like universes, very, very tiny, they develop gradually into huge universe. And within that universe, there will be universe. There will be innumerable planets in each and every universe. Now, how do they develop? Prabhupada gives a very nice example. Just like a very, very, very small banyan seed, seed of a banyan tree, very tiny, it's like a pinhead, it's very, very small. That, when planted in a fertile ground, it will develop into huge universe. A huge banyan tree that can spread over hundreds of square kilometers. That tiny seed. So, like that, Mahavishnu breathes out universes in very, very, very tiny seed-like form. But each of them develops into huge, gigantic universe with millions of planets. Each planet, millions of living entities. So, this Mahavishnu is described in the Brahma Samhita as a plenary portion of Krishna. In the Brahma Samhita it is said, "Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the original personality of Godhead, Govinda, whose plenary portion is Mahavishnu. All the Brahmas, the heads of the universes, live only for the period of his exhaling after universes are generated from the pores of his transcendental body." So, Krishna expands as Mahavishnu. That Mahavishnu breathes out universes in seed-like form. And they'll remain only as long as, after his breathing out, for some time, he is not inhaling. So, he, after he exhales, little time, then he inhales. So, that tiny duration between his exhalation and inhalation, that is the duration of the life of Brahma. Jeevan tiloma vilaja jagadanda natha. That is lifetime of Brahma. For us, how long is that period? 311 trillion years. The lifespan of Brahma, according to our calculation. So, the interval between the exhalation, outgoing breath of Mahavishnu, and the inhaling, the incoming breath, is 311 trillion years. This is not even the complete breathing cycle of Mahavishnu. 311 trillion years. It is the intervening time between his exhalation and inhalation.

**Key Quote:** "an authoritative source is the only means of knowing about transcendental subject matter definitely. There is no other alternative."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that Krishna is the original person, that knowledge of transcendental subjects comes from authoritative sources, and that our true identity is spiritual, discoverable through devotional service.

So, try to understand how great is God. Just this alone can help you understand. So, that Krishna, what the ladies are telling, is actually the Mahavishnu. Krishna is the original person. He expands into different incarnations, different forms of incarnations, and they are all Him only. So, Mahavishnu, who is actually the origin of this universe, who breathes in and breathes out, creation and annihilation takes place. So, that Mahavishnu is none other than Krishna only. Therefore, they are saying, "Here is the original personality of Godhead. He alone existed before the manifested creation of the modes of nature." Therefore, they are saying that. The ladies talking about this Vedic truth must have heard it from authoritative source. Otherwise, how can they exactly describe this accurately? So, an authoritative source is the only means of knowing about transcendental subject matter definitely. There is no other alternative. Who can ever figure out this? That how is this creation taking place? The way it is described here, how can somebody figure out? Except by hearing from the proper authority or proper source. So, therefore, the scriptures say, hear from the Vedas. Hear from the original source, from Krishna, from the Acharyas, who receive this knowledge from Krishna in parampara. There is no other way of knowing this. Now, the merging of the living entities in the body of Mahavishnu or Garbhodakshaya Vishnu, does not mean the living being is the only being. Does not mean the living being is the only being. The living being as spirit soul is eternally existent. But the body is annihilated. So, the real identity of the living being is spiritual. And that is, we are ultimately devotees of Krishna. And to discover or awaken or come to know about our real identity, we have to engage in devotional service. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.10.22) and explains its meaning, focusing on Krishna's role in creation and the placement of living entities under material nature's guidance.

In this session we will be discussing from the 22nd verse of the 10th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a continuation of the talk of the ladies of Hastinapura about Krishna. Sa eva bhuyo nija virya choditam Svajivamayam prakritim sisrikshatim Anama roopatmani roopanamani Viditsamano anusasara shastrakrit. The meaning of this verse is: The personality of Godhead, again desiring to give names and forms to his parts and parcels, the living entities, place them under the guidance of material nature. By his own potency, material nature is empowered to recreate. So in the talk they are describing how this creation takes place by the intervention of

**Key Quote:** "We cannot be separated from the Lord completely. The relationship or the link in terms of relationship always exists eternally."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the inseparable and eternal relationship between living entities and Krishna, contrasting it with temporary material relationships.

Hmm. So in the Purport, Shila Prabhupada explains, "The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord." Each one of us, every living being is a part and parcel. Part means, you can understand, a very, very tiny portion of the Lord, supreme whole. Parcel means inseparable part. Inseparable part. We cannot be separated from the Lord completely. The relationship or the link in terms of relationship always exists eternally. Unlike the relationships in this world, which are based on the body, when the body is annihilated there is no meaning to the relationship at all. Whereas, our relationship with Krishna is spirit soul to the supreme spirit. And since the spirit soul is eternal, supreme spirit Krishna is eternal. If then there is no meaning to the relationship. Hegopgga abhyasa maran incredible. Yu.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is our supreme father that he describes in the Bhagavad-gita aham bija pradapita so he has placed us under this material energy for our rectification of our rebellious attitude"
**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes between eternally liberated (Nithya Mukta) and eternally conditioned (Nithya Baddha) souls, explaining that conditioned souls are placed in the material world to rectify their rebellious attitude towards Krishna.

two varieties: Nithya Mukta and Nithya Baddha. Nithya Mukta are eternally liberated souls. Nithya Mukta, eternally liberated, and they are eternally engaged in reciprocation of transcendental loving service with the Lord in his eternal abode beyond the manifested mundane creation, beyond this material world, which is sometimes manifest, sometimes unmanifest, sometimes existing as this world after the creation, and after dissolution it doesn't exist as this world, it will be in a dormant state. Whereas Krishna's abode is eternally existing and there there are eternally liberated souls engaged in devotional service, in loving devotional service and in the spiritual service of the Lord. And so this reciprocation with Krishna, but the Nithya Baddha or eternally conditioned souls are entrusted to his external energy, Maya. All of us in this material world, we are called Nithya Baddha, eternally conditioned, and we are placed in the Material Energy why? For rectification of their rebellious attitude toward the Supreme Father. Krishna is our supreme father, that he describes in the Bhagavad-Gita, aham bija pradapita. So he has placed us under this material energy for our rectification of our rebellious attitude.

**Key Quote:** "All of us in this material world are eternally forgetful of the relation with the lord as parts and parcels"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the forgetfulness of conditioned souls regarding their relationship with Krishna, their bewilderment by Maya, and their futile attempts to find lasting happiness in the material world.

What is this rebellious attitude that is described by Prabhupada as nitya badhas? That is, all of us in this material world are eternally forgetful of the relation with the Lord as parts and parcels. Any of the only the souls of this world, you ask, do you remember Krishna? No, nobody remembers Krishna. They forget who is who they are, they forget who is Krishna, they forget definitely eternal relationship with Krishna. This is the condition, our condition is like this: forgetfulness of Krishna, forgetfulness of our eternal relationship. You and we are bewildered by the illusory energy, Maya. Maya means this illusory energy and we think that we are product of this material energy or matter. We are products of matter. We think in terms of this body. This body is made up of matter. We think in terms of this body, material body only, and that way we are busy making plans in this material world for becoming happy. In this spiritual condition we are naturally always happy in relationship with Krishna, but in the material world we are not always happy. We have to seek happiness and for seeking happiness we have to make so many plans. It is not natural for us to be always happy, no, not in the material.

**Key Quote:** "At the end of the millennium all the living entities merge into my nature and again when the time of creation is ripe I begin creation by the agency of my external energy"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the cyclical nature of creation, maintenance, and destruction, referencing the Bhagavad Gita and emphasizing the role of Krishna's external energy.

Now in forgetfulness, when we are making plans to become happy thinking we are products of matter, all our plans are completely destroyed at the end of a certain period. That is mentioned in the previous words, know that there is always two kinds of destruction, end of Brahma's day, end of Brahma's life. So that is explained in the Bhagavad Gita in a brief manner. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, "At the end of the millennium all the living entities merge into my nature and again when the time of creation is ripe I begin creation by the agency of my external energy." So as I explained in a previous session, creation, maintenance, destruction is going on. So after creation the living entities are getting bodies and after dissolution they remain unmanifest without a material body in the body of Mahavishnu or the body of Garbhodakshaya Vishnu for some time, for a length of time without a body, without a material body. So periodically this happens again and again. The living entities are created and they merge into Krishna's nature at the end of Brahma's day or Brahma's life. The word bhuvaya used in this words indicates again and again, that is to say the process of creation, maintenance and annihilation is going on perpetually by the external energy of the Lord, by this material energy.

Krishna is the cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction. The living entities who are constitutionally the parts and parts of the Lord are forgetful of the sweet relationship with Krishna and they are given a chance to get rid of the clutches of this material and usury energy. Why? Krishna creates to give us a chance to become free from this cycle of birth and death, from the clutches of maya.

of Krishna. What has Krishna done? He has given us the revealed scriptures, the vedic literature. So vedic literatures are guiding directions for the conditioned souls so that they can become free from the repetition of birth and death, they can become free from this material body. That's the purpose of this creation and that is explained in the vedic literature and in the Bhagavad-Gita. This is all explained in very brief in the Bhagavad-Gita. It is given in great detail. Bhagavad-Gita, what does Krishna say? The created world and the material energy are under my control. Again and again this material world is created and this is done through the agency of the external energy. Krishna is not directly involved but under his control material energy is again and again creating, maintaining and destroying. Actually we don't have any material name or form as spirit soul in our original position in our relationship with Krishna, but just because we want to enjoy materially therefore to satisfy that desire for material enjoyment there is this arrangement that we are given a material body, a material form, material name, material qualities simply for the sake of satisfying our desire for material enjoyment, but side by side in the human form of life we are given a chance to understand what is our revealed what is our real position.

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes materialistic people who are absorbed in false names and forms, emphasizing the importance of realizing one's spiritual identity to escape the cycle of birth and death.

they are busy with materialism and they always are remaining forgetful of Krishna, about their own self, real self. They perpetually keep taking birth, they keep dying again and again and again. So people who are materialistic, Prabhupada describes here, are mad after false name and form. This material body, there is a material form and the corresponding material name and the different qualities and characteristics. Under certain conditions this form of the body is thought of as real, factual, and bewildered by the misuse of the material energy people are completely absorbed just in this material body. It's such a waste of time and it is loss of a valuable opportunity to realize who we actually are because until we realize we are spirit soul, we have a spiritual form, we have a spiritual identity, we are spiritually eternally connected with Krishna, until then we cannot get out of this perpetual cycle of birth and death.

in which there is always suffering. Even though there is some so-called happiness, with great endeavor we may get some happiness, but real happiness is spiritual, it's not material. The scriptures supply the clue for understanding our real position, but people are reluctant to take the lessons from the scriptures. So this is the reason why we are living in this material world. So Bhagavad Gita says, for example, Krishna has presented the Bhagavad Gita, spoken the Bhagavad Gita. It says that one should actually understand one's identity as spirit soul and work for realizing this position as spirit soul and thereby become enlightened in Krishna's consciousness and get out of this material existence to live eternal life full of bliss and

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.10.23) and explains that the ladies of Hastinapura, though not highly educated, are discussing Krishna, emphasizing the potential for awakening Krishna consciousness in everyone.

In this session we will be discussing from the 23rd verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Savaayam Yat Padam Atra Surayo Jitendriya Nirjitam Atarishvanaha Pashyanti Bhakti Utkalitat Amalatmana Nanvesha Sattvam Parimastum Arhati. The meaning of this verse is: Here is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead whose transcendental form is experienced by the great devotees who are completely cleansed of material consciousness by dint of rigid devotional service and full control of life and the senses, and that is the only way to purify existence. These are words spoken by the ladies of Hastinapura. They are discussing amongst themselves about the personality of Godhead Krishna. This is when Krishna is about to leave Hastinapura for travelling back to Dwaraka. So these ladies, they are not any great women. They are not that great, they are not very well educated. See, they have absolutely no knowledge of Krishna. They have no wisdom in Krishna and they have no knowledge of the great Godhead Krishna. Can't they even understand or understand what Krishna is about? They are not aware of him, they are aware of the great Godhead Krishna who is about to leave Hastinapura. So, what is Krishna? What is Krishna's personality? What is the nature of Krishna? What is Krishna's identity, what does he mean by that? What is Krishna's personality?

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the purpose of Srimad Bhagavatam as a means to awaken Krishna consciousness, emphasizing its accessibility through translations and commentaries.

And of course, that hearing also results in purification of the heart in awakening their dormant Krishna consciousness, which is natural for everyone, every living being, every person. It is natural. So we can also adopt the same method of awakening our own Krishna consciousness. It is with this perspective that Srimad Bhagavatam has been spoken by Shukadeva Goswami, has been recorded by Srila Vyasadeva, has been translated and commented by all the Acharyas. And it is with this purpose only Srila Vyasadeva has been recorded. And the same way that absolute truth, Insatana Bhagavad explains to us in very simple easily understandable language, the Srimad Bhagavatam, which is in Sanskrit language, he is giving us in simple English. So they are describing who can actually experience the transcendental form of Krishna. Krishna, the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the sentirable energy that accelerates death and prosperity of people.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how to perceive Krishna, emphasizing the need for cleansing material consciousness through devotional service and sense control, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

a transcendental person, is the transcendental person and that form, transcendental form cannot be seen with ordinary eyes. Krishna is seated in our heart but we look into our heart we cannot see Krishna in our present condition. So how can we see Krishna? That is possible if we cleanse our material consciousness by two things mentioned here. We perform rigid devotional service and we are able to gain full control of life and the senses. Only then we can actually see Krishna within our own eyes. We can see Krishna within our own heart and not only that they are telling that this method of cleansing the heart is the only way to purify our existence, present state of existence, material existence. The only way. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport that it is stated in the Bhagavad Gita that the Lord can be known in his real nature by dint of pure devotional service only. Bhaktiamam abhijanati yavanyas chasmi tatvatah. Krishna says in the 18th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita Bhaktia only by dint of pure devotional service. We can know Krishna. Bhaktiamam abhijanati. We can know him.

**Summary:** The speaker provides practical examples of daily devotional activities like chanting, worship, and hearing Krishna's glories, explaining how these practices purify the mind from material contamination accumulated over lifetimes.

In the Bhagavad Gita also the same thing is explained. By rigid devotional service. Practice. Constant practice. Every day we have to chant and hear Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Every day. Every day we have to worship Krishna. Every day we have to take food offered to Krishna as prasadam. Every day we have to sing Krishna's glories. We have to hear the Srimad Bhagavatam or read the Bhagavatam or recollect the pastimes of Krishna which we may have heard earlier. This is required every day. Srimad Bhagavatam sevaya. Nitya means every day. Regularly. Constantly. Always. This way the mind can become purified of all material dust. This material dust we have accumulated over long association with material nature in past so many millions of years, of lifetimes. We have been around in this material world changing bodies again and again and again and again and again. This is called repetition of birth and death. Samsara. We perform some activities in this life, and those activities result in some reactions, good or bad.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material activities with devotional service, highlighting that only through contact with a pure devotee and acceptance of devotional service can one break free from the cycle of birth and death, emphasizing the human form's potential for understanding one's relationship with Krishna.

And then to undergo those reactions we get another body and in the next life again we perform some more material activities and this repeats till we come in contact with a pure devotee of Krishna like Srila Prabhupada and after that we accept the process of rigid devotional self. This is the service. Until then our material existence continues life after life after life after life after life. You can see everywhere around you what are people engaged in. They are simply engaged in material activities whether good or bad. So they have no chance of purifying their body, mind. So they remain in ignorance, darkness of ignorance. And only in the human form of life do we have the developed intelligence to understand this. Who am I? Who is Krishna? What is my relationship with Krishna? What am I entitled to? As spirit soul I am entitled to eternal happiness in association with Krishna. That is explained by Srila Prabhupada. So Srila Prabhupada explains further in this purport. Jita Indriya means one who has full control over the senses. Jita Indriya. One who has conquered his senses. Normally we are dictated by our senses. Our senses demand and we try to fulfill those demands.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of 'Jita Indriya' (sense control) and contrasts it with 'Ajita Indriya' (uncontrolled senses), arguing that true happiness comes from engaging the senses in devotional service rather than suppressing them, using the example of Vishwamitra Muni to illustrate the failure of artificial sense control methods.

With the hope that I will be able to fulfill those demands, I will become happy if I satisfy my senses. This is ignorance actually. The reality is that these senses if they are controlled and engaged in devotional service only then can we become really happy, experience real happiness. If we are Jita Indriya. Those who are simply trying to satisfy the demands of the senses they are called Ajita Indriya. Ajita Indriya. Most people they are just having these uncontrolled senses and their life is only simply satisfying the demands of the senses all the time, all the time. And the center of all these senses is the mind so it's the mind which is driving the senses and the senses are driving our organs of action and is simply engaged in different activities with the single aim of satisfying the senses and the mind with a hope that we can become happy but it is explained here that sense control is not possible by stopping all activities of the senses and it is even explained here for Srila Prabhupada the artificial means of the yogic processes to make the senses inactive has proved to be abject failure trying to stop the senses by even the hatha yoga or the ashtanga yoga process is not a guaranteed method of controlling the senses the example is given of Vishwamitra Muni a very famous example he controlled his senses by yogic trance but when he happened to meet Menaka an absurd trauma he became a victim of sex and artificial way of controlling the senses failed what is this artificial way you try to suppress the senses we say no no no no to demands of the senses but the devotee simply engages all the senses and that is exactly what is bhakti rishikeshya sevannam bhakti ruchyate engage the senses to fulfill himself the eyes and seeing the beautiful form of Krishna, engage the tongue in tasting wonderful Krishna Prasadam, engage the ears in hearing nice Krishna Katha or nice Krishna Bhajans, like that and your senses automatically become controlled and when they are purified you can see Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "That's Krishna's mission and that's the mission of all Krishna's devotees also so it is Krishna only who is the supreme personality of God it who creates maintains and unleads the material world and he remains unaffected"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining Krishna's role as the creator, maintainer, and destroyer, emphasizing his transcendental nature and the mission to liberate conditioned souls.

In this session we will be discussing from the 24th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Savaayam Sakhi Anugeeta Sakkatho Vedeshu Guhyejucha Guhyavadibhihi Ya Eka Eesho Jagad Atma Leelaya Srijati Avati Atti Natatra Sajjate. The meaning of this verse is: O dear friends, here is that very personality of Godhead whose attractive and confidential pastimes are described in the confidential parts of Vedic literature by his great devotees. It is he only who creates, maintains, and annihilates the material world and yet remains unaffected. These are words spoken by the ladies of Ashthinapura. They know the transcendental nature of Krishna's personality. They are not mistaking him to be another ordinary King. Even though he is playing the role of the King of Dwaraka, it is actually his eternal Leela in the spiritual world which he is displaying in the material world to attract us, the conditioned souls who are trapped here. He wants us to get out of this material existence, put an end to all our suffering. That's Krishna's mission and that's the mission of all Krishna's devotees also. So it is Krishna only, who is the supreme personality of Godhead, who creates, maintains, and unleashes the material world, and he remains unaffected. That cannot be said of the Devatas or anybody else who is engaged in different activities in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "So if you really want to hear the most attractive personal feature of the absolute truth then you have to hear the most confidential part of the Vedic literature which describes those confidentialities of the Vedas and the personal features of the Vedas confidential pastimes and they are described only by great devotees they discard only by great devotees"
**Summary:** This segment discusses the different aspects of the Vedas, contrasting the impersonal Brahman feature with the personal Bhagavan feature, and highlighting that the most confidential pastimes of Krishna are revealed by great devotees.

You can see that in the material world everyone else becomes bound up by their material actions, whereas Krishna remains completely transcendental under all circumstances. And here it's also said that Krishna's pastimes are confidential, confidential parts of the Vedic literature by his great devotees. So ordinarily the Vedas describe the absolute truth in terms of the impersonal feature and the localized feature, the Brahman feature and the Paramahatma feature. The descriptions of the Bhagawan feature, the personal feature, is very rarely found in the original Vedas. It is there in the original Vedas, but it is not so much described. The bulk of the Vedas consists of the descriptions of the interactions to the three gunas, trai guna vishaya Veda, and the conclusion of the Vedas given as Vedanta philosophy describes mostly the impersonal feature or the Brahman feature of the absolute truth. So if you really want to hear the most attractive personal feature of the absolute truth, Krishna Murti, Krishna Rama, Narsimha, Brahma, Narayana, all of these activities of the personality of Godhead in his various incarnations, and especially his activities in his form, original form as Krishna, then you have to hear the most confidential part of the Vedic literature which describes those confidentialities of the Vedas and the personal features of the Vedas, confidential pastimes, and they are described only by great devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Srimad Bhagavatam as a special literature containing confidential knowledge of Krishna's activities, narrated by Sukhadeva Goswami.

They are described only by great devotees. So in the purport from the process as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, all the Vedic literature is glorified greatness of Lord Sri Krishna, her Esvrat Rageet a, everywhere in all the Vedic literature they are simply glorifying the greatness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. Here it is confirmed in the Bhagavatam also, the Vedas are expanded by many branches and sub-branches by great devotees and empowered incarnations of the Lord like Vyasa, Narada, Sukhadeva Goswami, the Kumaras, Kapila, Prahlada, Janaka, Bali, and Yamaraj. All of these personalities are Mahajanas, Mahatmas, pure devotees, great personalities, but in the Srimad Bhagavatam especially the confidential parts of his activities are described by the confidential devotee Sukhadeva Goswami. So Bhagavatam is special literature. There are so many Vedic literatures, but among all of them, Nigamakalpatarorgalitamphalam, the most confidential pastimes described in the Bhagavatam are very special and they are described by confidential devotee Sukhadeva Goswami. In the Vedanta sutras or the Upanishads there is only a hint of the confidential parts of his pastimes.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna the personality of Godhead is completely a spiritual personality no tinge of any materiality in his personality he looks like an ordinary person but he is not an ordinary person"
**Summary:** This segment explains the transcendental nature of Krishna, emphasizing that he is a completely spiritual personality, and that his activities (Leela) may appear ordinary but are actually expressions of divine love.

In such Vedic literatures as the Upanishads, the Lord has explained to us that the Lord has expressively been distinguished from the mundane conception of his existence. The Upanishads are describing the transcendental nature of the absolute truth completely separated from the material nature. In the Bhagavad Gita, in the second chapter elaborately it is explained in the second chapter that the soul is not, the soul itself is non-material, the spirit, and so is Krishna. The personality of Godhead is completely a spiritual personality, no tinge of any materiality in his personality. He looks like an ordinary person, but he is not an ordinary person. He looks like a limited person, but he is unlimited personality. He looks like he is incapable when he's chastised by mother Yashoda and he becomes afraid of her punishment. It appears like if a child is afraid of the mother then that child is not any great personality, but Krishna is performing his Leela in his activities in relationship of love with mother Yashoda. This we can understand if we hear the Bhagavatam from Sukhadeva Goswami or from a representative of Sukhadeva Goswami like Srila Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is fully present in that sound Krishna so when you say Krishna Krishna appears in the form the sound and he purifies you if you touch him by your consciousness your consciousness becomes completely surcharged with devotion"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's spiritual qualities, highlighting that his name is non-different from him and that chanting it purifies one's consciousness, leading to attraction to Krishna.

Or from a representative of Sukhadeva Goswami like Srila Prabhupada. They know the confidential nature of such activities of Krishna. So the nature of Krishna's personality has to be understood carefully from the right source. So further Srila Prabhupada says, his identity being fully spiritual, his form, name, quality, and paraphernalia have been elaborately distinguished from matter. They are not material. This form is not material. Our form is completely material. His name is not a material name. That means there are no material qualities when we designate this object as a table. It is entitled actually, is nominated as the author of a census, which means it has been talked about in materialist literature all the way to the recent decades when it is designation of the object itself, it is not the object itself. The name table or the sound table is not the object table, whereas Krishna, when you say Krishna, it's not a name which is indicating Krishna. The name Krishna is Krishna, is the person Krishna. So Krishna is fully present in that sound Krishna. So when you say Krishna, Krishna appears in the form, the sound, and he purifies you. If you touch him by your consciousness, your consciousness becomes completely surcharged with devotion, with bhakti, with love for Krishna. So that is name of Krishna, Krishna namah. His qualities, all his qualities are spiritual, transcendental. That means if Krishna is attractive, that attractive feature of his personality is a transcendental feature. That means once we become attracted to Krishna, nothing else in this material world will be attractive to us. All other attractions will pale into insignificance.

**Key Quote:** "This verse explains krishna is all attractive means he attracts everyone and how does he do so by his unlimited attractive qualities he is a reservoir of all wonderful qualities and each person is attracted by one particular quality of krishna"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by discussing the all-attractive nature of Krishna, explaining that he possesses unlimited qualities that attract different individuals, and that uncovering one's heart leads to attraction to Krishna through bhakti.

When we get attracted by Krishna. This is very nicely explained by Sri Chaitanya Maha Prabhu in the 61 meanings of the Atmarama verse of the Bhagavatam. There is one verse in the Bhagavatam which describes the all attractive feature of Krishna's personality. This verse explains Krishna is all attractive, means he attracts everyone, and how does he do so? By his unlimited attractive qualities. He is a reservoir of all wonderful qualities and each person is attracted by one particular quality of Krishna because that is their nature. Somebody is attracted by Krishna's beauty, somebody is attracted by Krishna's wealth, somebody is attracted by Krishna's kindness, somebody is attracted by Krishna's love. Of course love is a general thing, everybody is attracted by Krishna's love because everyone has a loving relationship with Krishna, but different qualities of Krishna attract different persons and how many qualities that Krishna possess? Unlimited qualities. The sum total of all qualities which are possessed by anybody or all the people, those are the reservoir of qualities in Krishna. All good qualities Krishna possesses and he attracts. So right now our condition is that we are covered, so we are unable to experience that attraction of Krishna. So when we uncover our heart immediately we get attracted to Krishna. That is actually the process of bhakti. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna incarnates in every yuga to show his mercy towards the faithful devotees, to protect them and to destroy all these animal-like kings and administrators."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam (1.10.25) and explains that Krishna incarnates in every yuga to protect devotees and destroy evil, attracting conditioned souls back to Godhead.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 25th verse of the 10th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam: Yadahi Adharmena Tamodhiyo Nripa Jeevanti Tatreshahi Satvatah Kila Dhatte Bhagam Satyam Ritam Dayam Yasho Bhavaya Rupani Dadhat Yuge Yuge. The meaning of this verse is: Whenever there are kings and administrators living like animals in the lowest modes of existence, the Lord in his transcendental form manifests his supreme power, the truth positive, shows special mercy to the faithful, performs wonderful activities, and manifests various transcendental forms as is necessary in different periods and ages. So this is the understanding of the pure devotees, that Krishna incarnates in every yuga to show his mercy towards the faithful devotees, to protect them, and to destroy all these animal-like kings and administrators in the lowest modes of existence, and to also, most importantly, perform his wonderful activities to attract the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "This world we think it belongs to us but actually it belongs to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that everything belongs to Krishna and we are entitled to only what we need to execute our prescribed duties, emphasizing the concept of divine ownership.

To go back to his personal abode with him, live with him eternally, a life of bliss and knowledge and eternal life. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, as mentioned above, the cosmic creation is the property of the Supreme Lord. This world, we think it belongs to us, but actually it belongs to Krishna. This is the basic philosophy of the Isha Upanishad. The first to punish it among all the punishments, Isha Upanishad, there it is explained, every one of us is a part of the Supreme Lord, and we are all part of the Supreme Lord. Everything is the property of the Supreme being: Isha vasya idam sarvam yatkincha jagattyam jagat. So therefore, no one should encroach upon the property of the Supreme Lord: tena tyaktena bunjitha maa grudakasya svidhanam. One should accept only what is kindly awarded by him. Therefore, the earth or any other planet or universe is the absolute property of the Supreme Lord Krishna. The living beings are certainly his parts and parcels or sons, and thus every one of them has a right to live at the mercy of the Lord to execute his prescribed work. It belongs to Krishna does not mean we are not entitled to any portion of any resource in this world. It doesn't mean that. We have an entitlement as his son, as his child, as his amsha, but we have a right to only a tiny portion which is our actual requirement for executing the prescribed duties.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The authority given to a king to rule over the citizens or for that matter a government to rule over the people is for the sake of executing the will of the Lord that everybody gets their due share to execute their prescribed duty."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of kings and administrators as representatives of the Lord, contrasting ideal leadership with the degradation caused by ignorance and self-interest.

No one therefore can encroach upon the right of another individual man or animal without being so sanctioned by the Lord. The Lord's sanction is required if we have to encroach upon others. We cannot encroach, and if we do so unlawfully, we are punishable by the laws of Krishna, called the laws of material nature, the laws of God. The king or the administrator is a representative of the Lord to look after the management of the Lord's will. The authority given to a king to rule over the citizens, or for that matter a government to rule over the people, is for the sake of executing the will of the Lord, that everybody gets their due share to execute their prescribed duty. The king therefore must be a recognized person like Maharaj Yudhishtira or Maharaj Pariksit. Such kings have full responsibility and knowledge from authorities about the administration of the world. They were responsible kings, they were the ideal kings. They ensured that everybody had their quota. There was no scarcity of any material resource. So everybody was happy, everybody was living peacefully, and they were executing their duties very nicely, and everything was very nice in this world. But at times, due to the influence of the ignorance mode of material nature, tamo guna, the lowest of the material modes, kings and administrators come into power without knowledge and responsibility. And such foolish administrators live like animals for the sake of their own personal interest. Irresponsible kings, irresponsible government heads. They live a lavish life. They think they have captured power by dint of their own prowess, and they exploit the resources of material nature.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the negative consequences of irresponsible leadership, including anarchy, corruption, and suffering, especially prevalent in Kali Yuga.

Subtitles by the Amara.org community. They exploit people. They exploit the wealth which they gather as taxes. And they enjoy and lead a luxurious life without any sense of responsibility. The result is that the whole atmosphere becomes surcharged with anarchy and vicious elements. Naturally such kings cannot rule properly when they don't have the sense of responsibility, when they don't have the proper knowledge, don't have proper understanding. Then in ignorance, darkness of ignorance, they are not able to rule properly. Nepotism, bribery, cheating, aggression, and therefore famine, epidemic, war, and similar other disturbing features become prominent in human society. We see this, especially in this age. As Kali Yuga progresses, we will see more of this. Because the people are unable to understand what kind of ruler will actually be the ideal administrator. They elect somebody who promises some sense enjoyment. Because foolish people think, my only need is to satisfy my senses. They don't understand the responsibility in the human form of life is to engage in activities of self-realization and thereby make an all-around solution to all problems in this world. That people do not know. So they elect the wrong type of leader, and as a result, they suffer due to ignorance. And gradually the situation becomes goes from bad to worse.

**Key Quote:** "All these symptoms indicate the time of an incarnation of the Lord to reestablish the principles of religion and to vanquish the maladministrators."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the persecution of devotees and the rise of irreligion signal the time for the Lord's incarnation to restore Dharma, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

That's what happens. And as regards the devotees of the Lord, or the faithful, they are persecuted by such leaders who are in the mode of ignorance. All these symptoms indicate the time of an incarnation of the Lord to reestablish the principles of religion and to vanquish the maladministrators. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita: yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata... abhyuttānam adharmasya. When irreligion becomes too prominent and people neglect the real religious principles, the codes of God, then yadātmānamsrujāmyaham, Krishna says, I appear then as an incarnation. The Lord then appears in his transcendental form without any tinge of material qualities. Whichever the form, Narsimha, Varaha, or Krishna, Rama, all are transcendental forms of the Lord. No tinge of material quality. There is no material quality at all. Completely spiritual qualities. He descends just to keep the state of his creation in normal condition. And it becomes abnormal. Krishna restores normalcy.

**Key Quote:** "The normal condition is that the Lord has provided each and every planet with all the needs of the native living beings."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Krishna provides for all beings and created the material world to fulfill material desires while also offering a path to liberation through following the scriptures.

The normal condition is that the Lord has provided each and every planet with all the needs of the native living beings. If we are meant to stay on the earth planet, Krishna has provided on this earth planet everything necessary for our living comfortably and mainly for executing our prescribed duties to prepare ourselves to get out of material entanglement and go back to Godhead. They can live happily and execute their predestined occupations and attain salvation at the end, following the rules and regulations mentioned in the revealed scriptures. Everything is given by Krishna. The shastras are giving us the knowledge, information about who we are, what are our duties, what are our necessities, what is the way of securing those necessities, how should we perform our duties, and how we can prepare ourselves to attain salvation or liberation at the end of this life, especially human beings. The material world is created to satisfy the whims of the Nityabhadra or everlasting conditioned souls. We are called eternally conditioned because we cannot trace the beginning of our material existence. But nevertheless, Krishna has created this world in such a way that we can try to satisfy our material desires. At the same time, when we follow the shastras, we can also prepare ourselves to attain ultimate liberation. Both are both the purposes are there in creating this world. Actually, because we have material desires for sense enjoyment, Krishna has created this world, otherwise there would be no need of creating this world if we didn't have material desires.

**Key Quote:** "When people become intoxicated with the power of material science to exploit the resources unlawfully without the sanction of the Lord and that also only for sense gratification, there is necessity of the Lord's incarnation to chastise the rebellious and to protect the faithful."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the Lord incarnates to punish those intoxicated by material power and exploiting resources unlawfully, while protecting the faithful and re-establishing Dharma.

When people become intoxicated with the power of material science to exploit the resources unlawfully without the sanction of the Lord, and that also only for sense gratification, there is necessity of the Lord's incarnation to chastise the rebellious and to protect the faithful. So here Prabhupada is explaining when does the Lord incarnate? When people become too much intoxicated by some material power. They go on exploiting, and a stage comes when they become intoxicated with the power, we can do whatever we like, we have amassed so much of wealth, we have so much of technology, we can do whatever we want, but actually the stringent laws of nature are always working, and these foolish people cannot understand how the laws are working. So the Lord incarnates at such times, so when He descends, He exhibits His superhuman acts just to prove His supreme right, and materialists like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu, and Kamsa are sufficiently punished. The Lord punishes all these miscreants, and He protects His devotees and re-establishes Dharma. So this happens periodically that is what is being explained in this verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Krishna's Appearance vs. Birth, Internal Potency, Transcendental Activities

**Verse References:** BG 4.09
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord appears in a particular family or place by his inconceivable potency."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between Krishna's appearance and the birth of conditioned souls, emphasizing that Krishna appears through his internal potency and his activities are transcendental.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, in the Bhagavad Gita, the personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, has expressively given a description of his transcendental appearance, disappearance, and activities. Particularly in the fourth chapter, Krishna describes that even though he is unborn, he definitely does appear in this material world by his internal potency. All of us in this material world, we appear or we take birth by the force of the external energy, the illusory energy of Krishna. But Krishna appears by his internal potency, spiritual potency. So there is a very, very, very big difference between the two. There is a big difference between Krishna's appearance and our taking birth. There is a big difference. And therefore, his birth is specifically called appearance. And his, Krishna does not die. So it's called disappearance. When Krishna is out. When Krishna is out of our vision, then it is described as disappearance, and both of them are transcendental, and even his activities are completely transcendental, completely spiritual. Janma Karma Chame Divyam Evam Yo Vetthi Tatvatah. This is described by Krishna in the fourth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. That is being cited by Srila Prabhupada. He will show us this story in this purport. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, The Lord appears in a particular family or place by his inconceivable potency. That is his internal potency, his spiritual potency, his personal potency. And it is inconceivable how that internal energy is working. How that internal energy is working. He does not take his birth as a conditioned soul, quits his body and acts as another body.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna never accepts any material body. Krishna never comes in contact with the material energy."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the nature of a conditioned soul, bound by material energy, with Krishna, who never comes into contact with it and whose form is eternal and unchanging.

Conditioned soul, this has been used a few times earlier. Conditioned means completely under the control of the conditions of this material world, imposed by the external energy. And we are all spirit soul, but our spiritual nature is covered by this conditioning of the material nature. So we take birth after we quit one body. We are forced to accept another material. Krishna never accepts any material body. Krishna never comes in contact with the material energy. This is the mystery, how he appears to take birth like another human being, but he is not taking birth. Ajop is an avyayatma. His transcendental form never deteriorates. Our form, this form, it is constant. It is constantly changing. It is constantly changing. Krishna's form never changes. Krishna is always in his transcendental form, eternally. The same supreme personality of Godhead without any change in position, without any change in his qualities, without any change in his opulences. He always is the supreme lord, always is the owner, enjoyer, controller of all the opulences in existence.

#### Sun Analogy, Krishna's Appearance and Disappearance, Liberation through Understanding Krishna

**Verse References:** BG 4.09
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "His birth is like the appearance and disappearance of the sun."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of the sun's rising and setting, the speaker explains that Krishna's appearance and disappearance are not like ordinary births and deaths, and understanding this truth leads to liberation.

So that unique position of Krishna is unchanged. Therefore it is said here, he does not take his birth like a conditioned soul. His birth is like the appearance and disappearance of the sun. Srila Prabhupada is giving one example. The sun, which we can relate with, because we have experience of seeing the sun rise and set every single day. The sun arises from the eastern horizon, but that does not mean that the eastern horizon is the parent of the sun. Is it that the sun is being generated out of the eastern horizon? No. The sun exists. Even before it appears on the eastern horizon, the sun is existing. In its position, relative to our vision, the sun becomes visible in the eastern horizon at a certain time. And about 12 hours later, the sun sets on the western horizon. The sun is existent in every part of the solar system. But he becomes visible at a scheduled time. And so also becomes invisible at another scheduled time. Sunrise, sunset. Becomes visible at sunrise. And the sun becomes invisible at sunset. So this is a very good example to help us understand. Similarly, the Lord appears in this universe like the sun and again leaves our sight at another time. He exists at all times at every place. Krishna is present everywhere. And always He is present. But by His causeless mercy, when He appears before us, we take it for granted that He has taken His birth. janma karma chame divyam. Anyone who can understand this truth in terms of the statements of revealed scriptures certainly becomes liberated just after quitting the present body. That is told by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti.

When quitting the body, the present body, one who understands the truth in terms of the statements of the shastras, the revealed scriptures, such a person does not take his birth again in this material world. Instead, returns to Krishna loka, Krishna's personal abode in the spiritual world. So liberation is obtainable after many births and after great endeavor in patience and perseverance in knowledge and renunciation. Generally, liberation is not easy. The scriptures describe liberation is after many, many, many births, millions of lifetimes. And that also, after great endeavor, what is that endeavor? In cultivating spiritual knowledge and developing material detachment. These two are very important factors for liberation. But simply by knowing in truth about the Lord's transcendental births and activities, one can get liberation at once. Therefore, the importance of hearing the glories of Krishna's appearance and activities from the Srimad Bhagavatam, from the Bhagavad Gita. Of course, Bhagavatam contains much more details about Krishna's appearance and activities in his various incarnations, especially in his incarnation as Krishna. This is what is explained in the Bhagavad Gita,

**Key Quote:** "It is simply by knowing the transcendental nature of birth and activities of Lord Krishna, one can get liberation easily."
**Summary:** The speaker warns against the ignorance of atheists who see Krishna as an ordinary human, emphasizes the transcendental arrangements of Krishna's birth, and highlights the immense fortune of those who directly associated with Krishna during his earthly pastimes, concluding with the glorification of the Yadu dynasty and Mathura by the ladies of Hastinapur.

so far whatever Prabhupada has said. But those who are in the darkness of ignorance conclude that the Lord's birth and activities in the material world are similar to those of ordinary living beings, atheists and materialistic persons. They think Krishna is just another human being, which is completely wrong. Such imperfect conclusions cannot give anyone liberation. So they are unable to get liberation by coming to such wrong conclusions. His birth, therefore, in the family of King Yadu as the son of King Vasudeva and his transfer into the family of Nanda Maharaj in the land of Mathura are all transcendental arrangements made by the internal potency of the Lord. The internal potency is working to make this happen. The fortunes of the Yadu dynasty and that of the inhabitants of the land of Mathura cannot be materially estimated. How very, very fortunate they are. It is simply by knowing the transcendental nature of birth and activities of Lord Krishna, one can get liberation easily. We can just imagine what is in store for those who actually enjoyed the company of the Lord in person as a family member or as a neighbor. Krishna appeared and there were so many fortunate souls who were accompanying Krishna in his Leela in Mathura, in the Yadu dynasty, in Vrindavan. Very, very, very fortunate. So there is no doubt about their great fortune and therefore the ladies of Hastinapur are glorifying the Yadu dynasty and the land of Mathura. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So, when Krishna descends, Krishna brings with him his transcendental abode."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Dwaraka's glories surpass even the heavenly planets because Krishna resides there, bringing his transcendental abode and associates with him.

The meaning of this verse is, undoubtedly, it is wonderful that Dwaraka has defeated the glories of the heavenly planets and has enhanced the celebrity of the earth. The inhabitants of Dwaraka are always seeing the soul of all living beings, Krishna, in his loving feature. He glances at them and favors them with sweet smiles. So, this is another description by the ladies of Hastinapura about the good fortune of the residents of Dwaraka, that they are always able to see Krishna, because Krishna lives in Dwaraka, resides in Dwaraka. And, glories of Dwaraka are many, many times greater than the glories of the heavenly planets. For somebody who is a resident of the earth, heavenly planets are many times superior. But, for residents of Dwaraka, even though they are on the earth planet, Dwaraka is not like any other place on the earth, ordinary place on the earth. No, it is a very special place, because Krishna has descended. So, when Krishna descends, Krishna brings with him his transcendental abode. This is the special thing about Krishna's appearance on this world. He brings with him his transcendental abode. His personal associates of the spiritual world come with him. His opulences are about Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the heavenly planets and their inhabitants, the demigods, highlighting Indra's power and contrasting this knowledge with modern misconceptions perpetuated by scientists.

Very special that is being described here. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the heavenly planets are inhabited by demigods like Indra, Chandra, Varuna, and Vayu, and the pious souls reach there after performance of many virtuous acts on earth. So modern day people in general do not know what is heavenly planets. For galoka, they know there are many different planets which we see in the night sky, but they do not know the living conditions because they are misinformed by the so-called scientists that there is no gonna taste anything here is only like scientists no life on other planets. That's totally wrong. There is life on every planet in the entire universe, and there are different grades of living beings with different kinds of bodies suitable for living in each of the planets. So the heavenly planets are inhabited by devatas, Indra, Chandra, Varuna. So Indra, what is his power? What is his position? Please understand, he controls the rainfall on all the planets in the entire universe. So he is not a small person. He's not another comparable person to somebody on this earth planet. No, he is in a very, very, very powerful position. In one of the pastimes of Krishna described in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam, it is mentioned that Indra summoned samvarthaka clouds to pour down devastating rainfall in Vrindavan. So this is the power of Indra. He has the power to summon different clouds to pour rain in different parts of this earth planet or even the other planets. So there is a, there are a set of clouds called samvarthaka clouds. They are summoned

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of revealed scriptures for understanding the heavenly planets, including their time scales, enhanced facilities, and the beauty of their inhabitants.

by Indra to pour down devastating rainfall. At the end of Brahma's day, the middle and lower planetary systems are submerged by the waters of devastation. These are all unknown to people of the modern age who are not taking information from the revealed scriptures. They limit their knowledge to whatever they study in schools and colleges and whatever little research of the so-called scientists and other philosophers reveals to them. Their limit and knowledge is very, very poor. Poor fund of knowledge is, Prabhupada says. But from the scriptures, revealed scriptures, we get so much of knowledge about the heavenly planets, about the still higher planetary systems, Brahma loka, and even the spiritual world. That is special thing about the revealed scriptures. Now, to reach these heavenly planets, you cannot force yourself by trying to manufacture one space capsule or some space vehicle. What is that? Lunar Explorer, Mars Explorer. No, you cannot go to those, maybe the planets which presented as revealed scriptures planets by those vehicles. It is only possible to reach there after performance of pious activities as described in the scriptures. There is a qualification required to go. Modern scientists agree that the timing arrangement in the higher planetary system is different from that of the imaginands which is human oriented natural population called long that of the seasoning planets or why COBs are nototer personality system. Modern scientists agree that the timing arrangement in the higher planetary systems is different. The earth time is related. So therefore, from the revealed scriptures, we understand the duration of life on the heavenly planets is 10,000 years by our calculation. 10,000 years by our calculation. That's the duration of life of the inhabitants of the heavenly planets. How is that? Six months on earth is equal to one day on the heavenly planets and similar duration is the night. So if you consider one day and night on the heavenly planets, it amounts to one complete solar year on the earth. Facilities of enjoyment are also similarly enhanced and the beauty of the inhabitants is there legendary. There are many, many times more beautiful inhabitants of the heavenly planets than the inhabitants of this earth planet and they have much, much greater facilities for their material enjoyment. Common men on the earth are very much fond of reaching the heavenly planets, of course this

**Key Quote:** "These places are perpetually sanctified because whenever the Lord descends on earth, he displays his transcendental activities, particularly in these three places."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Dwaraka, Vrindavan, and Mathura are more important than the heavenly planets because Krishna performed his pastimes there, making them perpetually holy.

Considering all this, the heavenly planets are more celebrated than the earth. Definitely heavenly planets are much, much superior to the earth planet. But the celebrity of earth has defeated that of the heavenly planets because of Dvārakā where Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa reigned as king. This is a description of the standard of living of the inhabitants of Dvārakā when Kṛṣṇa was ruling 5000 years back. When Kṛṣṇa appeared. That is described in 10th canto. Very nice description is there. Detailed description. So when Kṛṣṇa appeared, three places namely Vṛndāvana, Mathura and Dvārakā are more important than the famous planets within the sky. Because they spread Democratic, nor do dairy. So Kṛṣṇa was born in Mathura, He was transferred to Vṛndāvana and after some 12 years or so in Vṛndāvana, He went back to Mathura and from Mathura he went to Dvārakā. So all these three places where Krishna performed his leela, his pastimes, are very, very, very special. They are more important than the most famous planets of this entire universe. These places are perpetually sanctified because whenever the Lord descends on earth, he displays his transcendental activities, particularly in these three places. Krishna chooses where he wants to perform his leela when he appears on this earth. These are the three places.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how devotees can still relish Krishna's pastimes and emphasizes the importance of our eternal position in relationship with Krishna, leading to the spiritual world.

They are perpetually the holy lands of the Lord, and the inhabitants still take advantage of the holy places, even though the Lord is now out of their sight. Even now there are devotees in Dwarka, in Mathura, in Vrindavan, who are relishing the Lord's pastimes by remembering his leelas, by meditating on his transcendental form, by hearing his glories from bona fide devotees like that. The Lord is the soul of all living beings, and he desires always to have, to be a part of the living beings in their swaroopa, in their constitutional position to participate in transcendental life, in his association. What is our actual position? It's not the position we have now, or not the positions we aspire in our ordinary material life. No, that's not our actual position. Our actual position is in relationship with Krishna, in his association. It is a spiritual position, free from all the shackles of the world. It is a spiritual position, free from all the shackles of the world. Free from all these material defects, material inebriaties, material insufficiencies. So we have got what is called as our eternal position in relationship with Krishna called svaroopa, that's our original position, and in that position we are with Krishna transcendental pastimes and experiencing the highest bliss, eternal life full of knowledge, his attractive features are sweet, very, very, very nice and his sweet smiles go deep into the heart of everyone and once it is so done, the living being is admitted into the kingdom of God. Just one glance of Krishna with his sweet smile on anyone will attract that person to actually go to the kingdom of Krishna in the spiritual world.

And having gone there, Bhagavad Gita says one never returns to this material world ever again. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita. The heavenly planets may be very famous for offering better facilities of material enjoyment, but we learn that in the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, if one goes to the heavenly planets, one comes back to this earth planet after exhausting this pious credits.

#### Krishna's devotees, purification, tapasya

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lot of tapasya they have done to get that position."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains that the intimate devotees of Krishna, like the wives and gopis, attained their position through vows, sacrifices, and worship, emphasizing the importance of purification.

In this session, we will be discussing the 28th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavad Gita. The meaning of this verse is: O friends, just think of his wives whose hands he had to bear to marry her. How they must have undergone vows, baths, fire sacrifices, and perfect worship of the Lord of the universe to constantly relish now the nectar from his lips by kissing. The damsels of Raja Bhoomi would often faint just by expecting such favors. So among the inhabitants of Dwara, particularly the ladies of Hastinapur, are glorifying the wives of Krishna and the gopis of Vrindavan. They are very intimately associated with Krishna. They are the intimate devotees of Krishna. And they are being described here that they do not get that position simply by desiring to have that position. They must have undergone vows, baths, fire sacrifices, and perfect worship of Krishna, who is the Lord of the universe. Lot of tapasya they have done to get that position.

**Key Quote:** "There is a lot of difference between bhakti and karma. Bhakti is completely spiritual. Karma is material."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's purport is discussed, highlighting the need to purify material qualities through religious rituals to render transcendental service to Krishna, differentiating between material karma and spiritual bhakti.

That's what is being described here. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: Religious rites prescribed in the scriptures are meant to purify the mundane qualities of the conditioned souls. Mundane qualities means material qualities. And these material qualities are to be purified. Because we are spirit soul, we are spiritual by nature, we have spiritual qualities which are covered by material body, by material mind, covered with material qualities. So the religious rituals described in the scriptures are meant to purify the mundane qualities of the conditioned souls by these material qualities. And what will happen if we get purified? We are gradually promoted to the stage of rendering transcendental service to the Supreme Lord Krishna. So this purification is necessary for elevating us gradually to the stage of being able to serve Krishna, to be able to recognize and render devotional service to Krishna. So devotional service is not an ordinary activity, and not everybody can take to devotional service simply by desiring or deciding to do so. No. There is a lot of difference between bhakti and karma. Bhakti is completely spiritual. Karma is material. Karma may be performed by any human being, but bhakti is only for those who are purified by the right process described in the scriptures, the religious rituals for purification. And only then one can actually begin devotional service to Krishna.

#### Swarupa, liberation, loving service

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Liberation means renovation of this stage of Swarupa."
**Summary:** The concept of Swarupa (factual identity) is explained as the highest perfection and liberation, emphasizing the importance of establishing a loving relationship with Krishna through five phases of loving service.

Further, Srila Prabhupada says, "Attainment of this stage of pure spiritual life is the highest perfection." And this stage is called Swarupa. This was mentioned in the previous verse also by Prabhupada. Swarupa. What is Swarupa? The factual identity of the living being. Each one of us, we have got a spiritual identity. The spiritual identity is called Swarupa. It's our original position in our relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world, in his association. It is a perfection, the highest perfection to be attained. Liberation means renovation of this stage of Swarupa. This is what Bhagavatam describes. Sometimes people think liberation means going to the heavenly planets. Sometimes they think liberation means merging into some void. Sometimes they think liberation means getting some mystic powers. But that is not liberation, even though they may be desired by somebody who is suffering in this material world. As freedom from suffering through these methods is possible to some extent, but ultimately, real liberation is not just freedom from suffering. Of course, those who are really liberated are free from all suffering. But beyond that, they are established in their Swarupa, in their loving relationship with Krishna. In that, they are free from suffering. And in that perfect stage of Swarupa, the living being is established in five phases of loving service. This is described in detail in the Bhakti Samrita Sindhu, which describes what is Bhakti? What is the kind of relationship in Bhakti? What are the different kinds of relationships? What is the relationship between the two? Five kinds of relationships, depending on the five kinds of service that one renders to Krishna: Shanta, Das, Chesav, Kya, Vatsalya, Madhurya.

#### Krishna's perfection, devotee's love, Madhurya Rasa, Swakhiya, Parakhiya

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna however in spite of being full in himself he becomes a master a friend a son or a husband to fulfill the intense love of the devotee concern"
**Summary:** Krishna's self-sufficiency and his willingness to reciprocate the love of his devotees are discussed, along with the different relationships (Madhurya Rasa) and the distinction between Swakhiya (married queens) and Parakhiya (unmarried gopis) relationships with Krishna.

Of these five, the stage of Madhurya Rasa, or the humor of conjugal love, is one of the five, and it is the topmost. The Lord is always perfect in himself. Thus, he is perfect in himself. There is no hankering for himself. It is not that Krishna wants some enjoyment in association with the gopis or the queens, the most beautiful personalities, because he is lacking in any way. No, Krishna is never lacking. Krishna is always full in himself. Purna, he is completely full in himself. He is the most beautiful personality. He is the greatest, and he's independent because he's full. He's independent, so he is not hankering as we, the souls of this material world, are always incomplete, imperfect. Therefore, we have a hankering. We want, so we are lacking, therefore we want. Krishna is never lacking, never eternally. He is full, perfect, completely full. Krishna, however, in spite of being full in himself, he becomes a master, a friend, a son, or a husband to fulfill the intense love of the devotee. It is a devotee's loving service to Krishna that Krishna agrees to become the master of the loving servant, the husband of the loving wife, the son of the loving mother or loving father, the friend of another loving friend. So Krishna agrees out of his causeless mercy, out of his kindness. So in this particular description of this verse, two classes of devotees of the Lord are mentioned in the stage of conjugal love: the Queens and the Gopis in Vrindavan, the Queens in Dwaraka and Gopis in Vrindavan, two classes of devotees who are situated in Madhuriya-rasa relationship. One is called Swakhiya, and other is called Parakhiya. This is very important to understand. Both of them are in conjugal love with Krishna, but there is a difference. The Queens at Dwaraka were Swakhiya relationship, or duly married wives of Dwaraka. That means there is a relationship because of being married.

**Key Quote:** "All those things are not end in themselves, but they are means to attain the highest stage of Swaroopa."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the penances undertaken by the gopis and queens to attain their positions, emphasizing that rituals and knowledge are means to achieve Swaroopa and render transcendental loving service to the Lord.

Krishna married 16,108 princesses, and they became, after marriage, his Queens in Dwaraka. Whereas the damsels of Vraja, the Gopis, young Gopis, the young friends of Lord, were his friends in Vrindavan when he was unmarried, when he was a boy. The Lord stayed at Vrindavan till the age of 16, and his friendly relations with the neighboring girls were in terms of Parakhiya. Parakhiya means it is not a relationship of conjugal love. Conjugal love means love between opposite genders, male and female. So this relationship is not due to marriage. Now these girls in Vrindavan, the Gopis, young Gopis, as well as the Queens, underwent severe penances by taking vows, bathing, and offering sacrifices in the fire as prescribed in the scriptures. How did they reach that position of becoming the beloved of Krishna, as the queen or as the Gopis? It is by undergoing severe penances that is being described in this verse. Now, the rights as they are not an end in themselves, what is described in this Shastra as the tapasya or some rata or some yagna, some dana or some yagna. All those things are not end in themselves, but they are means to attain the highest stage of Swaroopa, including the descriptions of different pious activities, different types of cultivation of knowledge, transcendental knowledge, or even perfect knowledge. Perfection in mystic powers, getting siddhis. So, jnana, karma, and siddhi, all these are not end in themselves. The ultimate perfection of these attainments is to reach the highest stage of Swaroopa, to render constitutional transcendentalism.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that the loving exchanges with Krishna are transcendental, not material, and highlights the involvement of figures like Shukadeva Goswami and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in these topics, reinforcing the spiritual nature of the subject.

To render transcendental loving service to the Lord. That is the goal. So, we should understand carefully that the kissing of the Lord, either by his wives or the gopis, is not a material act or a material quality. No. If it is material, then it is not a material act. Then Shukadeva Goswami would never have even cared to mention it in the 10th canto of the Bhagavad Gita, because Shukadeva Goswami is a very, very strict brahmachari, and he is completely free from all material desires. So, he has no interest in any material activities. He is only interested in spiritual activities. Therefore, Shukadeva Goswami elaborately described Krishna's pastimes. And even Chaitanya Mahaprabhu participated in this subject matter, even though he was a very strict sannyasi. So, therefore, we should understand this stage is attained only after severe penances of many, many, many lifetimes, and it is a transcendental position. It is not a material position.

All of these ladies are glorious. So the ladies of Hastinapura are glorifying the children of Krishna when he was in Dwarka.

married to so many queens, and even the queens, they are very glorious because Krishna had to fight against very powerful Kshatriyas in order to take them away in Swayamvara ceremony. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings were allowed to make a choice of their own bridegrooms in open competition, and such ceremonies were called Swayamvara or selection of the bridegroom." In the Vedic culture, generally the parents of the girl who is to be married will make the selection of the boy. The girls are not given a free hand in selecting their own. The boy whom they want to marry, they can select on their own. But an exception is when the qualified daughter of a powerful king is to be married, then she will marry the most competent or chivalrous Kshatriya by selecting one who is victorious in a competition. Just like even Lord Ramachandra, he married

the most powerful Kshatriya in Swayamvara ceremony. Janaka Maharaj had organized that the very, very heavy and big bow that had to be strung after lifting it, and nobody was able to do that except Lord Ramachandra. So therefore, Sita was married to Lord Ramachandra. Similarly, Draupadi also, she was married in the Swayamvara ceremony to Arjuna and later on to all the Pandavas, like that even Krishna. He defeated Shishupala and others when Lord Ramachandra were to be smoothed out. Rukmini had actually requested Krishna to actually take her away from being married to Shishupala. It was not exactly a swayamvara, but Krishna had to fight against Shishupala and other kings to take away Rukmini.

**Summary:** Discussion of the Kshatriya spirit, emphasizing the importance of chivalry and sporting competition over personal gain.

So, like this, this selection of bridegroom for exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings. Because this swayamvara was an open competition between the rival and valiant princes, such princes were invited by the father of the princes, and usually there were regular fights between the invited princely order in a sporting spirit. So, generally Kshatriyas, they like to fight when challenged or when there is a competition, and it is not done so much in an inimical spirit, not out of enmity, much out of a sporting spirit, much in a sporting spirit. But it so happened. So, sometimes the belligerent princes were killed in such marriage fighting, and the victorious princes offered the trophy princes for whom so many princes died. The Kshatriyas are ready to lay down their lives. They don't hesitate. For them, that chivalrous spirit is more important than marriage. So, they are ready to lay down their lives for the sake of protecting their own life.

**Summary:** Lamenting the decline of true Kshatriyas in Kali Yuga and the absence of Vedic military training.

So, that is Kshatriya. Such Kshatriyas are very rarely seen in this Kali Yuga. Of course, we have many people who enlist themselves in the army or navy or air force, defense forces. And they are ready to lay down their lives for the sake of protection. So, they are ready to lay down their lives for the sake of protecting the country. There are people even now. But, by and large, the Kshatriyas who can actually follow the Vedic principles and rule over a state or a kingdom or a province or a country, that is not to be found now. Such Kshatriyas are... Not available now. Who are trained up. Trained up in the military science according to their aptitude. Such training doesn't happen. There is no such training.

**Summary:** Narrating the story of Rukmini's marriage, her father's desire for her to marry Krishna, and Krishna's victory over Shishupala.

There is no such training available now. Hmm. Rukmini, the principal queen of Lord Krishna, was the daughter of the king of Vidarbha, who wished that his qualified and beautiful daughter be given away to Lord Krishna. Rukmini's father, Bhishmaka, he wanted to marry Rukmini to Lord Krishna, who was the king of Dwaraka. But, her eldest brother, that is the eldest son of Bhishmaka, his name was Rukmini. He wanted that Rukmini be given away to King Shishupala, who happened to be a cousin of Krishna. Shishupala was a cousin of Krishna. He was also the son of a very powerful ruler, Dhamma Gosha. So, there was open competition. And, as usual, Lord Krishna emerged successful.

**Summary:** Emphasizing Krishna's unlimited power and contrasting it with the limitations of living entities under the influence of Maya.

which is his, the unlimited power, which only belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna, he is never without his powers, he is always the same personality with all his powers, with all his opulences, with all his energies, with all his strength, knowledge, everything, complete, 100% complete. So, unlike the living entities, who bewildered by the material influence, lose their strength or power or knowledge or their opulence or wealth, and the living entities are totally helpless under the clutches of maya, that is not the position of the Supreme Lord, even though he may appear to be a son of another Kshatriya like Vasudeva, but he is not a person of this world, he is not a jiva, he is not a living entity like a spirit soul, he is a Supreme Personality, he is a Supreme Soul, he is always with all his powers. So, there is nothing surprising or astonishing in the descriptions which are given in the shastras about his prowess,

**Summary:** Explaining how even powerful figures like devatas are ultimately controlled by material nature, which is directed by Krishna.

by which he defeats. There are very, very, very powerful demons or powerful kings or powerful personalities or powerful devatas. After all, these devatas or kings or demons, they are under the complete control of material nature. In this material world, they are completely controlled by material nature. This way they only reach salvation and законs or the forthcoming designs of the eternal divine form. Therefore, only by the manipulation of certain material laws, do they gain some power and try to become the lord of some province or country, or state, or official entity, major name of some sovereign authority, or a city, or a status or some millimeters to which it belongs, some states or some planet even or even some planetary systems, but that is only when they are allowed to lord over by the material energy which is directed by Krishna, which belongs to Krishna.

So directly or indirectly, everyone is subordinate to Krishna. Everyone, all the created beings, all the living entities who are tiny parts of the Supreme Lord, whether a demon or a devata or a human being or any creature. So Krishna defeats everyone, and in this way, Krishna actually displayed his prowess, and he actually gave shelter to the devotees. All these are devotees. Why should Krishna do this fighting? Not because he is in need of any queen or any woman, no, it is because they are devotees of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishtira after being enlightened by what was spoken by Bhishma Deva and Lord Sri Krishna the infallible engaged himself in matters of perfect knowledge because all his misgivings were eradicated thus he ruled over the earth and seas and was followed by his younger brothers"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains Srimad Bhagavatam 1.10.3, focusing on Yudhishtira's enlightenment after the Kurukshetra war and his subsequent righteous rule.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 3rd verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Nishamya Bhishmoktam Athachyutoktam Pravritta Vijnana Vidhuta Vibhramaha Shashasa Gaam Indra Iwajitashrayaha Paridhyu Paantam Anujanu Vartitaha. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Yudhishtira, after being enlightened by what was spoken by Bhishma Deva and Lord Sri Krishna, the infallible, engaged himself in matters of perfect knowledge because all his misgivings were eradicated. Thus, he ruled over the earth and seas and was followed by his younger brothers. So this verse, Sruti Goswami is describing that just after the battle of Kurukshetra, when Yudhishtira saw that such a huge massacre had taken place, 640 million Kshatriyas were killed in that battle, it is a world war. So Yudhishtira Maharaj thought, "For me to be enthroned as the emperor, so many people had to be killed." He was very much mortified. He was aggrieved by the mass killing. So then he was enlightened by Bhishma Deva and also the Supreme Lord Krishna, and when his misgivings were all gone, then he engaged himself in matters of perfect knowledge. He properly understood what is his responsibility, how he has to rule the kingdom, how he has to guide the citizens. He ruled over the earth and the seas and was followed by his younger brothers. He had four younger brothers. All of them were righteous like him, and all of them followed his footsteps in perfectly assisting him in ruling the entire world.

#### primogeniture, religious leadership, Krishna consciousness, proprietorship

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Everything belongs to Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the historical context of Yudhishtira's rule, the concept of Krishna as the supreme proprietor, and the ideal mood of a devotee-king.

So Srila Prabhupada explains elaborately in this purport, "The modern English law of primogeniture, or the law of inheritance by the first born, was also prevalent in those days when Maharaj Yudhishtira ruled the earth and the seas." In those days, the king of Hastinapura, which is now part of New Delhi, was the emperor of the world, including the seas, up to the time of Maharaj Pariksit, the grandson of Maharaj Yudhishtira. There was only one king, there was one flag, there was one religion until the time of Maharaj Pariksit at least, as we have information from the records, historical records in the Puranas and the Tehasas. Maharaj Yudhishtira's younger brothers were acting as his ministers and commanders of state, and there was full cooperation between the perfectly religious brothers of the king. There was full cooperation, so there was no fight for supremacy because primarily they are devotees. They accept Krishna as the supreme lord, supreme controller, and if Yudhishtira is sitting on the throne, he is sitting as the representative of Krishna. He is ruling exactly according to the directions given in the shastras by Krishna himself, and therefore there is no question of any one person enjoying. As was mentioned in the first verse, Yudhishtira Maharaj could not have enjoyed freely with unrestricted consciousness, "Oh, this kingdom I have won, now I can enjoy all the power and the wealth and the resources, natural resources." No, that was not his mood. That is never the mood of a devotee. That is never the mood of a religious or righteous person. One should accept only what is necessary for his own subsistence, understanding that everything belongs to Krishna. So nobody can claim proprietorship over what is actually rightfully belonging to the supreme personality of Godhead, who is referred to as Isavasya in the Isha Upanishad, the first of the Upanishads. That Upanishad explains everything belongs to God, everything belongs to Krishna. So Yudhishtira Maharaj never thought, "Oh, this whole kingdom is mine, I can enjoy." No, everything belongs to Krishna. As a representative of Krishna, I should rule according to the codes of direction given in Dharmashastras by Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishtira was the ideal king or representative of Lord Krishna to rule over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to King Indra the representative ruler of the heavenly planets"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the origin of Vedic knowledge through Brahma and the Parampara system, comparing Yudhishtira to King Indra as a righteous ruler representing the divine will.

Scriptures are ultimately given by God, given by Krishna. Nobody sits and manufactures scriptures, as foolishly sometimes people think that Krishna is God. No, it is given by God at the beginning of creation: Tene Brahma Hrudaya Adikavaye Muhyantiya Tsuraya. In the beginning of creation, the first born creature, Lord Brahma, was instructed in the Vedic knowledge. He was impregnated with Vedic knowledge through the medium of his heart because in the beginning there was only Brahma. So Krishna directly impregnated Vedic knowledge into the heart of Brahma, and Brahma disseminated that knowledge to his sons and disciples, and that way the knowledge is coming down in Parampara. Maharaj Yudhishtira was the ideal king or representative of Lord Krishna to rule over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to King Indra, the representative ruler of the heavenly planets. Just as the Devas, just as the Devatas have Indra as their king who rules exactly according to the principles of the Shastra, same way Yudhishtira was ruling the kingdom of the earth as the representative of Lord Sri Krishna. Prabhupada explains the demigods like Indra, Chandra, Surya, Varuna, and Vayu are representative kings of different planets to the universe. They are their own planets, and they are rulers, but they don't rule whimsically, and they don't try to enjoy some material power or material wealth. No, similarly Maharaj Yudhishtira was also one of them.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Yudhishtira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern democracy"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Yudhishtira's enlightened leadership with modern democratic systems, emphasizing the importance of self-realization and returning to the kingdom of God as the ultimate goal of life.

Ruling over the kingdom of the earth. Now an important point about Maharaj Yudhishtira. Srila Prabhupada says, "Maharaj Yudhishtira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern democracy." It is noteworthy that in the modern system of government, the democratic system of government, somebody who gathers enough votes, such a person becomes the elected leader of the people, but he is not enlightened in the scriptural directions how to rule the kingdom or how to rule the country because there is a ultimate goal of life that is to be pursued by all human beings under the able leadership of a king like Yudhishtira. What is that goal? The goal is self realization in order to prepare oneself to return to the kingdom of God, to enter into the kingdom of God. That goal, you can understand now, is completely missing in the life of people. Neither the elected leaders are aware of this goal, nor the people themselves are able to ascertain this goal. They do make enquiries what is the goal of life, but they think that life in this world is limited to the duration of time between birth and death. This is all the understanding they have. They don't have understanding of the spiritual reality that each living being is spirit soul and one is changing bodies life after life, but this change of body is actually a botheration, and this material existence is a place of suffering due to the very nature of material existence, and one is meant to become self realized specially in the human form of life and prepare oneself to enter into the kingdom of God where there is no suffering, there is no death, there is no disease. You have heard this many times in earlier sessions that the kingdom of God is the ideal place of inhabitation for all of us, and we should prepare ourselves to go.

#### proper authority, scriptural guidance, modern democracy, infallible lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira simply has to follow the perfect laws given in the authorized scriptures as instructed by the infallible lord"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of learning from proper authorities, following scriptural guidance, and contrasting this with the limitations and ideological conflicts of modern democratic systems, emphasizing the need to follow the infallible Lord's instructions. The session ends with Hare Krishna.

So that is being explained by Prabhupada. Maharaj Yudhishthira was instructed by Bhishma Deva and the infallible Lord also. Therefore, he had full knowledge of everything in perfection. See, this is the way to learn from the proper source, from the proper authority, and when one becomes enlightened, then one can properly execute the principles given in the scriptures and give benefit to people which is tangible. Now Prabhupada says about the modern democratic system, "The modern elected executive head of a state is just like a puppet because he has no kingly power. Even if he is enlightened like Maharaj Yudhishthira, he cannot do anything out of his own good will due to his constitutional position. The powers of the elected leader are limited or defined by the constitution. Therefore, there are so many states over the earth quarrelling because of ideological differences or other selfish motives. Somebody claims socialist system is best system, somebody claims communist system is best, somebody claims capitalist system is best, and they keep on fighting." So this is not the way. A king like Maharaj Yudhishthira has no ideology of his own. Yudhishthira is not telling, "I have got my way of ruling." No, he had but to follow the instructions of the infallible lord and the lord's representative and the authorized agent, Bhishma Deva. Yudhishthira simply has to follow the perfect laws given in the authorized scriptures as instructed by the infallible lord. Infallible means the lord never falls down from his position. He is always the supreme lord, always full of knowledge, full of all opulences, Bhagawan, the supreme personality of Godhead, and Bhishma Deva is the perfect representative of Krishna. Such a perfect representative instructed Yudhishthira in what is Dharma, how to rule, how to ensure that citizens' well being is provided. See, it is told in the shastras that the king should follow the great authority and the infallible lord without any personal motive and manufactured ideology. Nobody should manufacture their own laws or their own principles. They should follow the perfect authority, then there is possibility of success in ruling the kingdom properly. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "actually Krishna is just reciprocating the devotional service of his devotees"
**Summary:** Krishna reciprocates the loving devotional service of his devotees, even though He is self-satisfied and doesn't need anything.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deviim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this verse is: All these women auspiciously glorified their lives despite their being without interest, without individuality, and without purity. Their husband, the lotus-eyed personality of Godhead, never left them alone at home. He always pleased their hearts by making valuable presentations. So these descriptions may appear like Krishna is a henpecked husband, but actually Krishna is just reciprocating the devotional service of his devotees. That's all Krishna is doing because Krishna has no need for anyone's service. He is full in himself, Atma Rama. He is completely self-satisfied. So it is the devotees who, out of their own devotion to Krishna, their love for Krishna, they render service to him, and the mood of the devotees, pure devotees also, that we simply want to please Krishna. Reciprocally, Krishna also accepts the service, and in return for the service, Krishna wants to please his devotees.

**Key Quote:** "only through devotion we can attract Krishna's attention"
**Summary:** The queens served Krishna with devotion, and only pure devotion, not knowledge, skill, or mystic powers, can attract Krishna.

So the description here is that the queens, they always were rendering very, very nice service to Krishna in the palace. Now, these queens were provided by Krishna with each queen one palace and so many thousands of servants to attend to every single need of the king and the queen, of Krishna and his queen. But in spite of that, the queens would personally serve Krishna. They would not depend on, they would not take the help of any of the other servants. Personally, they would tend to every need of Krishna. That is described in detail in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam. And Krishna very kindly accepted their service simply because it was offered with devotion. So only through devotion, we can attract Krishna's attention. We cannot attract Krishna's attention by any other way, not by knowledge, not by our skill, not by our perfection in some yoga practice, siddhis, mystic perfections. No. None of these things can attract Krishna because he is himself full of all mystic perfections. He is Yogeshwara. He is full of all knowledge. He is full of all varieties of opulences, wealth. So we cannot attract Krishna by our wealth, knowledge, or by our strength, nothing. But devotion, pure devotion, that attracts Krishna. So these queens attracted Krishna by their devotion. All the devotees, not only the queens, every devotee of Krishna, pure devotee of Krishna, attracts Krishna only by their pure devotion. That's all.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna accepts anything only from his pure devotees."
**Summary:** Devotional service purifies us, and Krishna accepts even mixed devotional service offered through a pure devotee spiritual master.

Nothing else can attract Krishna. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, "The devotees of the Lord are purified souls." Devotee means completely purified of all material contamination. Of course, in the beginning stage, when we begin devotional service in the neophyte stage, beginning stage, we may not be completely pure, we may be contaminated to whatever extent, but devotional service itself is purifying, itself is purifying. So we become purified as we keep on rendering devotional service according to rules and regulations, according to the principles of sadhana bhakti. But when we become completely purified, then our service comes to the level of pure devotional service. As long as there is contamination in the heart, our service is a mixed devotional service. It is not counted as pure devotional service. Nevertheless, Krishna accepts if such mixed devotional service is offered through a pure devotee, spiritual master, only then Krishna accepts. If such mixed devotional service is offered through a pure devotee, spiritual master. Mixed devotional service is never accepted by Krishna if somebody tries to do that independently. Therefore, in the beginning, we have to approach a bona fide spiritual master and render service to Krishna, begin rendering or continue to render service to Krishna through the spiritual master. Only then Krishna will accept it. Krishna accepts anything only from his pure devotees. So through the pure devotee, we can offer to Krishna some food we might have cooked. Otherwise, Krishna is not hungry or Krishna is not in need of any food. But when the pure devotee recommends that here is a sincere soul wanting to offer you some service, and Krishna very kindly accepts the seva of the neophyte devotee, even though it is mixed devotional service, he accepts it through the medium of the bona fide spiritual master who is a pure devotee.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Bhakti is never, never, never possible to be independently practiced"
**Summary:** Devotional service cannot be practiced independently; guidance from a pure devotee spiritual master is essential for progress and perfection.

Only through a pure devotee, we can offer our seva to Krishna in the mixed devotional stage, mixed devotional service stage. Otherwise, it is not possible. Therefore, don't try to do any service, devotional service independently. Independently, somebody may cultivate knowledge. Independently, somebody may practice. Independently, somebody may practice ashtanga yoga. Independently, somebody may try to perform some rituals. But that is impersonal kind of thing. You see, it doesn't depend on who the person is. They are just governed by some laws. That's all. Laws in this material world. And somebody may make progress also independently, trying to do something, cultivation of knowledge or perfecting their yoga practices, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, they may do independently. Though even in those aspects, it is recommended that one should have a guide so that you don't waste time making mistakes and trying to correct yourself through trial and error. But somebody is somehow desirous of independently practicing or trying out the practice itself. It may work, but not bhakti. Bhakti is never, never, never possible to be independently practiced, to make progress on the path of pure devotional service, it's never possible. Therefore, we see people who take to devotional service, but give up the shelter, the guidance, the teachings of the pure devotee spiritual master, they are lost in this material world. They cannot achieve perfection. Never. Perfection is never achieved that way. Whereas those who are carefully under the guidance of the pure devotee spiritual master and strictly follow his instructions without even one millimeter of deviation, they are the ones who make rapid progress. And Srila Prabhupada says, in this lifetime you can go back to Godhead. You can perfect yourself in this lifetime, go back to Godhead, irrespective of what your background had been before taking to devotional service. Even the most sinful person among sinners can take to devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee spiritual master and perfect himself very quickly.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as the devotees surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord sincerely, the Lord accepts them and thus the devotees at once become free from all material contaminations."
**Summary:** Surrender to Krishna through a pure devotee spiritual master leads to immediate purification, transcending material qualifications.

So therefore, Prabhupada says, "As soon as the devotees surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord sincerely, the Lord accepts them and thus the devotees at once become free from all material contaminations. Such devotees are above the three modes of material nature." They are not on the platform of the three gunas. Krishna says that in Bhagavad Gita: mam chayo avyabhicharena bhakti-yogena sevate sagunan samatityetan brahma bhuyaya kalpate. One comes to the spiritual platform as soon as one renders pure devotional service to Krishna, then such a service is above the three gunas. So therefore, Prabhupada says, "There is no bodily disqualification of a devotee, whether he is from a Brahminical background, or a Kshatriya background, or a Vaishya background, or a Shudra background, or a Chandala background, or a sinful background, antyaja," it doesn't matter when it comes to pure devotional service. Just as the example is given by Srila Prabhupada, "There is no qualitative difference between the Ganges water and the Fildi drain water

**Key Quote:** "anybody who renders service to Krishna through the medium of a pure devotee actually becomes purified regardless of their background."
**Summary:** Like the Ganga river, devotional service through a pure devotee purifies regardless of one's background, as exemplified by Krishna accepting the service of the women under Bhaumasura's control.

when they are amalgamated." Now the Ganga river is flowing. When it comes from the Gangotri Himalayas to Haridwar, it is crystal clear water. But as it flows down the Gangetic plains through different towns, villages, cities, till it joins the Bay of Bengal, so many drain water may join the Ganga river flow. But that doesn't mean after the drain water is joining the Ganga, Ganga does not lose any potency, spiritual potency. Ganga does not lose any spiritual potency. And even it is proven that, let us say, a person who is infected with some disease, he's got germs of the disease on his body, and such a person goes and takes bath in the Ganga river, then, immediately if you take that water, where the person has taken a bath, that water will actually have those germs. But within three hours of taking that water and keeping it aside, that water, Ganga Jal, which had those germs, all those germs will be destroyed. This has been verified by medical scientists back in the British era, that these Hindus, they claim Ganga water is very pure always. How is it possible? So they have proven that actually. It's a fact. But we are more interested in understanding that the spiritual potency of Ganga is not reduced because some drain water is mixing with the river Ganga when it flows in different parts of this, North India. Similarly, anybody who renders service to Krishna through the medium of a pure devotee actually becomes purified regardless of their background. So this is how it is said here that the women who were actually under the clutches of Bhaumasura, and they had become polluted, but when Krishna accepted them, their service, sincere service, they became completely purified. And there was no more any question of their impurity remaining. So that is the mercy of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verses 31 and 32, focusing on Krishna's departure from Hastinapura and Yudhishthira's protective arrangements driven by affection.

In this session, we will be discussing verses 31 to 32 of the 10th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. So, the 31st verse: The meaning of this verse is, while the ladies of the capital of Hastinapura were greeting him and talking in this way, the Lord, smiling, accepted their good greetings and, casting the grace of his glance over them, he departed from the city. So, the past few verses, we heard the glorification of Krishna by the ladies of Hastinapura in their talking amongst themselves when they had gone to the rooftop to bid farewell to Krishna. So, it is explained here, Krishna accepted their good greetings, and he cast his merciful glance on them, that way blessing them, and he departed from the city. The 32nd verse: Ajatashatrupritanam gopi thaya madhudvishah Parabhyah shankitathnehat prayum tacctur anginim. The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Yudhishthira, although no one's enemy, engaged four divisions of defense—horse, elephant, chariot, and army—to accompany Lord Krishna, the enemy of the asuras or demons.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Yudhishthira's arrangements for Krishna's protection, describing the four divisions of defense forces and the advanced weaponry of ancient times, including the Brahmastra.

Yudhishthira did this because of the enemy and also out of affection for the Lord. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj, he is sending off Krishna, and even though there is no need for giving any special protection to Krishna, Yudhishthira knows Krishna is the supreme personality of God, but out of affection for him, he arranged four divisions of defense forces. Those days, there used to be warriors on horseback, warriors on elephant back, warriors on chariots, and warriors on foot, foot soldiers. So, four divisions—horse, elephant, chariot, and army, what is called? Horse infantry. They were to accompany Krishna till he reached Dwaraka. So, it is explained that Yudhishthira Maharaj did this out of affection for Lord Krishna because Yudhishthira Maharaj is a pure devotee of Krishna. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, natural defensive measures are horses and elephants combined with chariots, horses, and men. Horses and elephants are trained to move to any part of the hills or forests and plains. These horses and elephants are trained up to engage in fighting in a battle by the warriors or Kshatriyas. The charioteers could fight with many horses and elephants by the strength of powerful arrows, even up to the standard of the Brahmastra, similar to modern atomic weapons.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Dhanurveda, the Vedic science of warfare, emphasizing the power of mantras in weaponry and the precision of the Brahmastra.

So, this particular science is lost. In this present age, there used to be a division of the Vedas called Dhanurveda, Vedas called Dhanurveda, how to fight with different weapons, the skill for fighting with weapons. And some of the arrows that were discharged, they were having the power of mantra, power of mantra. That means the arrow, when released to go and strike a particular target, by the power of mantra, it will go searching for the target, wherever the target may be, not necessarily the target has to be in line with the arrow being shot, not necessary. By mantra power, it will go searching for the target, and they even had a very, very powerful weapon called Brahmastra, which is similar to modern atomic weapons. But the speciality of Brahmastra is it will go and strike only the target; it will not do destruction for mass destruction. It will not do unless the Kshatriya who releases that Brahmastra desires so. So, he can select a target and release the target, and then the target will go, and it will be stopped, and then it completely is Brahmastra and to only go and strike that target and destroy that target only. So, that was the kind of

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is everyone's friend, but some beings are envious due to their demoniac nature, and Yudhishthira's actions stem from both fear of these enemies and affection for Krishna.

science, Dhanurveda. Maharaja Yudhishthira knew well that Krishna is everyone's friend and well-wisher. Krishna has no enemies because everyone is Krishna's part and parcel, and he is Surdam Sarva-Bhutana, he is the top master of the Bhuta, most well-wisher of every living being. So, where is the question of Krishna having enmity with anybody? Krishna is everyone's friend and well-wisher, but there are asuras who are by nature envious of Krishna, envious of the supreme lord is the demoniac nature. Demoniac nature is asuri bhava. So, in this material world only, not in the spiritual world, only in the material world, there are two categories of beings, created beings. In the 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, it is explained among created beings in this material world, there are two categories, daiva and asura, so divine nature and demoniac nature. Now, this is because some people, they wrongly think that Krishna is their enemy. They think Krishna is against them, or somehow they have developed some iniquities, or they have developed some kind of feelings towards Krishna. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj, out of fear of attack from others and also out of affection for Krishna,

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is self-sufficient but accepts the arrangements of his devotees to reciprocate their love and play the role of a subordinate in his transcendental sporting.

he engaged all varieties of defensive forces as bodyguards of Krishna, and also some vipassana verdigris also as a rickshaw or a bike rickshaw and some of the other movements of Krishna. Now, it is specially mentioned by Prabhupada in the purport, Krishna himself was sufficient to defend himself from the attack of others. If required, Krishna himself could defend, but still Krishna accepted all the arrangements made by Maharaj Yudhishthira. Why? Because he could use it for his own good, and if you use it for the good of others, he can't break his form as a demon because he cannot break his form, but he can't break his form with this body, and if you use it as a weapon, he can't break his form, he can't break his form with this body. Another example is this. Another example is that, for example, the existence of God in the form of a demoniac, there are different形 Grinville kusama will take it as a demoniac because he could not disobey the king who was his elder cousin. Krishna, when he plays the part of being a relative of a devotee, he plays the role perfectly. So, he was a younger cousin of Yudhishthira. So, therefore, Krishna played that part, I am younger than Yudhishthira, I cannot refuse. That is the etiquette. So, I cannot refuse when Yudhishthira arranges bodyguards for my travel, I cannot refuse it. So, Prabhupada says, the Lord plays the part of a subordinate in his transcendental sporting.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna's pastimes, such as his dependence on Yashoda Mata, as ways to give pleasure to his devotees and share transcendental bliss.

And thus, sometimes he puts himself in the care of Yashoda Mata for his protection in his so-called helplessness of childhood. A small child is after all helpless, totally dependent on the mother. When it is just born, what is the condition of the child? The infant, we do not even say child, we say infant, very, very, very small, just come out of the mother's womb, totally helpless. So, we should not mistakenly think that Krishna is helpless when he is a small child. He puts himself under the care of his mother Yashoda or Devaki as if he is a small child. But actually, he remains the Supreme Lord with all his powers, even as a small child. So, therefore, Prabhupada explains that is the transcendental lela or pastime of the Lord. Simply to give pleasure to his devotees, Krishna enacts these pastimes. The basic principle for all transcendental exchanges between the Lord and his devotees is exhibited to enjoy a transcendental bliss. So, Krishna keeps enjoying these transcendental pleasures, Krishna is full of transcendental blessings, transcendental bliss, and there is no comparison with this bliss even to the level of Brahmananda. Krishna shares that transcendental bliss with his devotees when he engages in transcendental pastimes with his devotees. So, both

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 33, highlighting the Pandavas' profound affection for Krishna and their reluctance to separate from him.

Krishna and the devotees are always in transcendental bliss. The thirty-third verse, atha duragataan shaurihi, kauravaan viraha aturan, sannivartya drdham snigdhan, praya svanagarim priyaihi. The meaning is, out of profound affection for Lord Krishna, the Pandavas, who were of the Kuru dynasty, accompanied him a considerable distance to see him off. They were overwhelmed with the thought of Krishna. The Lord, however, persuaded them to return home, and he proceeded towards Dwaraka with his dear companions. Yudhishthira Maharaj has made arrangements for bodyguards, four divisions of defense forces to accompany Krishna till Dwaraka. But even the Pandavas themselves, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Manakula, Sahadeva also could not think of separation from Krishna because they are pure devotees. All pure devotees are so. They are very intimately connected with Krishna and therefore continuously thinking of Krishna only, continuously. Such continuous thinking of Krishna is a commandment of qualities of special prestige. Krishna is also the развит 좋은 is a characteristic of devotional service to Krishna bhakti for Krishna. Krishna says, think of me always. So, even if somebody is not a devotee, if they constantly think of Krishna, they become pure devotees, they awaken their pure devotion to Krishna. So, because the Pandavas were so intimately attached to Krishna in pure devotional service, they went with him at quite a distance, but then Krishna sent them back, persuaded them to return home, and he proceeded towards Dhwaraka. So, very reluctantly the Pandavas came back because a pure devotee cannot bear separation from the Lord

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session we will be discussing from verses 34 to 36, the last three verses of this tenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. 34th verse Kurujaangala Paanchalaan Shurasenaan Sayamunaan Brahmaavartam Kurukshetram Matsyaan Saraswataan Athah Marudhanvam Atikratham Saviraviravirayoparan Anartanbhardavo Paagat Shantavaho Managvibhu This is actually the 34th and the 35th verses.

After crossing these provinces he gradually reached the Savveera and Abheera provinces, then west of these reached Dvārakā at last.

**Key Quote:** "They are real happenings. Just because it does not fit with our logical thinking, we should not reject them as mythology or something unacceptable, unbelievable."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes the historical accuracy of the Bhagavatam, refuting modern theories about the formation of deserts and the limitations of modern researchers.

So the description is Krishna has started from Hastināpura and he is going to proceed towards Dvārakā crossing the different parts of the land in between Hastināpura and Dvārakā. So Śrīla Prabhupāda explains in the purport about this different lands being described in these two verses. The provinces passed over by the Lord in those days were differently named, but the direction given is sufficient to indicate that he travelled through Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Saurashtra, and Gujarat and at last reached his home province at Dvārakā. So Prabhupāda is trying to explain these are all historical incidents and they are not imaginary stories described in the Bhāgavatam, the Pūrāṇas, the itihāsas. They are not imaginary fiction. They are not fiction. They are real happenings. Just because it does not fit with our logical thinking, we should not reject them as mythology or something unacceptable, unbelievable. It may appear unbelievable but actually it is a fact. We do not gain any profit simply by researching the analogous provinces of those days up to now. But it appears that the desert of Rajasthan and the provinces of scanty water like Madhya Pradesh were present even 5000 years ago. Some characteristics of certain land are the same or were the same 5000 years back as is indicated by the statements in the Bhāgavatam. So these are factual statements. These are not some imaginary things. The theory of soil experts that the desert developed in recent years is not supported by the statements of the Bhagavatam. Some speculation modern researchers indulge in because they have limited resources, they have limited brains and they have limited access to knowledge, so they speculate, they theorize that deserts developed in recent years. It is not there in ancient times, proposes no even five thousand years back as given in the bhagavatam, the desert portion and the part of the land where there was scanty water existed 5,000 years back. Krishna passed through that while proceeding from Hastinapura to

**Key Quote:** "Kurukshetra continues to exist since the Vedic age and it is sheer foolishness when interpreters ignore or deny the existence of Kurukshetra"
**Summary:** The speaker refutes interpretations of Bhagavad-gita that deny the literal existence of Kurukshetra, emphasizing the importance of receiving knowledge through the parampara system.

Dwaraka we may leave the matter for expert geologists to research because the changing universe has different phases of geological development. It's also a fact that the land a mass keeps changing as there are you know changes happening over very very long periods of time. It does happen so let them do the research. We are not so much interested in the research. We are satisfied that the Lord has now reached his own province Dwaraka dhama from the Kuru provinces. Kurukshetra continues to exist since the Vedic age and it is sheer foolishness when interpreters ignore or deny the existence of Kurukshetra. So Bhagavad-gita, some people write commentaries, not some people, many of them, their commentaries indicate that Kurukshetra is not actually referring to some battlefield, it is referring to the body or referring to some conflict within the mind, all kinds of speculations when are presented when the situation when it is not directly related to the body and the mind, not just in the mind but also for the body as well. So Bhagavad-gita is the source of knowledge, the method of knowledge is the source of knowledge where the 11 minded yakas are fulfilled and the knowledge of the Dharma is a source of knowledge that stil is insignificant and the understanding of this will be a lot bigger but also the The liberated souls who do not speculate, who pass on the perfect knowledge received from Krishna in parampara without any change, without any alteration, without any speculation, without any addition or subtraction or any alteration, they present as it is. Prabhupada has written Bhagavad Gita as it is. Kurukshetra is the actual place where the battle took place 5000 years back, but in the Pandavas and Kauravas. It's a factual reporting in the Mahabharata, in the Bhagavad Gita.

#### Krishna's adherence to Vedic principles, Krishna beyond karma, laws of karma

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is never under the laws of karma. Krishna is the master of all the laws of material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while Krishna appears to follow Vedic principles, he is not bound by karma, unlike ordinary beings who are subject to the laws of karma.

36th verse, the last verse. The meaning of this verse is, on his journey through these provinces, he was welcomed, worshipped and given various presentations. In the evening in all places, the Lord suspended his journey to perform evening rites. This was regularly observed after sunset. If you remember, the Lord is playing the part of a Kshatriya. So they belong to the Vedic culture. So they follow certain practices. At least the Brahmanal Kshatriyas and Vaishyas in the Vedic culture, they follow certain practices as described in the, prescribed in the Shastras, in the Vedic scriptures. So Prabhupada says in the purport, it is said here that the Lord observed the religious principles regularly while he was on the journey. There are certain philosophical speculations that even the Lord is under the obligations of fruitive action, karma. Some people say Krishna is under the laws of karma. That is wrong. Krishna is never under the laws of karma. But actually this is not the case. Krishna does not follow the laws of karma. Krishna does not depend on the action of any good or bad work. Since the Lord is absolute, everything done by him is good for everyone. Unlike us, we do some action, it is judged according to the laws of karma as pious or impious. Pious actions have got pious reactions, good reactions, and impious activities, sinful activities have got sinful reactions. So we accordingly either enjoy or suffer the results of our own activities which are under the laws of karma. Krishna is never under the laws of karma. Krishna is the master of all the laws of material nature. He is the master of material nature.

#### Krishna's example, imitating Krishna, Vedic injunctions

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna also teaches by his own example how to follow the Vedic injunctions... One must act properly himself and teach the others how to follow the Vedic injunctions by his own actions."
**Summary:** Krishna sets an example by following Vedic injunctions, but not all his actions are meant to be imitated; one must distinguish between what to follow and what not to imitate.

He is the supreme controller of material nature, so he is never under the control. But still it is explained here, when Krishna descends on earth, he acts for the protection of the devotees and for the annihilation of the impious non-devotees. Although he has no obligatory duty, still he does everything so that others may follow. Krishna also teaches by his own example how to follow the Vedic injunctions. So if he plays the part of a Kshatriya, he follows the Vedic injunctions which are prescribed for a Kshatriya. That is the way, a factual teaching. One must act properly himself and teach the others how to follow the Vedic injunctions by his own actions. Otherwise no one will accept one's blind teaching. So Krishna himself is the awarder of fructive results. He is self-sufficient. Yet he acts according to the rulings of the revealed scripture in order to teach us the process of following the Vedas. If he does not do so, the common man may go wrong. But a warning is given here. In the advanced stage, when one can understand the transcendental nature of Lord Krishna, one does not try to imitate him. This is not possible. So every action of Krishna is not meant for teaching us. Some actions are meant for teaching us. As Prabhupada explains further, the Lord in human society does what is the duty of everyone, but sometimes he does something extraordinary and not to be imitated by the living being. His acts of evening prayer as stated herein must be followed by the living beings, but it is not possible to follow his mountain lifting or dancing with the gopis. So what we should follow and what we should not imitate. This distinction must be there when we hear about or read or try to examine the activities performed by Krishna

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, one should be guided by the bona fide spiritual master. To distinguish between what we should follow among the activities of Krishna and which actions of Krishna are not to be imitated, the spiritual master should be the guide."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the sun and Shiva to illustrate the dangers of imitating powerful figures, emphasizing the need for guidance from a bona fide spiritual master in bhakti practice.

in his entire manifestation on this earth. One cannot imitate the sun which can exhaust water even from a filthy place. Example again is given of the sun. The sun is so powerful. Even the sun evaporates some filthy water from a dirty place. The sun doesn't become polluted. Ludicrous to think that sun will become contaminated. No. So the principle is the most powerful can do something which is all good, but our imitation of such acts will put us into endless difficulty. So we should not imitate the most powerful, the most powerful personalities, the controllers, what they do. Shiva drank an ocean of poison, but Shiva's followers try to imitate Shiva and they get into so much of problems. So they say Shiva smokes ganja so we can also smoke ganja, but Shiva smokes ganja for a different purpose. He has no attraction or addiction. He has no desire to enjoy smoking ganja. He does that just to give association for living entities who are in the mode of ignorance, Tamsic living entities, bhutas, pretas, pishachas, etc. Like that, Krishna performs some activities to protect his devotees, mountain lifting, govardhaniya. But we cannot imitate. We should never try to imitate that. Therefore, one should be guided by the bona fide spiritual master. To distinguish between what we should follow among the activities of Krishna and which actions of Krishna are not to be imitated, the spiritual master should be the guide for all such practices of our own, our own following the practice of bhakti. We should be guided by the spiritual master. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

The necessities of human society are food, grains, fruits, milk, minerals, clothing, wood, etc., the material needs of the body. Certainly one does not require flesh and fish or iron tools and machinery. During the regime of Maharaj Yudhishthira, all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Rainfalls are not in the control of the human being. The heavenly king Indra Deva is the controller of rains and he is the servant of the Supreme Lord Krishna. When the Lord is obeyed by the king and the people under the king's administration, there are regulated rains from the horizon and these rains are the causes of all varieties of production on the land.

Not only do regulated rains help ample production of grains and fruits, but when they combine with astronomical influences, there is ample production of valuable stones and pearls. See, even pearls which they mine from the bottom of the ocean. So, this is a great way for the human being to be able to produce intellectual property and also to be able to collect clean products from the ocean and precious stones from the earth. That is also produced by proper astronomical influences. It's a great science. It is not some mythology as foolish people think.

Now sometimes people wrongly think that a cow gives milk for its calf. Why do human beings interfere? It's not interference. The cow is made or created by the Supreme Lord Krishi Goraksha. It is to be protected by the human civilized human beings so that the excess milk that the cow gives is taken by the human beings who protect the cow and that milk nourishes the humans with the necessary nutrition for good health and most importantly for developing finer brain tissues to understand spiritual subject matter.

Human beings require cows milk for their own nourishment, especially nourishing the brain tissues to understand what is God. If there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruit, enough cotton, enough silk, enough jewels, why do people need cinemas, houses of prostitution, slaughterhouse etc.? Prabhupada is raising this point that people are mad after all these so-called entertainment and rubbish nonsense, but actually it is not required for a human being who understands the real goal of life to lead a healthy life progressing spiritually towards the ultimate goal. You don't require all this cinema and prostitution and slaughterhouse. What is the need of artificial luxurious life? You don't require all this cinema and prostitution and slaughterhouse. What is the need of artificial luxurious life? Cinema, cars, radio, flash hotels, has this civilization produced anything but quarreling individually and nationally? Prabhupada is raising this point. All modern development is only in the wrong direction, unortha, it's called unortha, unnecessary.

**Summary:** The lecture attributes scarcity and adversities to sinful activities and a godless civilization, criticizing factories as hellish environments that mass-produce unnecessary things, disrupting harmony with nature.

There is too much raining. He illustrates the crop or there is scarcity of rain which does not give proper crops. The land will not be a proper cross. So all this is because of sinful activities, because of violating the laws of God, because of a godless civilization, misdirected civilization, misdirect. So, Prabhupada is pointing this out as the Acharya of our time. He is pointing out this defect in the modern way of living. Has this civilization enhanced the cause of equality and fraternity by sending thousands of men into hellish factory and war fields at the whims of a particular man? These rulers, they have all kinds of wrong ideas that let us have factories where men work and earn money and try to enjoy artificial entertainment systems. Factories, Prabhupada says is another name for hell because the conditions are very, very bad. It is not in harmony with nature to mass produce

This is a major defect of the human nature. So, Prabhupada is pointing out this defect in the modern way of living. Has this civilization

of the modern civilization that Prabhupada is pointing out as the Acharya. Maharaj Pariksit, the grandson of Maharaj Yudhishthira, while touring his vast kingdom saw a black man attempting to kill a cow. The king at once arrested the butcher and chastised him sufficiently. This is the way to rule the kingdom that nobody should even attempt to harm a cow. Cow should be given full protection. Should not a king or executive head protect the lives of the poor animals who are unable to defend themselves? Is this humanity? Are not the animals of a country citizens also? Praja, the word Praja is used. Praja means those who take birth in a particular land. So, even the animals they also require protection. They also require protection. Why are the innocent animals allowed to be butchered in organized slaughterhouses? Therefore, in contrast with the modern advanced civilized form of government, democracy, like Maharaj Yudhishthira's, is by far superior to a so-called democracy.

**Summary:** The lecture explains Krishna as the seed-giving father and material nature as the mother of all living beings, asserting everyone's right to live under their protection and advocating non-interference with Krishna's arrangement for abundance.

This democracy is not at all a proper form of government because Maharaj Yudhishthira was perfectly ruling as the king of the entire world. Maharaj Yudhishthira was just the ruler of the entire world. He rulers the всего, and he rules the world. We are all creatures of material city, but we have to be aware of the fact that we are not the same kind of people. we are all creatures of material city, of material nature. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is said that Lord himself is the seed-giving father and material nature is the mother of all living beings on all shapes. sarva yonishu kaunteya murtaya sambhavanti yaha tasam brahma maha dyonir aham bija pradapita Krishna says, I am the seed-giving father and material nature is the source of birth for all living beings, Mother nature. So this is the way the world is created. So Krishna is the father. Mother nature is the mother of all creatures. Everyone has a right to live. We should respect their right to live under the protection of the Supreme Lord as father and material nature as mother in this material world. Thus, mother, material nature is enough foodstuff for both animals and for men by the grace of the Almighty Father Sri Krishna. We don't have to produce anything. We simply should not interfere with Krishna's arrangement. That's all. Then there'd be plenty for everyone,

He is endowed with intelligence more powerful than animals for realizing the course of nature and the indications of the Almighty Father. Human beings have developed intelligence. They can understand what is the design of this creation, that there is a creator, that is God Krishna, and he has got a plan. He's got a purpose for the behind this creation that is understood by intelligent people to make proper inquiries. So, the purpose of this creation is ultimately self-realization by utilizing whatever is provided for naturally without any difficulty simply by following the laws of God, simply by following that. So, without being guided by these enlightened self-realized souls, without being guided by the authoritative scriptures, we will be misled into thinking that there is some scarcity or there is some need for economic development or there is need for some artificial things which are being manufactured for the sake of entertainment, for the sake of reducing the these the people toiling in the factories, reducing their labor or their difficulty. All this is unnecessary. If we simply follow properly, everything is very perfect. That is the lesson to be learned from this description in the Bhagavata.

The departure of Lord Krishna for Dwarka, before actually describing the departure in this chapter, it is described the rule of King Yudhishthira. After Yudhishthira assumed the post of the emperor of the world after the Battle of Kurukshetra, then how was he ruling? That's being described here in the initial portion of this chapter. The fifth verse says, "Nadia samadra giraya." The meaning of this verse is religious oceans, hills, mountains, and falls of the oceans are mountains and falls of the mountains and falls of the mountains and falls of the mountains, forest creepers, and active drugs in every season paid their tax quota to the king in profusion. This is an interesting concept here. This verse is talking about rivers paying their tax quota to the king, and they were paying in profusion, plenty. There was plenty

of water in the rivers, of all kinds of valuables in the ocean, in the hills, in the mountains. That's being explained in the purport by Srila Prabhupada. So it's not just the citizens alone who pay the tax, and even among the citizens in the Vedic culture, only the vaisyas pay tax. The kshatriyas are rulers, and the brahmanas, they voluntarily accept to lead a very simple life. They don't accumulate money, they don't even accumulate goods, and the shudras are never given money. They are given all the necessities. They are taken care of by their masters because they always have to be under the protection of a brahmana and a shudra, a kshatriya or a vaisya. So they're taken care completely. They are never given money because there is a possibility that they may misuse the money for wrong purposes. They don't have sufficiently developed intelligence to understand the consequences of spending money for, let's say, smoking, drinking, gambling, etc. Whereas what about the vaisyas who have money in their hands or the kshatriyas? The vaisyas and kshatriyas are responsible. They are sufficiently engaged in their duties. They are very strictly, there are strict followers of the Vedic injunctions, so they are not only responsible, but they are also responsible for the, they are naturally protected and they are careful. So generally vaisyas, brahmana, kshatriyas, vaisyas do not indulge in sinful activities even if they have ample opportunity for doing that. They don't do it generally, they don't do it. So therefore money should not be given to the shudras. That doesn't mean that they should not be given to the shudras.

**Key Quote:** "The secret to success is to take refuge under the protection of the supreme lord"
**Summary:** This segment discusses how a king manages the kingdom through gifts of nature and emphasizes the necessity of the Supreme Lord's sanction for success in any endeavor.

So therefore the tax was collected by the king only from the vaisyas. So then how will the king manage the kingdom when there are a lot of expenses? The king would also receive the gifts of nature in profusion because he was ruling according to the principles of dharma. That will be explained here in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says, since Maharaj Yudhishthira was under the protection of the Ajita, Ajita is another name for Krishna, the infallible Lord, as above mentioned, the properties of the Lord, namely the rivers, the oceans, the hills, the forests, etc., were all pleased and they used to supply the respective quota of taxes to the king. Whose property is it? Rivers, oceans, hills, etc. They are the property of the Supreme Lord. So Srila Prabhupada says the secret to success is to take refuge under the protection of the Supreme Lord. That is the secret of success for the king to properly rule the kingdom without experiencing any scarcity. Without the Supreme Lord's success, without the Supreme Lord's sanction, nothing can be possible. Ultimately, for every single thing, the Supreme Lord's sanction is absolutely required to make economic development by our own endeavors on the strength of tools and machinery is not all like it is happening in the modern times. The sanction of the Supreme Lord must be there, otherwise despite all instrumental arrangements, everything will be unsuccessful.

**Key Quote:** "ultimately the cause of success is daiva or the supreme lord krishna as paramatma in the heart"
**Summary:** This segment explains the five factors required for successful accomplishment of any action, highlighting the importance of 'daivam' or the Supreme Lord's sanction.

The ultimate cause of success is daiva, the supreme. In the 18th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains five factors which are to be considered for successful accomplishment of every action in this material world. The four factors are in our hands. When we do some action, it's in our hands, four factors, but the fifth factor is called daivam, and daivam means the Supersoul, the Personality of God, Krishna, Satan in our heart is Paramatma. Ultimately, the cause of success is daiva or the Supreme Lord Krishna as Paramatma in the heart. Without His sanction, no action can be successfully accomplished. Please remember this always, always the most important factor. Of course, that does not mean that we neglect the other four factors which are in our hands, like there should be proper endeavor, there should be the proper instruments to be used, there should be the proper place or conditions for doing that action, there should be the effort on the part of the particular person, the doer. A doer is required for the accomplishment of any action. Nothing happens automatically without an effort or endeavor by a doer or a group of doers, a team effort under the guidance of a leader, and without the proper instruments of action, no action can be accomplished. But this is not all. These four factors, daiva is very, very important factor and that generally people who are other non-devotees, they do not know or they don't care for this fifth, most important factor.

**Key Quote:** "the king is the agent of the supreme lord to look after the welfare of the mass of people"
**Summary:** This segment discusses the king's role as an agent of the Supreme Lord, the concept of a welfare state, and the importance of utilizing natural resources for the service of the Lord.

Daiva. Kings like Maharaj Yudhishthira knew perfectly well that the king is the agent of the Supreme Lord to look after the welfare of the mass of people. Here the concept of welfare state is coming. The king is ruling as the representative of Krishna. Ultimately, Krishna is the supreme ruler, sarva loka maheshwaram. He is the Supreme Lord who is the controller of all planets, all persons, all demigods, everyone. So if there is a king who is ruling a particular province or a state or a kingdom or a planet, that king should understand his position as an agent of the Supreme Lord Krishna only. Actually, the state belongs to the Supreme Lord. The rivers, oceans, forests, hills, drugs, etc., are not creations of man. They are all creations of the Supreme Lord, and the living being is allowed to make use of the property of the Lord for the service of the Lord. Please understand this point. All these facilities exist for one purpose, that is human beings should utilize all the natural resources which are the property of the Lord and is provided for what? For service of the Lord. Today's slogan is that everything is for the people and therefore the government is for the people and by the people, but to produce a new species of humanity at the present moment on the basis of God consciousness and perfection of human life, the ideology of God of godly communism, the world has to again follow in the footsteps of kings like Maharaj Yudhishtira or Parikshit Maharaj. There is enough of everything by the will of the Lord, by the will of Krishna. There is plenty of all natural resources and we can make proper use of the things to live comfortably both enmity between men or between animal and man or between man and nature.

**Key Quote:** "simply we have to become god conscious that's all nothing else is required"
**Summary:** This segment contrasts a God-conscious society with a godless civilization, emphasizing that true prosperity and happiness come from becoming God-conscious.

We can live comfortably, but we should understand the secret is that the control of the Lord is there everywhere, and if the Lord is pleased, every part of nature will be pleased. The river will flow profusely to fertilize the land. The ocean will supply sufficient quantity of minerals, pearls, and jewels. This is practically unknown to modern man. What is the use of the ocean? The forest will supply wood, drugs, and vegetables, and the seasonal changes will effectively help produce fruits and flowers in profuse quantity. There will be no scarcity for anyone of any of the basic needs. There will be plenty. On the other hand, Prabhupada is commenting about the modern civilization, a godless civilization, the artificial way of living which is the case in the modern civilization, depending on factories and tools can render so-called happiness only to a limited number at the cost of millions. See what is happening today. They are producing in plenty mobile phones and electronic goods because they somehow figured out a method of mass producing these at a very cheap price and selling them in the millions to the people and diverting their attention from the main business of human life, which is God realization or service to Krishna, and thereby people suffer. So to actually get every necessity in plenty, simply we have to become God conscious. That's all, nothing else is required.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the three types of miseries (Daiva, Bhuta, and Atma) that cause suffering in the material world, explaining their origins and effects on living beings.

This is a very interesting verse that our existence in this material world is always disturbed by three kinds of miseries imposed by material nature upon all of us. So they are described here in this verse as Daiva. The disturbances or the miseries imposed by supernatural powers, the Devatas who control the wind, who control the rain, who control the heat, the sunshine, etc. So we suffer due to excessive heat or excessive cold or excessive rain or excessive wind, cyclone, tornado, hurricane, or earthquakes or epidemics. Of course, epidemics doesn't come under Daiva. Earthquakes comes under that. Then Bhuta, due to other living entities, enemies or mosquitoes or some other living beings, some wild animals or some pests like that. Then Atma, Atma refers to our own body and mind. When the body becomes fatigued, body becomes injured, body becomes old and invalid, body becomes diseased, we suffer. Or the mind, mind is disturbed due to fear, anxiety, worry, stress, we suffer. So due to our own body and mind also we suffer.

**Key Quote:** "To be non-violent to human beings and to be a killer or enemy of the poor animals is Saturn's philosophy."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the peaceful conditions under Yudhishthira Maharaj's rule with the current state of affairs, criticizing the hypocrisy of being kind to humans while harming animals.

So these are imposed upon us. As spirit soul, we are actually free from all these three. But when we are covered by this body, we have to suffer. Now in the case of the citizens of the world when Yudhishthira Maharaj was ruling as the emperor, it is described here, the citizens, citizens includes not only the human beings but also the animals. And all other creatures, Praja, Praja means those who are born in a particular land. So all those who have taken birth are entitled to be protected by the king, not just humans alone. So all of them were experiencing a very peaceful life, free from these three kinds of miseries, Klesha Daiva Bhutatma Hetavaha. So here it is said, because Yudhishthira Maharaj is not having any enemy, Ajata Shatru. He for whom enemy is never born, Ajata, never born, Shatru, Shatru means enemy. So therefore the living beings were not at any time disturbed by the enemy. They were not disturbed by mental agonies, diseases, or excessive heat or cold. They were not disturbed by any of these. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, "To be non-violent to human beings and to be a killer or enemy of the poor animals is Saturn's philosophy. This is demoniac mentality. This is not divine nature."

**Key Quote:** "Why should people kill poor animals?"
**Summary:** The speaker condemns the unnecessary killing of animals for food, advocating for vegetarianism and emphasizing the right of all creatures to live under the protection of a ruler.

Just like now-a-days, they say we should not harm human beings, other human beings. But when it comes to animals, they don't hesitate to kill animals, specially in the western countries, and now-a-days even in India. So many millions of animals are killed just because people want to eat animal flesh. When there is plenty of animal flesh, plenty of vegetables, fruits, and vegetarian grains, dal available, why should people kill poor animals? Why should they kill animals? So this is not at all justified. It is showing enmity towards animals. So this is condemned in the scriptures, unnecessary killing of any creature, not only animals, even the birds, even the insects, even the worms. Everyone has got a right to live under the protection of the ruler or the king. As was explained in the previous verse, the king is ruling on behalf of the supreme lord, and all creatures are children of the supreme lord in this world. So this perspective, that everyone has the right to live, is the perspective of the Vedic scholars in the scriptures, the Sarvejana Sukhino Bhavantu, or all creatures, may they be living happily, safely, nicely. This is the correct perspective for our own living in this world, not that we just think human beings should be not harmed, but it is okay to kill animals.

**Key Quote:** "There is enmity towards poor animals and therefore the poor creatures are always anxious."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the anxiety and suffering of animals due to human cruelty, criticizing godless governments that fail to protect them.

In this age Srila Prabhupada says there is enmity towards poor animals, and therefore the poor creatures are always anxious. They can understand, those animals, they cannot speak, but they can sense that the humans, some humans, they are very, very hard hearted, they are very cruel, and they treat these animals very badly. So always the anxiety is there. The animal can understand that they are going to be killed. The poor animals is being forced on human society. The killing is not without any after effect. Though the government may not take any action against the animal killers, because the government is a godless government, that's why. So they have got just some which punishes someone who kills another human being, but there is no punishment if somebody kills an animal, though the animal also has got a right to live under the protection of the government. But nature, which is controlled by God, nature will not spare these people who kill animals, while the animals should be actually protected, especially the cow.

**Key Quote:** "The war or this fighting between human beings is a reaction by mother nature because these people indulge in killing animals."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the widespread killing of animals to the occurrence of wars and conflicts, suggesting that these are reactions from nature.

Bhagavad Gita says go raksha, cow should be specially protected, and the other animals should not be killed. They should be left alone to live their own life, the other animals. But because so much killing is going on, there is reaction. And what way do we experience the reaction? That is explained here. Vishwila Prabhupada says, "Therefore there is always a strain of cold or hot war between men individually and collectively or nationally. Men kill each other. People kill each other in the name of nationality." One nation declares war against another nation, Vietnam war, the Iraq invasion, or all these kind of wars that happen in Syria, so much of fighting between two different groups of Islamic followers, the Shias and Sunnis, so much of fighting. And I recently heard that the United Nations is trying to stop this fighting, and it has been going on for the last 11 years. There is no respite. The militants, they attack the ordinary civilians. Ordinary civilians are attacked by the militants, and each group goes and, you know, attacks these civilians apparently belonging to the opposite group. Like Shias will go, and the Shia militants will go and attack the civilians belonging to Sunni community, and Sunni militants retaliate and attack the civilians belonging to Shia community. Civilians are completely non-violent. They don't indulge in fighting, but the militants, they want to enforce their own ideology or whatever that may be, but they are fighting against each other, and in the process so many people are either injured or killed, and it has been going on for the last 11 years without any respite. So this is what Srila Prabhupada says, that the war or this fighting between human beings is a reaction by mother nature because these people indulge in killing animals. They are indulging in killing animals.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the benefits of a God-conscious ruler who follows scriptural principles, leading to peace, happiness, and abundance for all.

Whereas here it is described in this particular verse that we are discussing, at the time of Maharaj Yudhishthira, there were no different nations. There were only eight states. Yudhishthira Maharaj was the emperor of the world. So there were many states. The whole world was united because there was one emperor, and the supreme head, being a trained king like Yudhishthira, kept all the inhabitants free from anxiety, diseases, and excessive heat and cold. That was about 5000 years back. They were not only economically well to do, as was described in the previous verse, nature used to supply plenty of all the natural resources, and they were also physically fit and undisturbed by supernatural power. They were also protected against enmity by other living beings, and they were also protected against bodily and mental agonies. So this is the result of the king being God conscious, king following the principles, the religious principles as described in the scriptures. This is nothing to do with any belief system or any kind of sectarian view of who they believe in or what they believe in now, but actually the scientific understanding that ultimately there is only one supreme lord, and he is in control, and he administers through nature justice for all kinds of unnecessary killing. This is the understanding. And so if the government or the head of state is conversant with these religious principles and rules according to the scriptural codes, then all the people will be peaceful, happy, and there will be plenty of supply. That is what is to be learnt from this particular verse.

**Summary:** This segment introduces the verse being discussed and explains Krishna's mission to reduce the burden of the earth by eliminating demoniac forces.

In this session we will be discussing from the seventh verse of the tenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. उषित्वा हास्तिनापुरे मासान कतिपयान हरिही सुहरुदाम्च विशोकाय स्वशुष्च प्रियकाम्यया The meaning of this verse is, Shri Hari, Lord Shri Krishna, resided at Hastinapura for a few months to pacify his relatives and please his own sister Subhadra. So here is a description that after the battle of Kurukshetra, it was already described that Yudhishthira Maharaj was enthroned as the emperor of the world. Now Krishna had come to Hastinapura in order for arranging this battle of Kurukshetra, in which Krishna's mission was to pacify his relatives and please his own sister Subhadra, in order for Krishna's mission of reducing the burden of this earth planet, which was overburdened by demoniac forces.

**Key Quote:** "So, the remaining demons were assembled in the battle of Kurukshetra and Krishna did not personally kill them, but Krishna and Puthana killed them."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how Krishna delivered demons, both directly and indirectly, during his pastimes and especially during the battle of Kurukshetra, emphasizing his mercy and the liberation granted to those who died in his presence.

So the lord appeared. Krishna appeared, original form of the lord appeared, Krishna appeared to reduce the burden. So, the reduction of the burden began when he was on his mother's lap, just a few days old infant, Puthana came to kill Krishna and Krishna instead of Puthana killing him, of course Krishna cannot be killed, so Krishna sucked out the life air and from there on these demons were delivered by Krishna when Krishna killed him. Puthana killed them one after another, one after another, one after another, but even after so much of killing, still some demons remained towards the end of Krishna's manifest pastimes. So, the remaining demons were assembled in the battle of Kurukshetra and Krishna did not personally kill them, but Krishna and Puthana killed them. Puthana arranged killing them through the Pandavas, his devotees. Now, the benefit for these demoniac forces or demons is that when Krishna kills them, they are delivered, they are liberated. Not only that, even when Krishna was present on the battlefield, even though they were not directly killed by Krishna, just because Krishna was present on the battlefield, because of the presence of Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, all those who died in the presence of Krishna were liberated, were delivered. So, Krishna is merciful to everyone. But nevertheless, he had to take this action because the devotees are unnecessarily harassed by the demons, unnecessarily. So, when the harassment becomes too much,

**Key Quote:** "Krishna resided at Hastinapura for a few months to pacify his relatives."
**Summary:** This segment explains why Krishna stayed in Hastinapura after the battle of Kurukshetra, focusing on pacifying relatives who lost loved ones and showing special mercy to Bhishma Deva.

Krishna personally comes or empowers his agents to actually deal with these demons. So, after that battle of Kurukshetra, after Yudhishthira was enthroned as the emperor of the world, Krishna's work is over, he has to return to Dwaraka. So, here it is described, when did he go to Dwaraka? Departure of Lord Krishna of Dwaraka. Not immediately, even though his work was over, he stayed back a few months as is described in this seventh verse. Krishna resided at Hastinapura for a few months to pacify his relatives, because in this battle, so many were killed. So, many of them were related to Krishna. So, Krishna had to pacify the survivors, and also to please his own sister Subhadra. Subhadra was married to Arjuna and that was explained by Prabhupada in the purport, why Krishna had to stay back to pacify Subhadra. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Krishna was to start for Dwaraka, his own kingdom after the battle of Kurukshetra and Yudhishthira's being enthroned, but to oblige the request of Maharaja Yudhishthira, and to show special mercy to Bhishma Deva, Lord Krishna stopped at Hastinapura, the capital of the Pandavas. Yudhishthira requested Krishna, please stay back for a few months, and Krishna accepted. But during that time, as is described in this verse, he also was pacifying his relatives, and he showed special mercy to Bhishma Deva as was described in the previous chapter.

**Key Quote:** "Subhadra was especially to be pacified because she lost her only son Abhimanyu, who was just married."
**Summary:** This segment delves into the reasons for Subhadra's grief, the circumstances surrounding Abhimanyu's death, and the events leading up to the battle of Kurukshetra, including the Pandavas' exile and Duryodhana's schemes.

He was personally present and Bhishma was to go into the body, and blessed Bhishma Deva by his presence. So, it is further said by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. The Lord decided to stay, especially to pacify the aggrieved king, Yudhishthira, as well as to please Subhadra, the sister of Lord Krishna. Now, why was Subhadra aggrieved? That is because, Subhadra was especially to be pacified because she lost her only son Abhimanyu, who was just married. Abhimanyu was the son of Subhadra and Arjuna. Subhadra was married to Arjuna. So, this Abhimanyu, he left his wife Uttara, who was the mother of Maharaja Pariksit. Now, it is described in the Mahabharata as well as the Bhagavata elsewhere, that when the Pandavas were in exile, the thirteenth year they spent in the kingdom of Virat Raj, Virat Maharaja, the kingdom of Virata, Virata Pradesh. So, they disguised themselves. Arjuna became a dancing teacher, in the court of Virat Raja. So, Virat Maharaja could not make out that this dance teacher who is seeking some engagement or employment is actually Arjuna. He could not make out because the Pandavas disguised themselves. According to the agreement in the gambling match, which was a cheating, but nevertheless, because the Pandavas lost, Yudhishthira Maharaja agreed to go and exile and stay. Those accustomed to royal comforts, they have to stay in the forest, in exile, twelve years. And the thirteenth year, they have to hide themselves somewhere. And if Duryodhana discovers where they are hiding, then they have to again go twelve years for exile, twelve more years for exile, because Duryodhana attempted to kill the Pandavas, just so that he could rule the kingdom out of his greed, though he is not entitled. It's not his rightful claim to become the emperor, but because he was greedy, somehow or the other, eliminate the Pandavas, who are the rightful claimants for the throne. So he tried to kill them, but because the Pandavas were always protected by Krishna, Duryodhana could not kill them.

**Summary:** This segment continues the narrative of Duryodhana's plot to keep the Pandavas from their rightful claim to the throne, highlighting the cheating in the gambling match and his ultimate refusal to return the kingdom, leading to the inevitable battle of Kurukshetra.

Then somehow, by trick, by cheating, send them away to the forest, and keep them in the forest forever. So this was the plot that was hatched by Duryodhana in consultation with his maternal uncle Shakuni, who was another wicked person. Same mentality as Duryodhana, demoniac mentality. Shakuni, Shakuni also. So this Duryodhana and Shakuni plotted to send away the Pandavas to exile, by cheating the Pandavas in a gambling match. And 13th year exile, what happened? That Arjuna disguised as a dancing teacher, and he became the dance teacher of Virat Maharaja's daughter, Uttara. So then, after the period of exile was over, one year is over, the 13th year, then the Pandavas revealed their identity, and they had to go back to Hastinapura to get back their kingdom, which they had lost during the gambling match, because they fulfilled the conditions. So when they went back, they were not given the kingdom back, and Duryodhana refused. So Duryodhana said, if you want the kingdom, you have to fight and defeat us, and then only take back the kingdom. So then the battle of Kurukshetra

was inevitable. But still, when Virat Maharaj came to know after the 13th year of exile of the Pandavas, that they were the Pandavas, the great Pandavas, and Arjuna, the great bowman, the greatest bowman of his time, he was living in Kognito, and he was a dance teacher. So Virat Maharaj felt very, very bad, sorry for the Pandavas. In any case, he thought that now is the opportunity for me to marry my daughter to Arjuna, when he discovered Arjuna is the one who was the dance teacher. So when he offered to marry his daughter to Arjuna, because Kshatriyas, they can marry, Arjuna is already married to Draupadi, but Kshatriyas can marry more, have more than one wife, can have more than one queen. So when he was offered, he refused because by teaching Virat Maharaja's daughter, being the dance teacher, he was like, a teacher is on the level of the father. So I am like the father of your daughter, so I cannot marry your daughter. So Virat Maharaj was very disappointed. Then he said, okay, I cannot marry, but my son can marry your daughter. So Abhimanyu was just 16 years old, but still he was a prince, and Virat Maharaj's daughter was a princess. So it was a suitable match, therefore Arjuna offered Virat Maharaj that he can marry your daughter to my son. And Virat Maharaj was very pleased, so this Virat Maharaj's daughter Uttara was married to Abhimanyu, who was the son of Arjuna and Subhadra. But soon after that, what happened, the battle of Kurukshetra was declared, had to be fought, and the Pandavas along with their sons, Abhimanyu also went to fight, but this boy never returned alive, he was killed in the battle, in the fighting. So Subhadra lost her son, Uttara, the daughter-in-law of Arjuna, lost her husband Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son. So to pacify, and Subhadra is Krishna's sister, so after the battle of Kurukshetra, because Subhadra lost her son, Krishna wanted to stay back and pacify Subhadra.

#### Krishna's affection for devotees, Devotees as relatives, Krishna's equality

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always pleased to satisfy his devotees."
**Summary:** This segment clarifies that Krishna's affection is primarily for his devotees, who take on the roles of his relatives in his pastimes, emphasizing that Krishna is equal to all but shows special affection to his devotees.

That is being described here. So that's the context in which it is said here, Krishna wanted to satisfy, pacify his sister. Now, it should be understood that, Krishna has no particular affection for his relatives, like conditioned souls have some specific affection for their own relatives. No. Krishna is actually affectionate to his devotees. And when he performs his Leela, his devotees assume the role of Krishna's relatives. Just like Devaki and Vasudeva are devotees of Krishna, but they play the role of Krishna's father and mother. Or Subhadra is the devotee of Krishna, but she plays the role of Krishna's sister. Like that. So, Krishna is always pleased to satisfy his devotees. And therefore, he stayed back to pacify his sister, who is a devotee of Krishna. Not because she's sister. She's playing the part of sister, but she's devotee. And only the devotees can play the part of sister, the devotees can play the part of the Lord's relatives. And the Lord is always absolute. He's not particularly partial to his relatives, and he's neglectful about other people, indifferent to other people. No. He's always equal to everybody, but his devotees, he's got some special affection. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Etiquette, Humility of Krishna, Krishna's Pastimes, Devotion, Personal vs. Impersonal aspect of God
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/XWi-tEQus3A?t=58

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna takes pleasure when his pure devotees treat him as an equal or treat him as a subordinate."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Krishna's humility in bowing to Yudhishtira, despite being the Supreme Lord, and how He enjoys being treated with love and affection by His devotees, even as an equal or subordinate, contrasting this with the impersonal understanding of Brahman.

In this session we will be discussing from the 8th verse of the 10th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. आमंत्र्यचाभ्यनु ज्ञातः परिश्वज्याभिवाध्यतं आरुरोह रथम् कैश्चित् परिश्वक्तो अभिवाधितः The meaning of this verse is, afterwards, when the Lord asked permission to depart and the king gave it, the Lord offered his respects to Maharaj Yudhishtira by bowing down at his feet. And the king embraced him. After this, the Lord, being embraced by others and receiving their obeisances, got into his chariot. So this was described as the title of the chapter, Departure of Lord Krishna for Dwaraka from Hastinapura. So Krishna, after finishing his work of conducting the battle of Kurukshetra, and installing Maharaj Yudhishtira as the emperor of the world, he was now leaving Hastinapura for Dwaraka. Now the description here is that Krishna, even though he is the supreme personality of Godhead, he conducts himself in an ideal manner, setting an example for everyone else, that how the younger ones should show respect to the elders. Krishna is, that is explained by Prabhupada in the purport, Maharaj Yudhishtira was the elder cousin of Lord Krishna. So Maharaj Yudhishtira is elder to Krishna. And therefore, while departing from him, the Lord bowed down at the king's feet. King refers to Yudhishtira. So Krishna is bowing down to Yudhishtira's feet. This is the etiquette, this is the culture. Krishna is younger to Yudhishtira, so therefore he is bowing down. And Yudhishtira, what is Yudhishtira doing? The king, that is Yudhishtira, embraced him as a younger brother. Yudhishtira embraced him. Although, the king knew perfectly well that Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. Yudhishtira knows. At the time of Krishna's advent in this world, 5,000 years back, very few people knew Krishna to be the supreme personality of Godhead. Most of them could not recognize him. So, this is another reason why people cannot recognize that Krishna behaves as if he is one among all of us. But then Krishna also performs activities which are extraordinary, which establish his position as the supreme lord. When Krishna is playing with the cowherd boys, it looks like he is one among them. But when there is a war, there is a danger. Some demon comes to attack. Krishna effortlessly kills the demons and dispatches them. So, that killing the demons is not at all an ordinary activity. It's not possible for anyone else to do that. Or lifting the Govardhan hill, that's not possible for anyone to do. Even though he is just a seven-year-old boy, he lifted the Govardhan hill on his little left finger. So, certain activities of Krishna are extraordinary. But if somebody hears about it, they don't have the proper understanding about who is Krishna. They tend to disbelieve it, or they tend to think it is some kind of mythological story. But actually, Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. He has unlimited power. So, it is not at all impossible for Krishna to lift the Govardhan hill, or to kill some big demons. But, Krishna also performs activities as if he is an ordinary person. So, here it is being described how the exchange took place when he was leaving Hastinapura for Dwaraka. When he was leaving Hastinapura for Dwaraka, the Lord took pleasure when some of his devotees accepted him as less important in terms of love. No one is greater than or equal to the Lord, but he takes pleasure in being treated as younger than his devotees. See, this is Krishna's transcendental pastime, that even though those who recognize him, they respect him as the supreme Lord, they offer obeisances always, under all circumstances. Everyone offers obeisances to him as the supreme Lord. But, Krishna takes pleasure when his pure devotees treat him as an equal or treat him as a subordinate. Krishna takes pleasure. So, that is the personal aspect of the Lord. The Lord is the supreme Lord, as a personality. This is the feature of a personality. That they take pleasure or they love something, then it doesn't matter whether etiquette demands something else. So, these are all transcendental pastimes of the Lord, and the impersonalist cannot enter into the supernatural role.

#### Separation from Krishna, Attractiveness of Krishna, Conditioned Souls, Devotion, Vrindavan Pastimes

**Key Quote:** "Lord Sri Krishna is so attractive for the living beings, especially for the devotees, that it is impossible for them to tolerate separation."
**Summary:** This segment explains the unbearable feeling of separation from Krishna experienced by devotees, especially the Vrajavasis when Krishna left Vrindavan, and how this separation is a testament to Krishna's supreme attractiveness and the deep love of His devotees, contrasting this with the forgetfulness of conditioned souls under the influence of illusion.

Now, as regards Bhima and Arjuna, because they were equal in age to Lord Krishna, they embraced him. So, mutually they embraced each other, because they are equals. And, Nakula and Sahadeva are younger to Krishna, therefore they bowed down to Krishna. So, this is the description of Krishna leaving for Dwaraka. He mounted his chariot, and after he was properly bowing down, and receiving embraces, etc. The 9th and 10th verse describe further, Subhadra Draupadi Kunti Virata Tanaya Tatha Gandhari Dhritarashtrascha Yuyatsur Gautamo Yamao Vrukodascha Dhaumyascha Striyo Matsya Sudadayaha Nasehire Vimukhyanto Viraham Sarangadhanmanaha This is two verses, the 9th and the 10th verses. In these verses, it is described, the translation of these two verses. At that time, Subhadra Draupadi Kunti Uttara Gandhari Dhritarashtra Yuyatsur Krupacharya Nakula Sahadeva Bhimasena Dhaumya and Satyavati, all nearby, all nearly fainted, because it was impossible for them to bear separation from Lord Krishna. So this is describing, what is the reaction of the residents of the palace of Hastinapura when Krishna was leaving for Dwarka. Krishna has mounted his chariot. Now what was the reaction? They all felt that this separation is impossible to bear for them. All these personalities. So Prabhupada explains in the purport the reason for this. Prabhupada says, Lord Sri Krishna is so attractive for the living beings, especially for the devotees, that it is impossible for them to tolerate separation. This is the meaning of the word Krishna. He is supremely attractive. So he is attractive for everyone. But then somebody may say, I don't feel attracted to Krishna. That is explained by Prabhupada here as the conditioned soul. All of us are conditioned souls in the present condition, the present situation. We are all conditioned souls. Under the spell of the illusory energy, the illusory energy forgets the Lord. So because of the influence of illusion on all of us, we forget Krishna. That means we do not recognize Krishna. We do not remember Krishna. We do not know about Krishna like that. Otherwise, the living entity can never forget Krishna. If we are not under the influence of illusion, we cannot, we can never forget Krishna. So the feeling of such separation cannot be described but can simply be imagined by devotees only. What is the kind of separation a devotee feels? Another devotee can understand that. Non-devotees cannot understand. What is this? Because this is separation from the most beloved personality, the most attractive personality, the most loving personality, the most intimately related personality. So the separation is unbearable. It's unbearable. Prabhupada also describes, not only an example is given here, Krishna leaving Hastinapura for Dwaraka, but when Krishna left Vrindavan and came to Mathura, after it is described here, after the separation from Vrindavan of the great innocent rural cowherd boys, girls, ladies and others, they all felt shocked throughout their lives, the Vrajavasis. They felt the shock of separation and they experienced that throughout their lives because Krishna never went back. Though when leaving Vrindavan, Krishna told the Vrajavasis, I'll come back after few days. I got some work in Mathura. But He never returned. Krishna never returned to Vrindavan.

**Key Quote:** "So deep and so intimate is the attachment for Krishna among pure devotees. So this we have to understand."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the intense separation felt by Radharani and the Brajavasis, their heart-rending reunion with Krishna in Kurukshetra, and the unique and varied relationships devotees have with the Lord, emphasizing the impossibility of separation for those who have directly contacted Krishna.

So the Brajavasis, rest of their life they simply were crying and crying and crying and crying in separation from Krishna. This is their attachment to Krishna. So that is described here. The separation of Radharani, the most beloved cowherd girl, is beyond expression of all the devotees. The topmost devotee is Radharani. She felt the separation the most. So then it is also described once later on, much later. They met at Kurukshetra during a solar eclipse, the Brajavasis and Krishna coming from Dwaraka to Kurukshetra. Brajavasis coming from Vrindavan to Kurukshetra. And the feeling which was expressed by them is heart-rending. The feeling the Brajavasis expressed on seeing Krishna in Kurukshetra at the time of solar eclipse, that is very, very, very touching. There is of course a difference in the qualities of the transcendental devotees of the Lord. Not all are identical that way. They have varieties of relationships. But none of them who has ever contacted the Lord by direct communion or otherwise can leave him for a moment. That is never possible. Separation is never possible. And if at all they are separated, they feel that within the core of their heart, I cannot tolerate being away from Krishna even for a single moment. A fraction of a second I cannot tolerate. So deep and so intimate is the attachment for Krishna among pure devotees. So this we have to understand.

**Key Quote:** "Simply because of the presence of Krishna, everything will be in plenty."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with a discussion of Srimad Bhagavatam 1.11.1, focusing on Lord Krishna's entrance into Dwaraka and the prosperity that arises from His presence, emphasizing the connection between Krishna consciousness and material abundance.

In this session we will be discussing from the first verse of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the beginning of the new chapter. This new chapter is entitled Lord Krishna's Entrance into Dwaraka. It is a natural sequence of the previous chapter. Previous chapter described departure of Lord Krishna for Dwaraka. Now this chapter is going to describe Lord Krishna's arrival in Dwaraka. Sūtavāca ānartāṁsa upavrajya svṛddhāṁ janapadāṁ svakāṁ dadmau dharavaram teṣāṁ viṣādam śamayan niva The meaning of this verse is Sūta Gosvāmī said, Sūta Gosvāmī speaking to the sages of Naimishāraṇya. He is describing these. Events leading to Parīkṣit Mahārāja meeting Śukadeva Gosvāmī. So Sūta Gosvāmī said, Upon reaching the border of his most prosperous metropolis known as the country of the ānartas or Dwaraka, the Lord sounded his auspicious conch shell heralding his arrival and apparently pacifying the dejection of the inhabitants. So the description is now being given. Krishna has reached Dwaraka. So he sounded his conch shell to announce, herald means to announce his arrival. And that sound of his conch shell which announced the Lord's arrival was, immediately able to pacify the dejection of the inhabitants. Dejection means the low spirits in which they were situated because of the absence of Krishna. Feeling separation from Krishna, they were in low spirits. Suddenly when they heard the conch shell, what happened? That's going to be described very nicely in the next few verses. So they are obviously very, very happy to hear that sound of the Lord's conch shell. Oh, the Lord has come back. And here the description of Dwaraka is the most prosperous metropolis. Simply because of the presence of Krishna, everything will be in plenty. Because Krishna is the source of everything. So even in the material world, material nature will supply, as was explained in the previous chapter, material nature will supply everything we require in plenty if we simply become Krishna conscious. If we simply become devotees of Krishna. So that is also being described here. The most prosperous metropolis known as Dwaraka. Called as Dwaraka.

**Key Quote:** "When the lord descends on the earth his eternal associates also come with him."
**Summary:** This segment delves into Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the inhabitants of Dwaraka as eternal associates of Krishna, their melancholia due to separation, and their intense affection for the Lord, highlighting the nature of spontaneous love of Godhead.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. The beloved Lord was away from his own prosperous metropolis of Dwaraka for a considerably long period because of the battle of Kurukshetra. Krishna had gone from Dwaraka to Hastinapura. And he wanted to enthrone Yudhishthira as the emperor of the world. Krishna had come for... reducing the burden of the earth which was overburdened by demoniac forces. Posing as Kshatriyas but actually they were demons. So the last installment of wiping out these demoniac forces was done by Krishna through the battle of Kurukshetra. In which Krishna engaged his devotees. The Pandavas. In killing all these demons. But because of Krishna's presence on the battlefield they were all liberated. And Srila Prabhupada explains. The inhabitants because of Krishna being away from Dwaraka. They were overcome with melancholia due to the separation. Melancholia means. Sadness. They were overcome with sadness because Krishna was away. So Prabhupada explains what is the relationship between the inhabitants of Dwaraka and Krishna. When the lord descends on the earth his eternal associates also come with him. So these inhabitants of Dwaraka are not ordinary people. They are eternal associates of Krishna. Just as the entourage of a king accompanies him. Entourage means. Those who surround an important personality. Wherever he goes. He does not go alone. The king. He has his ministers. He has his secretaries. He has his bodyguards. He has his servants. He has all those people surrounding him. So like that the lord also has got his eternal associates. Always appearing with him whenever he appears in this world. Such associates of the lord are eternally liberated souls. And they cannot bear the separation of the lord even for a moment. Because of intense affection for the lord. The associates are very very deeply attached to Krishna. So therefore. When the attachment is very very. Very strong. Then the separation also they cannot bear even for one moment. Thus the inhabitants of the city of Dwaraka were in a mood of dejection. In a sad mood. Low spirits. And expected the arrival of the lord at any moment. They were alert. For. Receiving news of the lord's arrival. So the heralding sound of the auspicious conch shell was very encouraging.

**Key Quote:** "These are signs of spontaneous love of godhead."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the spiritual feelings of separation and joy in the presence of the Lord, emphasizing that these are varieties of spiritual emotions accommodated in dealings between devotees and the Lord, highlighting the alertness and eagerness to receive the Lord as signs of spontaneous love.

And apparently the sound pacified their dejection. Apparently. Because. The devotees can never be. Separated from the lord. Because simply by thinking of the lord. They have his association. Simply by chanting his name. Simply by remembering his pastimes. That's the absolute nature of the lord. But still. There is a certain special feeling. In the presence of the lord. All are spiritual feelings. The feeling of separation. The feeling of. The. The feeling of. The presence of the lord bringing in a certain joy. That the lord has come back.

**Key Quote:** "By contact with Krishna, matter becomes spiritualized."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the second verse and Prabhupada's purport, explaining the spiritual significance of the conch shell reddened by Krishna's lips, symbolizing the spiritualization of matter through contact with the Lord and engagement in devotional service.

The meaning of the second verse is. The white and fat bubble. Of the conch shell. Being gripped by the hand of lord krishna. And sounded by him. He blew his conch shell. Very loudly. Apparently. Sorry. Appeared to be reddened. By the touch of his transcendental lips. The conch shell is white. Krishna is blowing by. Touching it. To his lips. And his lips are completely red. So. The conch shell appeared to become reddened. It seemed that. A white swan was playing in the stems. Of red lotus flowers. A simile is given. So pravupara explains in the purport. The redness of the white conch shell. Due to the lip touch of the lord. Is a symbol of spiritual significance. The lord is all spirit. And matter is ignorance of this spiritual existence. See. Ways to understand. What's the difference between matter and spirit. Spirit is. The spiritual substance. Of which. The spiritual world is made. Spirit is. A living. Spirit is full of life. Living symptoms. And matter is. Dead matter. It is dull. But. The actual. Understanding of matter as opposed to spirit is. Ignorance of spiritual existence. Factually there is nothing like matter in spiritual enlightenment. When somebody is spiritually enlightened. Even in the material world. For them. There is no matter. Or in other words. They are able to engage even matter in Krishna's service. And matter becomes spiritualized. When engaged in devotional service. Spiritual enlightenment takes place at once. By the contact of the supreme lord Shri Krishna. By contact. With Krishna. Matter becomes. Spiritualized. The lord is present in every particle of his existence. And he can manifest his presence in anyone. Lord is everywhere. He is present. Fully present. Everywhere. But. For manifesting his presence. We have to. Make contact. With the supreme lord. So how is this contact made? By ardent love and devotional service to the lord. One can actually. Establish that spiritual contact with Krishna. Everything in spiritual contact with the lord. Becomes spiritually reddened. Like the conch shell in the grip of the lord.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "How can we exist without your presence?"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains the feelings of the citizens of Dwaraka upon Krishna's arrival, emphasizing their longing for his presence and the joy they experience upon seeing him.

In this session we will be discussing from the 10th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Katham Vayam Natha Chiro Shite Tvai Prasanna Drishtya Khila Tapa Shoshanam Jivemate Sunda Rahasa Shobhitam Apashyamana Vadanam Manoharam Iti Chodiritha Vachachah Prajanam Bhaktavatsam Bhaktavatsalah Shunvaano Nugraham Drishtya Vitanvan Pravishat Puram. The meaning of this verse is: O Master, if you live abroad all the time, then we cannot look at your attractive face whose smiles vanquish all our sufferings. How can we exist without your presence? Upon hearing their speeches, the Lord, who is very kind to the citizens and the devotees, entered the city of Dwaraka and acknowledged all their greetings by casting his transcendental glance over them.

**Key Quote:** "All other material beauty will completely become insignificant"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unparalleled beauty of Krishna and how a glimpse of his face can completely captivate a devotee, making material beauty seem insignificant in comparison.

Krishna has reached Dwaraka city, and the citizens have so nicely expressed their feelings to Krishna that Krishna acknowledged their greetings by casting his transcendental glance over them. So here we can particularly notice that those who are pure devotees of Krishna, they are always attracted by Krishna's most beautiful and attractive face, that they cannot take their eyes off Krishna's face. So even though we have experience of beauty in this material world, this material beauty cannot be compared with Krishna's supreme beauty. So if at all we are able to get a glimpse of Krishna's beautiful face, even for a brief moment, then we get completely attracted to Krishna, and consequently all other material beauty will completely become insignificant. We will never again go after material beauty. So how do we get attracted to Krishna's beautiful form by just getting a glimpse of Krishna's beautiful face?

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The relationship between Krishna and devotees is of varieties but whatever be the variety of relationship all relationships with Krishna are very very intimate"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Krishna's smile can alleviate suffering and emphasizes the intimate and varied relationships devotees have with Krishna, highlighting Krishna's reciprocation with each devotee.

That is what is being described here, that when we cannot see your attractive face, then we are missing your beautiful smile which vanquishes all our sufferings. Of course, devotees don't suffer, but this is just to say that even if there were any suffering, it would simply disappear if the devotees just have a glimpse of Krishna's beautiful attractive face. So Krishna is very kind to his devotees, and devotees are very much attached to Krishna, so the relationship is very, very intimate. It doesn't matter what is the variety of the relationship, because the relationship between Krishna and devotees is of varieties, but whatever be the variety of relationship, all relationships with Krishna are very, very intimate. So therefore, any pure devotee of Krishna situated in any variety of relationship is always very, very much attached to Krishna, and Krishna equally reciprocates with every kind of devotee. That is a transcendental variegatedness in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "Don't hear about Krishna from unauthorized sources, from people who do not factually know Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of hearing about Krishna from pure devotees like Srila Prabhupada, who provides authoritative descriptions based on the Srimad Bhagavatam, and warns against misleading information from unauthorized sources.

There are countless devotees, all of them in the spiritual world. Krishna's personal, pure devotees, they have very intimate relationship with Krishna. They are completely absorbed in thought of Krishna. They are only engaged in serving Krishna, and Krishna personally reciprocates with each and every devotee. This we have to always remember. Don't consider Krishna to be like another person of this material world. Never make that mistake. So we have to carefully read, hear, understand the truth, tattvataha. You have to understand who is Krishna. Don't hear about Krishna from unauthorized sources, from people who do not factually know Krishna. They will be misleading you. So hear from pure devotees, and for us Prabhupad is the pure devotee who perfectly describes Krishna, and he describes Krishna from the most authoritative source, the Srimad Bhagavatam. So in the purport to this verse, Srila Prabhupad explains, "Krishna's attraction is so powerful that once being attracted by him, one cannot tolerate separation from him."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna directed Vasudeva to transfer him and hide him in Vrindavan"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Krishna's birth in Mathura, his transfer to Vrindavan to protect him from Kamsa, and his eventual return to Mathura to free his parents.

The example is there in the 10th canto of the Bhagavatam. Krishna, when he appeared 5000 years back, he was born in Mathura, and because Devaki and Vasudeva were anxious to protect Krishna, so Krishna directed Vasudeva to transfer him and hide him in Vrindavan. So Krishna in his Lila was hiding in Vrindavan for about 12 years, but actually Krishna's Lila is that his childhood he will spend in Vrindavan in the company of the Brajavasis who are his intimate devotees. Then Krishna left Vrindavan because he wanted to rescue his parents Vasudeva and Devaki who were being harassed by Kamsa, and Krishna and Balaram went from Vrindavan to Mathura in order to free his parents, and Kamsa was killed along with his associates.

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Once one is attracted by Krishna one cannot tolerate separation from him"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the narrative, describing Jarasandha's repeated attacks on Mathura and the intense feelings of separation experienced by the residents of Vrindavan when Krishna did not return.

But then Jarasandha became very envious of Krishna because Jarasandha's daughters were married to Kamsa. So when Kamsa was killed, Jarasandha's daughters became widows. Jarasandha became angry at Krishna that Krishna killed Kamsa. Jarasandha never considered why Kamsa was killed. He never thought about that. He never found fault with Kamsa. This is the way of the demoniac nature, Asuri Swabhava. So Jarasandha decided to attack Mathura and kill Krishna. Of course, demons are foolish, so foolish that they don't realize Krishna can never even be touched or approached by demons or materialistic persons, what to speak of killing Krishna. Anyway, Jarasandha decided to attack Mathura. He went with one division of army, and Krishna, in order to not disturb or involve the residents of Mathura in the fight against Jarasandha, Krishna and Balarama with few soldiers, they faced the army, huge army of Jarasandha outside Mathura, and Krishna and Balarama completely destroyed the entire army which had accompanied Jarasandha, but spared the life of Jarasandha. And Jarasandha attacked Mathura like this 17 times, and each time Jarasandha was defeated. But because Krishna became busy with all these things, the Brindavan, they were waiting for Krishna to return after finishing some business in Mathura, but Krishna never returned, so they were feeling the separation from Krishna very, very intensely, that they could not forget Krishna even for one moment, even though Krishna never returned to Brindavan. So that's why Prabhupada says, "Once one is attracted by Krishna, one cannot tolerate separation from him."

#### Eternal relationship with Krishna, Sun and Sun Rays Analogy, Artificial Separation, Molecular parts of Krishna

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "We are eternally related with Krishna as the sun rays are eternally related with the sun disc"
**Summary:** The speaker explains the eternal relationship between the living entities and Krishna using the analogy of the sun and its rays, emphasizing that the separation is artificial and due to the influence of material energy.

Why is this so? Prabhupada explains, "Because we are eternally related with Krishna as the sun rays are eternally related with the sun disc. The sun rays are molecular parts of the solar radiation. Thus the sun rays and the sun cannot be separated. Can you have sun rays without sun planet? No. Can you have sun planet without sun planet emanating sun rays? That is also not possible. So the sun rays and the sun planet are always together, always connected. Now there is something called a separation by the cloud, but that separation by the cloud of ourselves and the sun is temporary and artificial, and as soon as the cloud is cleared, the sun rays again display the natural effulgence in the presence of the sun. Similarly, the living entities who are molecular parts of the solar radiation, sorry, the living entities who are molecular parts of the whole spirit Krishna, are separated from the Lord by the artificial energy."

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 11th verse of the 11th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, describing the protection of Dwarka by the Vrishni dynasty.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 11th and the 12th verses of the 11th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 11th verse first, Madhu Bhoja Dasharhaarha Kukkurandhaka Vrishnibhihi Atma Tulya Balair Guptam Nagair Bhogavateem Iva. The meaning of this verse is, as Bhagavati, the capital of Nagaloka, is protected from the Nagas, so was Dwarka protected by the descendants of Vrishni, Bhoja, Madhu, Dasharha, Arha, Kukkura, Andhaka, etc., who were as strong as Lord Krishna. So the description is given that the residents of Dwarka were very nicely protected from the vrishnis. The reason for this is because the brothers of all the 3 great Mountains, Pushkara and Vrishna were also very well protected. They had different clans. They were divided by the Vrishnis. There were several clans of the Vrishni dynasty. They are named as Bhoja Dynasty, Madhu Dynasty, the Dasharha Dynasty, Arha Dynasty, Kukkura Dynasty, Andhaka Dynasty. So the members of these dynasties were known as the Vrishnis.

**Key Quote:** "The city of Dwarka was well protected by the descendants of Vrishni who were as powerful as the Lord insofar as he manifested his strength upon this earth"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport on the 11th verse, comparing Dwarka's protection to Nagloka and discussing the extent of Lord Krishna's manifested power.

They had three clan of Vrishni. They were protecting Dwarka because they were as strong as Lord Krishna. Now Prabhupad clarifies in the purport what is the meaning of this 'as strong as Lord Krishna.' So Srila Prabhupada first of all says the comparison is made to Nagloka. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada says the Nagloka planet is situated below the earth planet and it is understood that the sun rays are hampered there. The darkness of the planet is however removed by the flashes of the jewels set on the head of the Nagas, the celestial serpents, and it is said that there are beautiful gardens, rivulets etc. for the enjoyment of the Nagas. It is understood here also that the place is well protected by the inhabitants called the Nagas, so also the city of Dwarka was well protected by the descendants of Vrishni who were as powerful as the Lord insofar as he manifested his strength upon this earth. So we understand this point, the Lord is unlimitedly powerful, but when he descends into this world he manifests a certain strength which is required for the purpose of his pastimes, so as much strength he manifested in Dwarka for the sake of his Leela as the king of Dwarka, to that extent all the Vrishnis were powerful

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains the 12th verse, describing the opulence and natural beauty of Dwarka, contrasting it with modern cities.

enough to give sufficient protection to the residents of Dwarka. In the twelfth verse it is explained, the twelfth verse Sarvarthu Sarva Vibhava Punya Vriksha Latashramaihi Udhyana Upavana Aaramair Vrita Padmakara Shriyam. The meaning of this verse is, the city of Dwarka puri was filled with opulences of all seasons, there were hermitages, orchards, flower gardens, parks, and reservoirs of water breeding lotus flowers all over. So, Srila Prabhupada explains this beauty of the city of Dwaraka. Perfection of human civilization is made possible by utilizing the gifts of nature in their own way. As we find here within the description of its opulence, Dwaraka was surrounded by flower gardens and fruit orchards along with reservoirs of water and growing lotuses. There is no mention of mills and factories supported by slaughterhouses which are the necessary paraphernalia of the modern metropolis. The propensity to utilize nature is the same as the propensity to utilize nature.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the natural opulence of Dwarka with the problems of modern industrial civilization, highlighting the deterioration of human instincts due to factories and slums.

The propensity to utilize nature is the same as the propensity to utilize nature. Nature's own gifts is still there even in the heart of modern civilized man. The leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and reservoirs of water. But they leave the common men to reside in congested areas without parks and gardens. The leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and reservoirs of water. The leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such naturally beautiful gardens and Bloodaremos in private. The places OR basis are occupied by the leaders. But the congested SLUM areas are left for the common man. In two or three quarters is a village outskirts of Dwaraka. But in two or three quarters is a village outskirts of Dwaraka. Even if people live in your place, the village will define you as Kリணatesvara. Question is the fact that here we find of course a different description of the City of Dwaraka. It is understood that the whole Dham or the residential round quad was surrounded by such gardens and trees. It is as the city actor of Dvaraka knows some villages yet Dwaraka seems Hembred out of it. was surrounded by such gardens and parks with reservoirs of water where lotuses grow. It is understood that all the people depended on nature's gifts of fruits and flowers without industrial enterprises promoting filthy huts and slums for residential quarters. Advancement of civilization is estimated not on the growth of mills and factories to deteriorate the finer instincts of the human being. Modern civilization, the so called development of technology leads to mass production of some items in very very difficult situation in the factories.

**Key Quote:** "And such activities deteriorate the finer sentiments of the human being and society to form a dungeon of demons."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses 'ugra karma' (pungent activities) and its connection to demoniac nature, contrasting it with the spiritual atmosphere of Dwarka.

So the labor class, they are engaged in this production and they are not given proper facilities for residing in this city. And as a result of their engaging in ugra karma, pungent activities, their finer instincts as humans deteriorate. Whereas in the case of Dwarka Dham, the arrangement is such that the atmosphere helps to develop the potent spiritual instincts of human beings and that atmosphere gives them a chance to go back to Godhead. So Srila Prabhupada further explains, development of factories and mills is called ugra karma or pungent activities. This ugra karma is mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita also. In the description of divine and demoniac nature in 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, the qualities of divine natured people and the qualities of demoniac natured people are elaborately described in that 16th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. So one of the qualities described of demoniac natured people is that they engage in ugra karma, pungent activities.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between pious and impious trees, criticizing the planting of only impious trees in modern cities.

And such activities deteriorate the finer sentiments of the human being and society to form a dungeon of demons. The demoniac nature flourishes when there is such ugra karma performed by the laborers. We find herein the mention of pious trees which produce seasonal flowers and fruits. The impious trees are useless jungles only and they can only be used to supply fuels. So among trees also, pious trees and impious trees. Pious trees yield something useful like fruits, flowers or medicinal herbs like that or fragrant flowers, very sweet fruits. Whereas these impious trees, they don't give any such fruits, flowers or useful leaves. They only at best can be used for some burning the wood when the wood is dry after the tree has been cut down. In the modern civilization, such impious trees are planted on the sides of trees. You can see all over in the city. None of the roads where the government arranges to plant trees, they have any pious trees. No flowers, no fruits, only impious trees are planted.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna not only teaches by instructing us but also manifesting the ideal atmosphere, ideal development which he demonstrated in Dwarka."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of developing finer senses for spiritual understanding, utilizing nature's gifts, and highlights Dwarka as an ideal civilization demonstrated by Krishna.

Human energy, Srila Prabhupada explains, should be properly utilized in developing the finer senses for spiritual understanding in which lies the solution of life. As human beings, we have developed intelligence. So if the proper atmosphere is created, then we can develop the finer senses. And with such a development, it leads to spiritual understanding. Spiritual understanding gives us the clue for the ultimate solution to all problems. Otherwise, we are simply busy making a temporary patchwork solution to various problems in this material world. So fruits, flowers, beautiful gardens, parks and reservoirs of water with ducks and swans playing in the midst of lotus flowers and cows giving sufficient milk and butter are essential for developing the finer tissues of the human body. There is a whole plan by the Supreme Lord that this nature's gifts can be utilized for developing the finer tissues in the brain to understand spiritual subject matter and thereby prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead and thereby make a complete solution, perfect solution for all problems. As against this, the dungeon of mines, factories and workshops develop demoniac propensities in the working class. The vested interests flourish at the cost of the working class and consequently there are severe clashes between them in so many ways. You see the problem with the modern civilization. The labor class are not properly given facilities and they develop this demoniac tendency and they always keep fighting. The description of Dwarka Dham is the ideal of human civilization. So Krishna not only teaches by instructing us but also manifesting the ideal atmosphere, ideal development which he demonstrated in Dwarka.

**Key Quote:** "Whenever there is a need in the Vedic culture for decoration, they utilize such natural things."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vedic tradition of using natural decorations with modern artificial decorations, highlighting the environmental benefits of biodegradable natural products compared to non-biodegradable materials like plastic.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, signs of decoration in special festivals were also collected from the gifts of nature such as the plantain trees, the mango trees, fruits and flowers. Mango trees, coconut palms and plantain trees are still accepted as auspicious signs. Whenever there is a need in the Vedic culture for decoration, they utilize such natural things. They don't manufacture artificially some decorative items. Such artificial decorative items are later on very difficult to dispose of. Just like nowadays so much of hue and cry, about plastic, the plastic waste is very difficult to dispose of. Whereas all these natural products, they are, as is said, biodegradable. So, there is no difficulty in disposing them off. And they are easily available without much endeavor on the part of the people to purchase them. So, there is no difficulty in disposing them off.

The entrance of the temple, the picture of Hanuman and Garuda are always painted at the entrance, even the deity of Hanuman Garuda are there in the beginning of the temple, so they are the great servitors of the Lord. Both render valuable service to the Supreme Lord. For devotees such paintings and decorations are still adored and the servitor of the master is paid more respects for the satisfaction of the Lord. Krishna says in Bhagavatam, madbhakta puja abhyadika, worship of my devotee is greater than worship of me. Krishna says that in Bhagavatam eleventh canto while instructing Uddhava. So Hanuman and Garuda are great servants of the Supreme Lord, so when they are paid respects by the devotees the Lord is thoroughly pleased by such respects paid to his dear

**Summary:** The speaker narrates pastimes of Krishna with Garuda and Rama with Hanuman, emphasizing their selfless service and contrasting it with the misuse of power for sense gratification in the material world.

servants. So the flags were decorated with paintings of Garuda or Hanuman. So in the Bhagavatam there is a description of different pastimes of the Lord with Garuda participating in those pastimes. When Krishna went with Satyabhama to the Indra loka to get one parijata tree, that time he went on the back of Garuda. And when Krishna had to fight against Banasura, then during one month he, similar to the time pressure on Lord Shiva to get the tree, then he went to, he was carried to that capital of Banasura by Garuda and Garuda also was assisting the Lord in fighting against Banasura. So in this way even Hanuman, Hanuman serves the Supreme Lord in his form as Ramachandra and Ramayana, the elaborate description is there how Hanuman served Lord Rama in so many ways. Hanuman is extraordinarily powerful but he uses all that power only for service of Lord Rama, not for any other purpose. As opposed to that, people in this world due to some pious credits if they have got some power they want to utilize that for their own good, for lauding over others or for their own sense gratification. But the devotees never utilize anything they may have or they may possess or they may acquire for their own sense gratification, they never use it for lauding over others because the Supreme Lord is the Lord of everyone, he is the Lord and everything should be utilized for His service.

This is the devotion of Garuda, great personalities, they have extraordinary power, abilities but everything is used simply for devotional service of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 14th verse, describing the cleanliness and opulence of Dwarka, where roads were cleansed and scented with natural flower extracts to welcome the Lord.

They teach us the ideal way of utilizing whatever we may possess. The 14th verse: samarjit mahamarga rathya apanaka chatwaram siktaam gandha jalair uptaam phala pushpakshatam kuraihi. The meaning of this verse is: the highways, subways, lanes, markets and public meeting places were all thoroughly cleansed and then moistened with scented water. See the opulence of Dwarka is to clean all the roads thoroughly with water and then sprinkle scented water, nice fragrance to welcome the Lord. Fruits, flowers and unbroken seeds were strewn everywhere and this is also the opulence of the inhabitants of Dwaraka. So many fruits, so much flowers are there because the flower gardens are giving plenty of flowers and fruit orchards are supplying plenty of fruits. So they can afford to strew them everywhere in order to welcome the Lord on the streets, in the junction places, road junctions and in the arches. So Srila Prabhupada explains, scented waters prepared by distilling flowers like rose and khevra, were requisitioned to wet the roads, streets and lanes of Dwaraka Dham. Again, scent is not artificially prepared by some chemicals but rather by distilling natural flowers which have got nice fragrance. Such places along with the market place and public meeting places were thoroughly cleansed.

**Key Quote:** "Cleanliness is very prominent in Vedic civilization."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of cleanliness in Vedic civilization and contrasts the former abundance of parks and gardens with the modern-day concrete jungles in cities.

So clean. So cleanliness is very prominent in Vedic civilization. That means they are situated in the goodness, mode of goodness. If not in the transcendental spiritual platform. Of course Dwaraka Nivasis are on the transcendental platform. But even those who are not on the transcendental platform, they should at least be in the mode of goodness. That helps to develop the pious activities leading to ultimate development of bhakti. From the above description it appears that the city of Dwaraka Dham was considerably big, containing many highways, streets and public meeting places with parks, gardens and reservoirs of water, all very nicely decorated with flowers and fruits. Nowadays we don't find so many parks or gardens in cities especially, because people have become very very greedy for constructing so many buildings. The cities are more like concrete jungles, especially the most developed cities even in our country. Formerly there used to be more gardens and parks and open spaces.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna consciousness leads to an abundance of natural resources and describes Dwaraka as an ideal city where everyone was devoted to Krishna.

But now you don't find that. To welcome the Lord such flowers and fruits with unbroken seeds of grain were strewn over the public places. This is the opulence of the residence of Dwaraka. Of course when Krishna Consciousness is there, there is plenty of supply of everything by material nature, because material nature is directed by the Supreme Lord. Maya Dhyakshena Prakriti Hisu Yatesu Characharam. So the Lord will direct nature to supply everything when people are God conscious, Krishna conscious. When people become sinful then material nature withholds the production of grains and fruits and flowers, and grains won't be sufficient like that. Unbroken seeds of grain or fruits in the seedling stage were considered auspicious, and they are still so used by the Hindus in general on festival days. So this is the culture, that decorations are done using natural supplies by nature, natural gifts like fruits, flowers, unbroken seeds, water pots with yogurt and grains like that. So Dwaraka, so Dwaraka where Krishna resided with all the Vrishnis, his relatives and friends and his family members was the ideal city and everyone there was devoted to Krishna, were devotees of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Without distribution of food no function is complete and that is the way of Vedic tradition"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's teachings about the importance of worshiping the Lord with requisite ingredients and distributing the remnants (prasadam) as an essential part of Vedic culture.

So Srila Prabhupada says a very important point here in the purport: the process of reception according to Vedic rites is not at all dry. The reception was made not simply by decorating the roads and streets as above mentioned, but by worshiping the Lord with requisite ingredients like incense, lamps, flowers, sweets, fruits, and other palatable eatables according to one's capacity. You see, so worship of the Lord is the center point in all these decorations, all the arrangements, worship of the Lord. So the Vishnu Purana says the entire varnashrama dharma aims at worship of Vishnu by all the members of this society irrespective of which classification they belong. The worship of the Lord Vishnu is the goal of practicing varnashrama dharma and only by worship of Vishnu, the Supreme Lord, can we perfect our life, can we prepare ourselves to get ultimate liberation and go back home, back to Godhead. So that was clearly demonstrated by the Supreme Lord Vishnu, these devotees of Dwaraka, how they received the Lord and how they worshipped him. So Srila Prabhupada further says all were offered to the Lord, everything that they were using for decorating and the items they had kept ready to receive the Lord, they were used to not only decorate but also to offer to the Lord like incense, lamps, fruits, and edibles, different eatables, and the remnants of foodstuff are distributed amongst the gathering citizens. So it was not like a dry reception of these modern days. Modern days they have reception for some important personalities or leaders but there is no distribution of foodstuff, there's no worship of the Lord, that is missing, that is lacking. Each and every house was ready to receive the Lord in a similar way and thus each and every house on the roads and streets distributed such remnants of food to the citizens and therefore the festival was successful. Without distribution of food no function is complete and that is the

**Key Quote:** "If they eat food which is not offered to Krishna, then they are eating sin."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita to explain that eating food not offered to Krishna leads to sinful reactions, emphasizing the importance of offering food as a sacrifice.

Vedic culture. This is the Vedic culture, that Vedic culture means worship of the Lord and the remnants are distributed to the people who participate in this festival. So it's not a dry reception or dry festival, no. So Prabhupada says no function is complete in the Vedic culture without distribution of food. Regarding distribution of food, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains in the third chapter, thirteenth verse, yajna shishta asinaha santaha mucchante sarva-kilbhishaihi bunjate tetu agham paapa ye pachanti atmakaranat. Very important verse, where Krishna describes in this third chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, that devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins, because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Yajna is sacrifice, yajna shishta is remnants of food offered for yajna. Others who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita. Bunjate means they eat. Who? Agham paapa, huge quantities of sin. Who are they? Ye pachanti, those who prepare food, atmakaranat, for their own sense enjoyment. There is no offering made to the Supreme Lord. So, nowadays you can see, most people, they simply purchase some ready-made food, and eat it, or they prepare something at home that is also simply prepared and eaten. They do not know that they have to worship the Lord and offer him foodstuff, and only accept remnants of food. So, what is wrong if simply somebody eats without offering to the Lord? It is explained in this verse of the Bhagavad Gita, if they

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So when we are to offer food, we should remember, we should offer food only that is in the mode of goodness."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that taking birth in the material world is due to past sinful activities and that we should offer food in the mode of goodness to Krishna.

Our taking birth itself in this material world is because of our past sinful activities. So we already are carrying a load of sinful reactions from our past life or past lives. Now adding to that more sinful reactions by not offering food and simply consuming food, not offering food is only going to increase our suffering in this world. Regarding the type of food that should be offered to Krishna, Krishna accepts only food which is in the mode of goodness. So what is food in the mode of goodness? It is described in the 17th chapter, 8th verse. āyuḥ sattva balārogyaḥ sukhaḥ prīti vyavardhanāḥ rasyaḥ snigdhāḥ sthirāḥ hṛdyāḥ āhārāḥ sātvikaḥ priyāḥ That which is in the mode of goodness, food is in the mode of goodness, increase the duration of life, āyuḥ. Purify one's existence, sattva. Bala, they give strength. ārogyaḥ, they promote good health. Sukhaḥ means they give happiness. And prīti vyavardhanāḥ and they give satisfaction. And further characteristics of such food, such nourishing foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. So unless food is palatable, unless food is of this characteristic, it is not in the mode of goodness. Typically, food in the mode of passion is very, very pungent, extremely spicy. Excess of spice is used or excess of salt or excess of sourness, chili, like that. And food in the mode of ignorance is completely decomposing and stale. And that which is untouchable, in the Vedic language, untouchable is that which is stool and flesh, animal flesh, animal eggs, animal remains. So these are all untouchables.

**Key Quote:** "Prasadam distribution should be there."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of performing sacrifices in the mode of goodness and emphasizes the significance of prasadam distribution in temples, following Srila Prabhupada's instructions.

So when we are to offer food, we should remember, we should offer food only that is in the mode of goodness. And further, regarding sacrifice, Krishna says in the 17th chapter, 13th verse, The meaning of this verse is, That sacrifice performed in defiance of scriptural injunctions, in which no spiritual food is distributed, no hymns are chanted, and no remunerations are made to the priests, and which is faithless, that sacrifice is of the nature of ignorance. So merely doing a sacrifice is not enough. The sacrifice has to be performed in the mode of goodness. So the characteristic of Tamsik sacrifice, or sacrifice in the mode of ignorance is, food is not distributed. As opposed to this, what was described in this 15th verse, in the description of Dwaraka Dham, how they received Krishna, they worshipped Krishna, they offered night foodstuffs to him, and the remnants were distributed among the people. Even when Prabhupada established his Kaun temples, he always said, Prasadam distribution should be there. Prasadam distribution should be there. So it's the Vedic culture, the temple's food is offered to the deity, who is worshipped, Krishna or Vishnu deity, and the remnants are distributed among the temple visitors. This is the Vedic culture. Prasadam distribution.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the benefits of prasadam distribution in Kali Yuga, emphasizing its ability to purify the heart, awaken devotion, and facilitate spiritual advancement, ending with a Hare Krishna.

Prasadam distribution is also important in Kali Yuga because people can purify their heart of sinful reactions simply by taking Prasadam, Krishna Prasadam. And not only it purifies their heart of sinful reactions, but it also awakens their dormant devotion. Prasadam is completely satisfying to the tongue and even to the mind. Prasadam nourishes the body very nicely. So such Krishna Prasadam should be offered, nice preparation should be offered, palatable, sweet, juicy, nourishing. Foods in the mode of goodness should be offered to Krishna and the remnants should be distributed. Only then will people easily become Krishna conscious. They will progress on the path of bhakti and they will be able to actually make spiritual advancement, develop all good qualities that are to be found in devatas. Asyasthi bhakti bhagavati akinchana sarvair gunaistatra samasate suraha All good qualities are to be found in those who engage in pure devotional service and develop all divine qualities.

**Key Quote:** "So, all the eight daughters of Devaka, Ugrasena's brother, were married by Vasudeva."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to describe the personalities mentioned in the verses, starting with Vasudeva, detailing his lineage, marriages, and relationship to Krishna and other important figures.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada gives a brief description of each of these personalities. First of all, he describes the personality of Vasudeva. Now, all these personalities actually are participating in Krishna Leela in certain roles. But actually, in the spiritual world, their actual position may be different in some cases. So here, it's described Vasudeva was the son of King Shurasena. Shurasena was ruling, King of the district of Shurasena. And his son was Vasudeva. Krishna appeared as the son of Vasudeva and husband of Devaki. Vasudeva married Devaki, and Devaki was the mother of Krishna. Krishna appeared from the womb of Devaki. And, of course, Vasudeva is described as the father of Lord Shri Krishna. He is also, Vasudeva is also the brother of Kunti. Kunti is the mother of the Pandavas. So, Kunti's brother is Vasudeva. And Vasudeva is also the father of Subhadra. Vasudeva and Devaki had eight sons and one daughter. That one daughter was Subhadra. Krishna appeared as, was born as, the eighth son of Vasudeva and Devaki. Balaram actually was the seventh son of Vasudeva and Devaki, but he was transferred to the womb of Rohini by Krishna's own arrangement for his lila, for his pastimes. Then further, Srila Prabhupada says, Subhadra was married with her cousin, Arjuna, because Subhadra and Arjuna are daughter and son of Vasudeva and Kunti, who are brother and sister. So, therefore, Subhadra and Arjuna are cousins. But Srila Prabhupada says, such marriage is permitted, and this system is still prevalent in some parts of India, even today. Vasudeva was appointed minister of Ugrasena, and later on, he married eight daughters of Ugrasena's brother, Devaka. Ugrasena's brother, Devaka, had eight daughters. Devaki was one of them. So, Vasudeva not only married Devaki, but he also married the other seven sisters of Devaki. So, all the eight daughters of Devaka, Ugrasena's brother, were married by Vasudeva.

**Key Quote:** "This is called Krishna Leela, actually."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Vasudeva and Devaki, focusing on Kamsa's attempts to kill Krishna, the transfer of Balaram to Rohini's womb, and Krishna's eventual birth and transfer to Gokula.

Kamsa was his brother-in-law. That means Kamsa, as the son of Ugrasena, was the brother-in-law of Vasudeva. Vasudeva accepted voluntary imprisonment by Kamsa on mutual agreement. Then, to deliver the eighth son of Devaki, this is described in the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam, that before Krishna's appearance, there was a prophecy that the eighth son of Devaki would be the cause of death of Kamsa. So, Kamsa immediately arrested. He was about to kill Devaki, but Vasudeva somehow convinced Kamsa not to kill Devaki, on the promise that every child born of Devaki, he would hand over to Kamsa. So, Kamsa, in order to ensure that every child that is born would be handed over to him, he imprisoned Vasudeva and Devaki. Now, this Kamsa, cruel Kamsa, killed the first six sons born of Devaki and Vasudeva, Shatgarbha. And, when Devaki became pregnant for the seventh time, then that child was transferred by arrangement of Yogamaya, by Krishna's arrangement through Yogamaya, the seventh son of Devaki and Vasudeva was transferred to Rohini's womb, from Devaki's womb. That was Balaram. And, Kamsa thought the seventh pregnancy was a miscarriage. The child died in the womb. That's what Kamsa thought. And then, Krishna appeared as the eighth son in the womb of Devaki, but when Devaki was pregnant for the eighth time, Kamsa was just waiting. Now, this child is going to take birth. I must kill this child as soon as it's born. But, Kamsa could not actually lay his hands on the child, eighth child which is born of the womb of Devaki. Krishna appeared middle of the night by potency of Yogamaya. Kamsa and all the doorkeepers and prison keepers were all asleep under the influence of Yogamaya. And, that is when Vasudeva and Devaki offered wonderful prayers to Krishna when Krishna appeared. And, because they were anxious to protect Krishna, Krishna instructed Vasudeva to transfer him from the prison of Kamsa to the house of Nanda Maharaj and Yashoda, from Mathura to Gokula. And, that's what Vasudeva did in the middle of the night. And, while all this was happening, Kamsa is fast asleep and all his doorkeepers are also asleep. So, this is called Krishna Leela, actually. It's Krishna's pastime.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the divine nature of Krishna's activities and the importance of understanding them through scripture, continuing with Vasudeva's role as the maternal uncle of the Pandavas and his eventual disappearance.

His appearance, his activities are all divine. And, how to understand these activities as divine is explained in the Srimad Bhagavatam in great detail. We should not speculate or we should not give our own interpretation. No. We should hear from the scriptures the divine nature of all of Krishna's activities. Then, further, it is described Vasudeva as the maternal uncle of the Pandavas. That means, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, their mother's brother, maternal uncle is Vasudeva. So, as maternal uncle of Pandavas, he took active part in purificatory processes of the Pandavas, Samskaras. When Krishna appeared within the bars of Kamsa's prison house, Krishna was transferred by Vasudeva to the house of Nandaman. That's what I explained in detail. Krishna disappeared along with Baladeva prior to the disappearance of Vasudeva. Therefore, Arjuna took charge of funeral ceremony after Vasudeva's disappearance. These are all pastimes of Krishna and his devotees, intimate devotees. They are also under the protection of Yoga Maya.

So, Akrura is famous for having offered wonderful prayers to Krishna and perfected his devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "Bhakti is so nice, simply by hearing about Krishna, simply by singing Krishna's glory, simply by offering prayers to Krishna or simply by remembering Krishna's pastimes, one can achieve all."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the power of bhakti and continues describing Akrura's role in Krishna's pastimes, including his support of Arjuna's marriage to Subhadra and his presence at Abhimanyu's wedding.

Bhakti is so nice, simply by hearing about Krishna, simply by singing Krishna's glory, simply by offering prayers to Krishna or simply by remembering Krishna's pastimes, one can achieve all. The power of perfection, complete self-realization and ultimate liberation. That is the power of bhakti. So Akrura is described as the commander-in-chief of the Vrishni dynasty. He was also a Kshatriya. But most importantly, Akrura is a great devotee of Lord Krishna. He was the husband of Suthani, who was the daughter of Ahuka. Ahuka is another name for Ugrasena, so Ugrasena is the father-in-law of Akrura. Akrura married daughter of Ugrasena. Now, Akrura supported Arjuna when Arjuna took Subhadra forcibly away by the will of Krishna. Subhadra is Krishna's sister. Now, Krishna wanted to marry his sister to Arjuna, but Balaram wanted to marry his sister to Duryodhana. So Krishna arranged that before Balaram could fix that marriage, Arjuna kidnapped Subhadra, and Krishna and Akrura actually went and met Arjuna after the kidnapping. So both of them presented dowries to Arjuna after this incidence because there was no proper marriage like that. Then Akrura was also present when Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra, was married with Uttara, the mother of Maharaj Pariksit.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the verses and the personalities to be discussed, focusing on the joy of Krishna's devotees upon his arrival.

OM NAMO BHAGVATE VASUDEVAYA NARAYANAM NAMASKRITTYA NARAM CHAIVANAROTTAMAM DEVIM SARASVATHIM VYASAM TATO JAYAM UDIRAYET In this session we will continue discussing from the same 16th and 17th verses of the 11th chapter of 1st canto.

**Key Quote:** "So by the grace of Lord Krishna and Lord Balaram, Kamsa was killed, and Ugrasena was re-installed on the throne."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Ugrasena's history, including his imprisonment by Kamsa, his divine nature, and his eventual reinstatement as king by Krishna and Balarama, also highlighting his inquiry to Narada about Krishna's divinity.

So here is a description about Ugrasena. Ugrasena was one of the powerful kings of the Vrishni dynasty and cousin of Krishna. Ugrasena was the son of Maharaj Kuntibhoja. His other name is Ahuka. His minister was Vasudeva and his son was the powerful Kamsa. This Kamsa imprisoned Ugrasena and forcibly became the king of Mathura. Ugrasena was ruling Mathura, but Kamsa imprisoned his own father because Kamsa was a demoniac natured person. Ugrasena was divine natured. So they are of opposite natures, so they don't get along. Demons don't get along with divine natured people and demons unnecessarily give trouble to divine natured people, unnecessarily. So by the grace of Lord Krishna and Lord Balaram, Kamsa was killed, and Ugrasena was re-installed on the throne. When Shalva attacked the city of Dwaraka, Ugrasena fought very valiantly and repulsed the enemy. Ugrasena was not a weak Kshatriya, he was a powerful Kshatriya. So Shalva was a very, very powerful king. So Ugrasena was able to resist Shalva's attack and fought very bravely. Ugrasena inquired from Narada about the divinity of Lord Krishna. See, even Ugrasena, he's a devotee, but still, one has to hear from proper spiritual authorities about the actual divine position of the Supreme Personality of God. So Ugrasena inquired from Narada about the divinity of Lord Krishna. So Narada is an authority.

**Key Quote:** "So Krishna decided to actually bring about an apparent quarrel between the members of the Yadu dynasty themselves, and they killed each other."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna orchestrated the dissolution of the powerful Yadu dynasty through internal conflict.

When the Yadu dynasty was to be vanquished, Ugrasena was entrusted with the iron lump produced from the womb of Samba. This is a pastime, how the Yadu dynasty itself would actually be dissolved, because they were very, very powerful. They defeated everyone else, but how would they end their manifestation? So Krishna decided to actually bring about an apparent quarrel between the members of the Yadu dynasty themselves, and they killed each other. And that's the way they actually disappeared from the surface of this globe, from the earth.

#### Balarama, Rohini, Vasudeva, Nanda Maharaj, plenary expansion, Vishnu Tattva

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Balarama is the plenary manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the first expansion of Krishna in the spiritual world he is Krishna's own expansion but still they act as if they are two independent personalities that's the way they behave and act that's the nature of Godhead so he is as powerful as Lord Krishna this plenary manifestation he belongs to the Vishnu Tattva the principle of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker details Balarama's birth, his upbringing under Nanda Maharaj, and his position as the plenary expansion of Krishna, emphasizing his power and connection to the Vishnu Tattva.

Maharaj along with his mother Rohini when Vasudeva embraced imprisonment by mutual agreement with Kamsa, so Vasudeva had 16 Queens of which Rohini and Devaki were two of them, so Krishna appeared as the son of Devaki and Balarama appeared as the son of Rohini, but when Balarama appeared Rohini was under the protection of Nanda Maharaj, so Balarama grew up in Vrindavan along with Krishna as his son of Rohini, but Balarama was introduced to Nanda Maharaj as his father, the child when it is just born, so it is born from the womb of a particular mother, so since he appeared from the womb of Rohini, Rohini is his mother, then who is the father? Because father actually is Vasudeva, he is in imprisonment under Kamsa, so therefore he grew up under the care of Nanda Maharaj as his foster father as much as Krishna grew up under Nanda Maharaj as his foster father, same Balarama also. So this is Leela. Lord Krishna and Balarama were constant companions from their very childhood although they were stepbrothers, but actually Balarama is the plenary manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the first expansion of Krishna in the spiritual world, he is Krishna's own expansion, but still they act as if they are two independent personalities, that's the way they behave and act, that's the nature of Godhead, so he is as powerful as Lord Krishna, this plenary manifestation, he belongs to the Vishnu Tattva.

#### Balarama's pastimes, anger, forgiveness, spiritual strength, Adi Guru

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Now in the Vedas, Balarama is described as a supreme lord without whose favor one cannot realize the absolute truth."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts Balarama's pastimes, including his anger towards Arjuna and the Kauravas, his eventual forgiveness, and his role as the original spiritual master (Adi Guru) who bestows spiritual strength.

He attended the Swayamvara ceremony of Draupadi along with Krishna. When Subhadra was kidnapped by Arjuna by the organized plan of Krishna, Balde was very angry with Arjuna and wanted to kill him at once. But Krishna for the sake of his dear friend Arjuna, he fell at the feet of Balarama and implored him not to be so angry. So Balde was thus satisfied by Krishna pacifying him and Arjuna's life was spared. Once, Balarama was very angry with the Kauravas and he wanted to throw their whole city into the depths of the Yamuna. But the Kauravas realized their mistake in not agreeing to Balarama's proposition. So then they begged forgiveness and Balarama at once forgave them, and then he actually pardoned and he did not do so. So they were actually saved. The Kauravas were saved. Now in the Vedas, Balarama is described as a supreme lord without whose favor one cannot realize the absolute truth. Now, Bala means spiritual strength, not physical strength. So less intelligent people interpret this Bala as some physical strength, but Bala means spiritual strength. So no one can have spiritual realization without the mercy of Balarama. So therefore, Balarama is described as the original spiritual master, Adi Guru.

Next, the description of Pradyumna. He is an incarnation of Kamadeva. He was born as the son of the personality of Godhead, Krishna and Rukmini. Rukmini is the principal queen of Krishna. He was very angry with his charioteer. Why did you remove me from the battlefield? It's actually a quality of a Kshatriya. He never turns his back and retreats from a battle. Either he will win or he will lay down his life. That's the way a Kshatriya has to fight. So he went back to the battlefield and he was victorious over Shalva. He fought very bravely and is victorious. He is actually originally one of the four plenary expansions of Krishna was Vasudeva Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha or one of the four expansions of Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by describing the Rajasuya Yagna performed by Yudhishthira to glorify Krishna and emphasizes the deep attachment and devotion of Krishna's associates.

He was present during the Rajasuya Yagna of Maharaja Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira, in order to glorify Krishna, he performed Rajasuya sacrifice in which Krishna was elected as the president of the Yadu dynasty. Krishna was the president of that big assembly of all great saintly persons, all sages, all Rajarshis, all Devatas. They were all present. Krishna was elected as the president. So Yudhishthira just did this to glorify Krishna. That's all. When all the Vrishnis were assembled during the time of Prabhasa Yagna, Samba's glorious activities were narrated by Satyaki before Lord Krishna. He was also present with his father Lord Sri Krishna during the Ashwamedha Yagna performed by Yudhishthira. So, Samba died in that fratricidal war between the members of the Yadu dynasty. So all these sons of Lord Krishna, they left their respective palaces and lived in the Yadu dynasty. They left their respective palaces and leaving aside all other engagements, whether lying down, sitting, dining, whatever. They hastily went towards their exalted father Krishna because they were very intimately attached to Krishna. That means all of the associates of Krishna are his intimate devotees, and they are very, very, very attached to Krishna. That is the special feature of devotion to Krishna. The attachment to Krishna is very, very, very strong. It's very, very powerful, because Krishna attracts everyone in that way. The name Krishna means all attractive. So he is attractive to everyone, particularly to his intimate devotees. He is very, very attractive. So I'll stop here. Thank you. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "the Vedic way of receiving great personality creates an atmosphere of respect which is saturated with affection and veneration for the person received."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic way of receiving a great personality, emphasizing the atmosphere of respect, affection, and veneration it creates.

In this session we will be discussing from the eighteenth and the nineteenth verses of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The eighteenth verse first. वारनेंद्रम् पुरस्कृत्या ब्रामनै ससुमंगलैही शंकत् तूर्य निनादेन ब्रह्मः घोषेन चाद्रताह प्रत्यु जग्मू रथैर खृष्टा प्रनयागत साध्वसाह. The meaning of this verse is the eighteenth verse: They hastened towards the Lord on chariots with brahmanas bearing flowers. Before them were elephants, emblems of good fortune. Conch shells and bugles were sounded and Vedic hymns were chanted. Thus they offered their respects which were saturated with affection. So, the previous two verses described how the family members of Krishna, the intimate family members, they rushed towards, hastened towards Krishna with great affection and they actually, it is described here, they were carrying flowers and they were on chariots and brahmanas were chanting Vedic hymns and conch shells and bugles were sounded and they offered their respects saturated with affection. So, Srila Prabhupada says the Vedic way of receiving great personality creates an atmosphere of respect which is saturated with affection and veneration

for the person received. So, this program of reception is full of sincerity on part of both the receiver and the received.

**Key Quote:** "we may not hate even the prostitutes if they are devotees of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of prostitutes being among those who received Krishna, and explains Prabhupada's perspective that even prostitutes can be devotees.

because Krishna is the most respectable personality. The 19th verse: Vaara Mukhyascha Shata Sho Yaanai Stad Darshanot Sukhaha Lasat Kundalan Nirbhata Vaara Mukhyascha Shata Sho Yanai Stad Darshanot Sukhaha Lasat Kundalan Nirbhata Kapola Vadana Shriyaha Kapola Vadana Shriyaha Kapola Vadana Shriyaha Kapola Vadana Shriyaha. The meaning of this 19th verse is: At the same time many hundreds of well-known prostitutes began to proceed on various vehicles. They were all very eager to meet the Lord and their beautiful faces were decorated with dazzling earrings which enhanced the beauty of their foreheads. This is very interesting. That among the many different persons who received Krishna when Krishna entered Dwaraka there were hundreds of well-known prostitutes. Now Srila Prabhupada explains this very nicely. How come prostitutes are there in Dwaraka and they are going to receive Krishna? Prostitutes are devotees. So here Prabhupada explains we may not hate even the prostitutes if they are devotees of the Lord. Even to date there are many prostitutes in great cities of India who are sincere devotees of the Lord. So you may wonder how can somebody be engaged in such a sinful activity as a prostitute and at the same time be a devotee of Krishna? The two don't go together, isn't it?

**Key Quote:** "devotional service to Lord Krishna is uncheckable in all circumstances."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service is an activity of the soul, and is separate from one's profession or external circumstances, meaning anyone can become a devotee.

So Prabhupada explains by tricks of chance one may be obliged to adopt a profession which is not very adorable in society but that does not hamper one in executing devotional service to the Lord. So devotional service to Lord Krishna is uncheckable in all circumstances. That means devotional service is an activity of the soul and a profession adopted for some maintenance in the material world is with respect to the body, external body. So external body may be that of one engaged in a profession as a Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisa, Shudra but or even a prostitute as a profession but that does not prevent anyone from becoming a devotee of Krishna. So much so that Shastras say even a Chandala can be a devotee of Krishna. Chandala is an outcast, is an outcast fifth class person in the Varnashrama system. Chandala means the lowest of the four Varnas, lower than the fourth Varna also, lower than the Shudra. But even a Chandala can take to devotional service by the mercy of Lord Krishna or his pure devotee. So pure devotees preach Krishna consciousness to everyone. Irrespective of who the person is and by the blessings and mercy of a pure devotee anyone can become a devotee of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "it is better that prostitutes be available in the market place so that the sanctity of society can be maintained."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's view that prostitutes are a necessary part of society, comparing it to the government allowing wine shops, but emphasizes that this doesn't mean it is encouraged.

So it is understood here which Srila Prabhupada further explains that even in those days about 5000 years ago there were prostitutes in a city like Dwaraka where Lord Krishna resided. So Srila Prabhupada explains this means that prostitutes are necessary citizens, citizens, they are also part of the society, city, they are necessary for a proper upkeep of society. What is the meaning of this? Prabhupada gives an example to help us understand. The government opens wine shops but this does not mean that the government encourages the drinking of wine. So why should government open wine shops? The idea is that there is a class of men who will drink at any cost and it has been experienced that prohibition in great cities encourage illicit smuggling of wine. Similarly men who are not satisfied at home require such concessions and if there is no prostitute then such low class men will induce others into prostitution. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says it is better that prostitutes be available in the market place so that the sanctity of society can be maintained. The chaste women are never disturbed or bothered by these low class men who are not satisfied at home with their properly wedded wife. It is better to maintain a class of prostitutes than to encourage prostitutes within society.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the real reformation is to encourage everyone to become devotees of Krishna, which will purify them of sinful habits and tendencies.

The real reformation now here is the very most important point in this entire purport. Prabhupada says the real reformation that is required is to enlighten all people to become devotees of the Lord and that will check all kinds of deteriorating factors of life. If somebody is having some sinful habit how can they become free from this sinful habit? Not simply by abstinence but by taking to devotional service. By taking to devotional service any sinful person can become completely purified of the sinful tendencies, sinful habit and can become a first class purified devotee of Krishna. Why? Because originally every one of us is a devotee of Krishna only. That's our original position. But in contact with material nature under a misunderstanding that I am this body or I belong to this material world or I want to enjoy materially I am awarded a material body in contact with material nature. And that's how I develop material desires and those material desires lead to so many sinful activities when somebody does not endeavor to satisfy the material desires by dharma, by laws of dharma. So violating the laws of dharma is sin, is papa.

**Key Quote:** "your attraction for the flesh and bone of an insignificant woman would be properly utilized if this same attraction could be diverted to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker shares the story of Bilvamangal Thakur, who was overly attached to a prostitute named Chintamani, who then instructed him to divert his attraction to Krishna, leading him to become a great devotee.

So even those who are sinful can be reformed, can be rectified by their taking to devotional service. Now Srila Prabhupada gives a very nice example of another great Acharya, Srila Bilvamangal Thakur, a great Acharya of the Vishnu Swami Vaishnava sect in his householder life was overly attached to a prostitute who happened to be a devotee of the Lord. Bilvamangal Thakur in his household life he was attached to a prostitute who was a devotee. One night when this Bilvamangal Thakur in his Purvashram before he became a devotee himself, Acharya, in his householder life he came to the house of this prostitute Chintamani one night when there were torrents of rain and there was a thunderstorm. So Chintamani was astonished to see how this Bilvamangal came on such a dreadful night after crossing a foaming river full of waves at the risk of his life he came so she said to Bilvamangal that your attraction for the flesh and bone of an insignificant woman would be properly utilized if this same attraction could be diverted to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord Krishna to achieve attraction for the transcendental beauty of Lord Krishna. This was a momentous hour for Bilvamangal and he took a turn towards spiritual realization by the words of a prostitute. Later on Bilvamangal Thakur accepted the prostitute as his spiritual master and in several places of his literary works he has glorified the Lord Krishna in the form of the name of Chintamani who showed him the right path. You see? So, this is an instance of a prostitute who is a devotee instructing somebody to become a devotee of Krishna acting as the guide.

**Key Quote:** "even the low-born chandalas and those who are born in family of unbelievers and even the prostitutes shall attain perfection of life if they take shelter of unalloyed devotional service to me."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize that even those of low birth or occupation can attain perfection through devotional service to Krishna, and that the path is open to everyone under proper guidance.

So, therefore, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita in the ninth chapter thirty-second verse even the low-born chandalas and those who are born in family of unbelievers and even the prostitutes shall attain perfection of life if they take shelter of unalloyed devotional service to me. That means Krishna is telling Arjuna if they take shelter of unalloyed devotional service to Krishna because in the path of devotional service there are no impediments due to degraded birth and degraded occupation. The path is open for everyone who agrees to follow this path under proper guidance. So, therefore, it is described here the prostitutes of Dwarka they were all unalloyed devotees of Krishna. They were very eager to meet Krishna as much as all the other devotees were eager and they were already on the path of liberation as described in the Bhagavad Gita. So, therefore, the only reformation in society that is necessary is to make organized effort to turn everyone to become a devotee of Krishna and in this way there will be no anomalies in society.

So among the citizens there were these expert dramatists, artists, singers, historians, all of them. So Prabhupada explains in the purport, it appears that 5000 years ago the society also needed the services of dramatists, artists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists, public speakers, etc. Dances, singers and dramatic artists of Dwaraka mostly hailed from the base at the state complaints of Suthra community, whereas the learned historians and public speakers hailed from the brahmana community that they belonged to a particular caste and were so trained among their families.

that's the way the whole society becomes spiritualized now Srila Prabhupada explains very importantly we should understand that these descriptions of the Lord's superhuman activities in different ages and millenniums were not necessarily arranged in chronological order all the Puranas are historical facts described only in relation with the Supreme Lord in different ages and times as well as on different planets also we do not find any chronological order in these descriptions in the Puranas the modern historians therefore cannot catch up the link and thus they unauthoritatively remark that the Puranas are all imaginary stories only you see just because it is not chronologically arranged or because it is describing events of the Supreme Lord which are extraordinary beyond conception of the human being of the modern day so they say all these stories in the Puranas are all fiction imaginary stories that's what they dismiss they have coined a term called mythology mythology means it is derived from the word myth myth means something which is not a fact it is not true but the truth is that all the stories in the Puranas are factual historical narrations so Prabhupada says further in the Puranas even 100 years ago in India all dramatic performances was centered around the superhuman activities of the Supreme Lord I remember when I was a primary school student one of the famous cinemas was the Sampoorna Ramayan and all of you are aware that Sampoorna Ramayan at the time also head fiquei And all of you are aware that on the TV serial there was this Mahabharata, it was very nicely

**Key Quote:** "They are educated by simply participating in hearing the wonderful descriptions of Krishna's pastimes by these dramaturgs."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how traditional performances centered around Krishna's activities served as a means of imparting Vedic knowledge to the common people, even those without formal education.

produced by famous TV program producers and it was a very popular and super hit program. So about 100 years back there used to be only performances whether it is drama or dance or any art form including cinema and theater simply centered around the super human activities of the Supreme Lord Krishna. The common people would be very entertained by the performance of dramas and yatra parties who played wonderfully on the super human activities of the Lord. And thus even the illiterate agriculturist would be a participant in knowledge of Vedic literature despite a considerable lack of academic qualifications. So many people in the villages they will be engaged in some simple occupation like potters, carpenters. The labourers in the agricultural field, they don't go to a Guru Kho to study the Vedas formally. But that does not mean they are ignorant about the Vedic knowledge. They are educated by simply participating in hearing the wonderful descriptions of Krishna's pastimes by these dramaturgs, by the historians, by the reciters of the Puranas, by the singers. In this way, they also become enlightened in Vedic knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Expert players in drama, dance, singing and speaking are required for the spiritual enlightenment of the common man."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of Puranas as part of Vedic literature and highlights the role of drama, dance, and singing in achieving spiritual enlightenment for the common person.

Therefore, among Vaishnavas, the Puranas are counted among the Vedic literature, because the Puranas are just describing everything in connection with Krishna. So, Puranas are not outside the scope of the Vedas. The Mayavadis, they reject the Puranas as not belonging to the original Vedas. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport here, Therefore, expert players in drama, dance, singing and speaking are required for the spiritual enlightenment of the common man. For the enlightenment of the common man, there is no need to endeavor to give them formal education. Simply by performing drama or having a dance performance centered around the wonderful pastimes of Lord Krishna and his incarnations and his pure devotees activities, the common people get enlightened in this spiritual subject matter.

#### Spiritualizing society, Mundane entertainment vs. Krishna-centered performances, Attractiveness of Krishna's pastimes

**Key Quote:** "The narrations of Krishna's pastimes are extraordinary activities which will interest any person."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts mundane entertainment with Krishna-centered performances, emphasizing the latter's ability to spiritualize society and the inherent attractiveness of Krishna's pastimes.

So, this is the way of spiritualizing society. Instead of having some dance performance which is not connected with Krishna consciousness, which may entertain people, but it doesn't help to spiritualize people's consciousness. So, nowadays the cinema and even the dance performances, ball dance and rock and roll dance and all kinds of music and cinema and all that, centered around some mundane subject matter or mundane fiction, novel. That's all actually not at all spiritually beneficial. Neither is it able to educate the common people. So, whereas the performance of drama, dance and the narration of the historical narrations centered around the superhuman activities of Krishna, or his incarnations or his pure devotees, that will enlighten the common people and simultaneously it will be entertaining for them also. Because the narrations of Krishna's pastimes are extraordinary activities which will interest any person. There is so much of heroic deeds performed by Krishna in displaying his pastimes when he appears in this world.

#### Krishna's heroic deeds, Actual fights vs. staged fights, Krishna's mercy, Purification through hearing Krishna's activities

**Key Quote:** "Simply by hearing such activities, anyone can become spiritualized in their consciousness."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on Krishna's heroic deeds and actual fights against demons, contrasting them with staged performances and highlighting the purifying effect of hearing about Krishna's activities.

And these are factual. Krishna comes to subdue the asuras when the asuras give unnecessary trouble to Krishna's devotees. So, Krishna actually engages in such a fight against the asuras. But the descriptions in the Puranas about Krishna's superhuman activities are very, very attractive. Instead of watching some cinema where some so-called hero engages in some so-called fighting with some villain, which is not really true because the hero doesn't have the strength to fight against the villain. It is simply a show of fighting. Whereas when the Supreme Lord comes to this material world, incarnates in this material world, he actually subdues these asuras who become powerful and harass the ordinary citizens. So, it is an actual fight. It is not a show, merely a show. Krishna fighting against Kamsa or Krishna fighting against the different demons. Bakasura and Gurdabhasura. All these demons who appeared. Vatsasura. Krishna actually killed them. And of course, Krishna's killing is also beneficial for these asuras because they are purified and they are delivered from suffering in hell. They are delivered. Because they go on committing sinful activities. So, it is Krishna's mercy. So, these descriptions, the wonderful activities of Krishna described in the Puranas, are worth hearing because simply by hearing such activities, anyone can become spiritualized in their consciousness. They can become purified. They can become enlightened. Spiritually enlightened.

**Key Quote:** "Material education is useless as regards ultimate liberation."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the uselessness of material education for spiritual liberation and advocating for the encouragement of Krishna-centered performances in society for the benefit of all.

And that's the only thing that's required for a human being to achieve all perfection. In fact, material education is useless. As regards ultimate liberation, it may be helpful for the sake of earning a livelihood. May be helpful. But as far as spiritual enlightenment is concerned, material subject matter is useless. Studying material subject matter is useless. So, therefore, such performances by the dramatists, by the singers, which is centered around Krishna's superhuman activities, are spiritually beneficial for everyone. All class of people. And therefore, such things should be encouraged in society. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Reciprocation, Pure Devotion, Impersonalism

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He satisfies everyone in terms of one's development of spiritual consciousness."
**Summary:** The lecture begins by explaining how Lord Krishna reciprocates with different types of devotees and admirers, contrasting this with the impersonalists' view of the Absolute Truth.

In this session we will be discussing from the 21st and the 22nd verses of the 11th chapter of 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Bhagavam Stratra Bandhunam Pauranam Anuvartinam Yathavidhi Upasangamya Sarvesham Manam Adadhe. The meaning of this 25th chapter: Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead, approached them and offered due honor and respect to each and every one of the friends, relatives, citizens, and all others who came to receive and welcome him. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The Supreme Lord, personality of Godhead, is neither impure nor pure. He is neither impersonal nor an inert object unable to reciprocate the feelings of his devotees. Here the word Yathavidhi, or just as it behooves, is significant. He reciprocates just as it behooves with his different types of admirers and devotees. Of course the pure devotees are of one type only, because they have no other object for service but the Lord. And therefore the Lord also reciprocates with such pure devotees just as it behooves. Namely, he is always attentive to all the matters of his pure devotees. There are others who designate him as impersonal. And so, the Lord also does not take any personal interest. He satisfies everyone in terms of one's development of spiritual consciousness. And a sample of such reciprocation is exhibited here with his different welcomers."

**Key Quote:** "So when he is the absolute controller, how can that energy which he absolutely controls put him in illusion? That's never possible."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the nature of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person with transcendental qualities, contrasting this with the impersonalists' misunderstanding of Krishna's incarnations and emphasizing that the Lord is always liberated.

So, for this explanation we should have the background understanding that the Absolute Truth is ultimately realized as the personality of Godhead, the Supreme Person. And he is having transcendental form, transcendental qualities, transcendental feelings, transcendental activities. Whereas the impersonalists, they refuse to even consider the scriptural description of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person. They also wrongly think that when the Supreme Lord incarnates in this world, they think that his form is material, his feelings are material, his personality is material, his personal qualities are all material qualities. And they make the mistake of considering him to be one of the conditioned souls. Whereas the fact is that the Lord is always liberated because it is his energy which conditions everyone else in this material world. So when he is the absolute controller, how can that energy which he absolutely controls put him in illusion? That's never possible. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says that he is neither impersonal nor an inert object unable to reciprocate feelings. And of course his devotees are situated in a proper relationship with him, person to person relationship. And he accommodates all varieties of relationships. He is unlimited personality. He can and he does accommodate all devotees' relationships. Because he is unlimited, he has unlimited devotees. He has unlimited relationships. That's his nature of his personality.

**Key Quote:** "Nobody was ignored, nobody was considered too insignificant for the Lord to give his attention."
**Summary:** The lecture moves to the 22nd verse, explaining how Krishna greeted everyone present, regardless of their social standing, highlighting his unlimited power and personal reciprocation with each devotee.

And in the next verse, the 22nd verse: prahvabhi vadanashklesha karasparsya smitekshanaihi asvasya ca asvapakebhyo varais caabhi matair vibhuhu. How did Krishna reciprocate with the different people? That's being explained in this verse. The meaning of this 22nd verse: The Almighty Lord greeted everyone present by bowing his head, exchanging greetings, embracing, shaking hands, looking and smiling, giving assurances and awarding benedictions even to the lowest in rank, asvapakebhyo. In the Purport Shri Laha Prabhupada explains, "To receive the Lord Shri Krishna, there were all grades of population, beginning from Vasudeva, Ugrasena, and Gargamuni, all elders. The father, Vasudeva is the father, Ugrasena is the grandfather, Gargamuni is the teacher, the acharya. Down to the prostitutes and chandalas, already been described in the previous verse, even prostitutes came to receive the Lord, because they are also his devotees. Chandalas, they are accustomed to eat dogs, such chandalas also came to receive the Lord, because they are also his devotees. And every one of them was properly greeted by the Lord in terms of rank and position. Exactly according to their position, the Lord greeted them. Nobody was ignored, nobody was considered too insignificant for the Lord to give his attention."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So that is not the position of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He has unlimited power, he is an unlimited personality."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts Krishna's unlimited capacity to reciprocate with everyone to the limited capacity of worldly people, emphasizing that all living entities are eternally related to Krishna as His parts and parcels.

Such a consideration may be there for a person of this world who is limited, let's say a big man in our usual dealings in this world. He may be having so many people with whom he may have to interact. But if there are many people with whom he has to interact, he will give his attention only to the top people, the most intimate people, or the important people. He will not give attention, he cannot give attention to everyone. So that is not the position of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He has unlimited power, he is an unlimited personality. So he expands and he reciprocates with each and every one of his devotees personally, but it is exactly according to their specific relationship. So Srila Prabhupada explains here the truth about all the living entities. As pure living entities, all are the separated parts and parcels of the Lord. Every living being, countless living beings, everyone is part and parcel of Krishna. mamayivamsho jivaloke jivabhuta-sanatana. Eternally related, eternally connected. And thus, no one is alien by his eternal relation. No one is alien, no one is unknown, no one is new to the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "But the Lord is equally affectionate to all his parts and parcels despite material gradation."
**Summary:** The lecture explains why there are gradations among living entities despite being part and parcel of Krishna, attributing it to different levels of material contamination, and emphasizes Krishna's equal affection for all, highlighting His descent to recall them back to His kingdom.

Such pure living entities are graded differently. Why this gradation if all are pure living entities, all are part and parcel of Krishna? Why the gradation? Because they are graded differently because they have different contamination of the modes of material nature. Different degrees of contamination, different combinations of the contamination of sattva guna, rajya guna, tamo guna, according to their previous association with the material nature itself. But the Lord is equally affectionate to all his parts and parcels despite material gradation. According to contamination, there are grades of people in this world. But the Lord is equally affectionate to everyone. That's the truth about the relationship of each one of us with the Supreme Lord. He descends only to recall these materialistic living beings back to his kingdom. Why does he come? He comes to recall, "Come back to me. Please come to me. You are mine. You are my part and parcel. You belong to me." He says this in the Bhagavad Gita: sarva bhutani asheshani drakshasi atmani ato mayi. They are all in me. They belong to me. They are mine. Very, very clearly Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita in the fourth chapter, thirty-fifth verse. So, Prabhupada says further, "Intelligent persons take advantage of this facility offered by the Personality of Godhead to all living beings." When he comes to recall, intelligent persons will accept this call of the Lord and they will follow the Lord's directions, how they can be reinstated in their original position in the spiritual kingdom of God. So, Srila Prabhupada further says, "No one is rejected by the Lord from the kingdom of God and it remains with the living being to accept this or not."

**Key Quote:** "Living being has free will and the Lord never forces himself upon anyone that you must come now."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the free will of the living being to accept or reject Krishna's invitation to return to Krishnaloka, reminding the audience of the miseries of material existence and encouraging them to prepare themselves to return to the spiritual kingdom.

You should always remember we have a tiny amount of free will and that's a characteristic of living being. Living being has free will and the Lord never forces himself upon anyone that you must come now. If you don't want to go to Krishnaloka, you can remain here. But remember that this is not your proper situation. This place is filled with miseries and you have to suffer miseries due to your material existence. So, put an end to these miseries, prepare yourself and go to Krishnaloka as Krishna invites and Krishna directs and Krishna instructs in the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

#### Vedic culture, role of Brahmanas, glorification of the Lord

**Verse References:** SB 1.11.23
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is the glorifiers, the brahmanas, who become themselves glorified by glorifying Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the Vedic culture where Brahmanas offer free service and glorify the king, and how glorifying Krishna benefits the glorifier.

In this session, we will be discussing the 23rd and 24th verses of the 11th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. 23rd verse: स्वयं च गुरुभिर विप्रै सदारै स्थविरैर अपी आशिर्भिर युज्यमानोन्यैर वन्दिभिष्चाविषत्पुरं. The meaning of this 23rd verse: Then the Lord personally entered the city accompanied by elderly relatives and invalid brahmanas with their wives, all offering benedictions and singing the glories of the Lord. Others also praised the glories of the Lord. So, Srila Prabhupada comments on this particular verse in the purport as follows: "The brahmanas in society were never attentive to banking money for future retired life. This is the Vedic culture. The brahmanas always offer free service and even if they get excess of some charity, they spend it off in devotional service. They don't keep money for future. When they were old invalids, they used to approach the assembly of the kings and simply by praising the glorious deeds performed by the kings along with their wives, they would be provided with all necessities of life. What a wonderful society. When they require, they just go and ask the king, and the king will provide. Such brahmanas were not, so to speak, flatterers of the kings, but the kings were actually glorified by their actions." See, they are not doing this just to get some benefit. They are factually glorifying the king for his factual glorious qualities. And here, they are glorifying the supreme king of all kings, the supreme lord, Krishna, who is full of all wonderful qualities. So, the kings, Srila Prabhupada says, were sincerely still more encouraged in pious acts by such brahmanas in a dignified way. The brahmanas would glorify the kings for their good qualities. The kings would also feel encouraged. They would also feel enthused, inspired to do more of such pious activities. In a dignified way, the brahmanas would glorify the king. Lord Sri Krishna is worthy of all glories, and the praying brahmanas and others would glorify themselves by chanting the glories of the lord. In the case of glorification of Krishna, it is not Krishna who is actually in need of the glorification.

#### Archa-vigraha, Deity worship, Transcendental form of the Lord

**Key Quote:** "The transcendental form of the lord installed in a temple is not different from the lord personally."
**Summary:** This segment explains the significance of the Archa-vigraha, the deity form of the Lord, and how it is not different from the Lord himself, being expanded by His internal potency.

The 24th verse: Rāja mārgaṁ gate kṛṣṇae dvārakāyā kulaś triyaḥ harmyāṇi āruruhur vipraḥ tad īkṣana mahotsavāḥ. The meaning of this 24th verse: When Lord Krishna passed over the public roads, all the ladies from the respectable families of Dvārakā, kulaś triyaḥ, went up to the roofs of their palaces just to have a look at the lord. They considered this to be the greatest festival. So Śrīla Prabhupāda elaborately explains this in the purport: "To have a look at the lord is a great festive occasion, undoubtedly, as it was considered by the metropolitan ladies of Dvārakā. This is still followed by the devout ladies of India. Especially during the days of the jhūlan and janmashtami ceremonies, the ladies of India still throng up, in the greatest number, at the temple of the lord, where his transcendental eternal form is worshipped. The transcendental form of the lord installed in a temple is not different from the lord personally. Such a form of the lord is called archa-vigraha, or archa-incarnation, and is expanded by the lord by his internal potency, just to facilitate the devotional service of his innumerable devotees who are in the material world. The material senses cannot perceive the spiritual nature of the lord, and therefore the lord accepts the archa-vigraha, which is apparently made of material elements like earth, wood and stone, but actually there is no material contamination."

**Key Quote:** "Even though he appears in a material statue, actually he is not contaminated by matter."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the concept that although the Archa-vigraha appears to be made of material elements, it is completely spiritual and not contaminated by matter because the Lord is transcendental.

So, Śrīla Prabhupāda is comparing that when Kṛṣṇa incarnated, He was received by the ladies of Dvārakā by them going on top of the roofs, and just having the darshan of the lord was like a festival for their eyes, because the lord is very, very, very, very beautiful. And the same facility is available even now in the form of the lord being worshipped in the temple, where he is beautifully decorated, ornamented, and cared for by his devotees. So, this archa-incarnation, worshipable deity form, is not different from the lord personally. It is not an imaginary form, it is not a dead statue. It is actually expanded by the lord's spiritual potency, and it facilitates the devotional service of the devotees. Further, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, the material senses cannot perceive the spiritual nature of the lord. Therefore, the lord accepts the archa-vigraha, which is apparently made of material elements like earth, wood and stone. See, the archa-incarnation is made of material elements, but that doesn't mean it is a material statue. No. Why? Because the lord is Kaivalya, one alone. There is no matter in him. He is one without a second, and therefore, the almighty lord can appear in any form without being contaminated by the material conception. So when the lord appears in the archa form, he is appearing in his transcendental forms, completely spiritual form. Even though he appears in a material statue, actually he is not contaminated by matter. He is completely spiritual, and his appearance is also completely transcendental. This is difficult to understand for ordinary people, but this is being explained by the āchārya. This is explained in the scriptures.

#### Spiritual transformation, Deity worship, Festivals

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "There is a spiritual transformation of their consciousness."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the spiritual benefits of having darshan of the Archa-incarnation, leading to a transformation of the heart and consciousness, and compares temple festivals to the festive atmosphere during the Lord's incarnation in Dvārakā.

And it is a fact that those devotees who have darshan of the archa-incarnation of the lord are deriving spiritual benefit simply by having darshan. Their heart becomes cleansed. There is a transformation of their heart. There is a transformation of their consciousness. There is a spiritual transformation of their consciousness. So that is proof that they are not having darshan of a material form. This has to be very carefully understood. If the form were material, there would have been no spiritual transformation by seeing a material form. Whereas, the proof that devotees have darshan of the archa-incarnation resulting in spiritual transformation of the heart means that the form they are seeing is completely spiritual, and therefore, the transformation is taking place. So, Śrīla Prabhupāda further explains, festivities in the temple of the lord as held generally are like festivals performed during the manifestive days of the lord of Dvārakā, about 5000 years ago. So, when the lord would enter Dvārakā, it was a festival for all the inhabitants of Dvārakā. The lord has appeared, the lord has come back, returned to the city. Same way, the lord's appearance is celebrated as Janmashtami festival or Julan festival on certain occasions like the spring festival, the autumn festival. All these are actually the same type of festive atmosphere which was actually present 5000 years back.

**Key Quote:** "Deity is the factual presence of the lord in his transcendental form. Idol is an imaginary form, a material form, which is imagined to be something like God."
**Summary:** This segment explains that only authorized Acharyas can install deities, inviting the Lord to reside in the Archa-vigraha, and distinguishes between a deity (factual presence of the Lord) and an idol (imaginary form).

The authorized āchāryas who know the science perfectly install such temples of the lord under regulated principles just to offer facilities to the common man. The āchāryas are installing the deities. Ordinary people cannot install deities on their own. It's only the āchāryas who invite the lord to come and reside in the archa-vigraha and accept the worship of the devotees. Because the lord is intimately connected, related with the āchārya, so the āchārya can invite and the lord does accept the invitation of the āchārya to facilitate common people. For the common people's spiritual benefit, the lord accepts the invitation of the āchārya and comes and resides in the archa-form, the archa-incarnation. There are persons who are less intelligent, who, without being conversant with the signs of devotional service, mistake this great attempt to be idol worship. There are materialistic people, impersonalists, and all kinds of demons who call this worship of the deity as idol worship. So Prabhupāda makes a clear distinction between deity and idol. Deity is the factual presence of the lord in his transcendental form. Idol is an imaginary form, a material form, which is imagined to be something like God. So idol is different, deity is different. So these materialistic people, the demons, the impersonalists, they think that devotees are worshipping an idol. They poke their nose into that to which they have no access. The impersonalists, the materialists, the demons,

have no access to the transcendental reality of the Supreme Lord because they deny, they criticize. So therefore, they have no access. So only devotees can understand this. Devotees can access. Devotees can worship. Devotees can benefit spiritually by such worship, by such darshan. And the benefit, the result is seen in the heart transformation. In second canto, second chapter, there is a description that devotional service, transformation of the heart, change of heart. So that is the proof of that form of the Lord being completely transcendent. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 25th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam: Nithyam Nireeksha Mananam Yadapi Dvarakaukasam Na Vitrupyantihi Drushaha Shriyo Dhamangam Achyutam. The meaning of this verse is, "The inhabitants of Dvaraka were regularly accustomed to look upon the results of the Dvaraka Reservoir of all beauty, the infallible Lord. Yet they were never satiated, Na Vitrupyantihi. They were never satiated." What is the meaning of satiation? Satiation means upon repeatedly doing something, one becomes completely satisfied so that there is no more possibility of being further, taking further satisfaction. One becomes saturated, that's the word in English. Satiation has got another word, saturation.

**Key Quote:** "There is a certain point of saturation or satiation where no more they can eat and relish that sweet"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of adding salt to water and eating sweets to illustrate the concept of satiation in the material world.

Just like if you take a glass of water and you keep adding salt, then this salt becomes dissolved. But if you keep adding more and more salt, a certain point of saturation comes where no more salt will dissolve in that water, in the saline solution, in the salt solution. No more it will dissolve because it is saturated. Similarly, when somebody, let us say, eats a piece of sweet, then they may take a small piece and they taste it, oh it's very nice. Let me have a little more. So they have one more piece of the sweet and then they feel even more satisfied. Then one more piece, one more piece. How many pieces can they keep eating? There is a certain point of saturation or satiation where no more they can eat and relish that sweet. In fact, it becomes nausea. That means they feel like no more even looking at that sweet. So that is the point of saturation.

**Key Quote:** "Anything material seen for a number of times ultimately becomes unattractive by the law of satiation"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that unlike material beauty, the beauty of the Lord never leads to satiation, as experienced by the residents of Dwarka.

The inhabitants of Dwarka, even though they are accustomed to seeing the most beautiful form of the Lord, they never felt saturated. They never thought we have seen enough. They never felt like that. So it is explained by Prabhupada in the purport, "When the ladies of the city of Dwarka got up on the roofs of their palaces, they never thought that they had previously many times seen the beautiful body of the infallible Lord." They never thought like that, "We have seen it enough number of times," though they had actually seen many many many times before. This indicates that they had no satiation in desiring to see the Lord. Anything material seen for a number of times ultimately becomes unattractive by the law of satiation. We have experience in this material world. If we repeatedly see something beautiful, we become saturated, we become satiated. We cannot see it anymore. It is no longer attractive. It becomes unattractive after saturation, point of saturation. That is true for all material beauty. The law of satiation acts materially.

**Key Quote:** "In the case of spiritual beauty, there is no satiation. There is no saturation. Never."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the Lord's infallibility and contrasts it with the fallible nature of living entities who become covered by material bodies and lose their spiritual identity.

In the case of spiritual beauty, there is no satiation. There is no saturation, never. The word infallible is significant here because although the Lord has mercifully descended on earth, He is still infallible. Infallible means He never falls down to the material platform. We, on the other hand, we fall down to the material platform when we come to the material world. When we come in contact with the gunas, material nature, we become conditioned. We fall down to the material platform. From the spiritual platform, we fall down to the material platform. So Prabhupada says, "The Lord does not become fallen, whereas the living entities are fallible." Fallible means they are prone to fall down because when they come in contact with the material world, they lack their spiritual identity. What happens to our spiritual identity? We are all spirit souls. What happens to it? It becomes covered by the material body. And thus, the body materially obtained becomes subjected to birth, growth, transformation, situation, deterioration, annihilation under the laws of nature. Our spiritual beauty is covered.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord's body is not like that. He descends as he is and is never under the laws of material modes"
**Summary:** The speaker describes the deterioration of the material body with age and disease, contrasting it with the eternal and uncontaminated nature of the Lord's spiritual form.

And the material form, however nice it may look when one is young, as the body ages or as the body changes, as the body becomes diseased or old or invalid or wrinkled, then the body is no longer beautiful. The body is no longer beautiful. When a person becomes dirty due to sweating, then until the person takes a good bath, will not appear beautiful, will not appear fresh, you see. The Lord's body is not like that. He descends as He is and is never under the laws of material modes. Spiritual form never deteriorates, never becomes dirty. There is no possibility of material contamination. And in the case of the Lord, there is no possibility of material covering. This material covering applies only to living entities.

**Key Quote:** "This material covering applies only to living entities who are desirous of material enjoyment"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the material covering applies only to those who desire material enjoyment, and that the Lord's body is the source of all beauty and everything that exists.

Who are desirous of material enjoyment, who are desirous of materially lording over material nature. Only to such living entities the spiritual form gets covered by a material covering and that material covering is strictly according to the material laws, subject to deterioration. It cannot remain the same. It never remains the same. Anything material has to deteriorate with time, with color. The Supreme Lord's body is the source of everything that be. Aham sarvasya prabhavo, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, "I am the source of everything, Janmadyasya yatha." The Supreme Lord is the ultimate source of everything. In the Vedanta Sutra also, it is explained. Bhagavad Gita also explains this. Bhagavatam also explains this. The opening verse of the Bhagavatam says, Janmadyasya yatha Anvayati tarthas Krishna Vasudeva. The son of Vasudeva, the divine son of Vasudeva and Devaki, is actually the ultimate source of everything. So the Supreme Lord's form or body is the source of everything that be. It is the reservoir of all beauties.

**Key Quote:** "If at all we have spiritual eyes to see, then we cannot say we have seen enough. Never."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the limitations of material vision and the ever-fresh nature of the Lord's transcendental form, emphasizing that the Lord's name, form, qualities, and entourage are all spiritual manifestations.

We cannot have sufficient experience of seeing the Lord's transcendental form. If at all we have spiritual eyes to see, then we cannot say we have seen enough, never. No one therefore is satiated by seeing the transcendental body of the Lord because they are, there are always manifestations of newer and newer beauties. This is the nature of the Lord's form, ever fresh. In the Brahma Samhita, nava yauva namcha, ever fresh youthful beauty is the nature of the Lord's transcendental form. So the Lord's transcendental form is the nature of the Lord's transcendental form. So never compare the Lord's form with any material form. Never consider the Lord's form to be material. It may appear like a material form, but it is not a material form. So therefore Srila Prabhupada concludes this purport by telling that transcendental name, form, qualities, entourage, etc., are all spiritual manifestations. When the Lord descends to this material world, incarnates, He incarnates in His transcendental form with transcendental name, transcendental qualities, His spiritual entourage, His associates were all completely spiritual beings.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra and emphasizes that there is no satiation in chanting the Lord's holy name because it is full of nectar.

In spiritual form, but they look like ordinary people, but they are not ordinary people. They are all spiritual manifestations of the Lord. In this material world, there is no satiation in chanting the holy name of the Lord. We keep chanting Hare Krishna Mantra everyday because it is a spiritual sound vibration. There is no satiation in chanting the holy name of the Lord. We are not yet bored chanting the same mantra, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. Everyday we chant minimum of 1728 times this mantra, 16 rounds. And liberated souls, pure devotees like Haridasa Thakur, they chant 1 lakh names of the Lord everyday, 3 lakh names, about 22 hours in a cycle of 24 hours they chant. Why? Because it is full of nectar, namamrutam. It is full of nectar and unlimited supply of nectar is there when one keeps chanting, chanting, chanting, chanting. Of course, the chanting has to be done purely to taste that nectar of the holy name, namamrutam.

It is there. It is there in the holy name, in the transcendental vibration. There is no satiation in discussing the qualities of the Lord. The Lord has unlimited qualities by which He attracts everyone. This is described in the Atmarama verse of the Srimad Bhagavatam, 1st canto, 7th chapter, Atmarama verse: Atmarama Shchamunayo Nirgrantha Api Urukrame Kurvanti Ahitukim Bhaktim Itthambhuta Gunoharihi. Itthambhuta means it is full of attractive qualities, attracts everybody. So devotees who discuss these wonderful qualities of the Lord, they are never tired. Machchitta Madgata Parasparam Katayan Taschamam Nithyam. They are always discussing about the wonderful qualities of the Lord and they derive great satisfaction and happiness, Tushyanticha Ramanticha. That is the nature of the Lord's personality, His qualities. There is no limitation to the entourage of the Lord. He appears with His associates and He has so many associates, so many. He is the unlimited Lord. He is the unlimited associates.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet.

His moon-like face is the drinking vessel of the moon for eyes which hanker after all that is beautiful. His arms are the resting places for the administrative demigods, and his lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees who never talk or sing of any subject except his lordship. So systematically the description is being given of the chest of the Lord, the moon-like face, his arms, and his lotus feet: Yasya Uraha, then Mukham, then Bahavaha, and Padaambujam.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the meaning of the verse, explaining that the Lord's chest is the abode of the goddess of fortune, his face is the object of beauty for the eyes, his arms provide shelter to the demigods, and his lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees.

So all the four are described very, very nicely in this verse. So the chest is the abode of the goddess of fortune, the goddess of fortune, Nivasa Sriaha Nivasa. So the moon-like face is the drinking vessel for eyes which hanker after all that is beautiful. Our eyes are always searching, seeking something beautiful to look at, but which is the most beautiful object of vision for our eyes? It is the eyes of the Lord. It is the Lord's form, and particularly the Lord's face. And his arms are the resting places for the administrative demigods. So Prabhupada explains in the purport what this means. The Lord gives all protection to the demigods who are engaged in administration of this universe by the Lord's protection to the demigods, by actually giving protection through killing the demons, either directly himself or through his agents, through his empowered devotees. He kills the demons and he protects the devotees, the demigods. Then his lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the pure devotees' devotion to the Lord's lotus feet and references the Brahma Samhita to describe the transcendental abode of the Lord, filled with desire trees and Surabhi cows.

So the lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees. The pure devotees always take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, and they always do discuss about the Supreme Lord. Their only topic of discussion is the Supreme Lord. So the purport, Shila Prabhupada explains, there are different classes of human beings all with different enjoyment from different objects to seek new pleasures than обс cartridges. There are persons who are seeking after the favour of the goddess of fortune, and for them, the Vedic literatures give information that the Lord is always served with all reverence by thousands and thousands of the goddesses of fortune at the Chintamani Dhamma. This is the verse in the Brahma Samhita, Chintamani prakara sadmasu kalpa vriksha lakshavrteshu surabhi rabhi palayantam, lakshmi sahasra shata sambhrama sevya manam. Lakshmi refers to the goddess of fortune, sahasra shata, hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune are serving him with great reverence, sambhrama sevya manam. So if you want to know more about the goddess of fortune, you can click on the link in the description below. This description is there in the Brahma Samhita, the transcendental abode of the Lord where the trees are all desired trees and the buildings are made of touchstone, Chintamani prakara sadmasu. The trees are desired trees. They yield all kinds of desires. They satisfy all kinds of desires. The Lord Govinda is engaged there in herding the Surabhi cows as his natural occupation, Surabhi rabhi palayantam lakshavrteshu. He is surrounded by so many cows, beautiful cows, Surabhi cows.

**Key Quote:** "Simply darshan of the Lord's transcendental form means we can simultaneously have darshan of the goddess of fortune because she always resides on the chest of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that seeing the Lord's form allows one to see the goddess of fortune and contrasts this with the impersonalists' inability to perceive the Lord's form; he also suggests that artists should focus on the Lord's beautiful face for complete satisfaction.

And they yield so much milk, oceans of milk. These goddesses of fortune can be saved. They are seen automatically if we are attracted by the bodily features of the Lord. There is no need to separately endeavour to have darshan of the beautiful goddess of fortune. Simply darshan of the Lord's transcendental form means we can simultaneously have darshan of the goddess of fortune because she always resides on the chest of the Lord. Now, Srila Prabhupada makes a remark about the goddess of fortune. He says, the impersonalists cannot observe such goddesses of fortune. Why? Because of their dry speculative habit. So, the speculation leads them to conclude that absolute truth is impersonal, no form, no personality. This is their conclusion. So, when they cannot see the form of the Lord, they can neither see the form of the goddess of fortune. Because she always resides on the chest of the Lord. Now, there are artists who are overtaken by the beautiful creation, this material creation. Prabhupada said, they should better see to the beautiful face of the Lord for complete satisfaction. Artists want to paint something very beautiful. They admire the creation, but millions and billions of times more beautiful is the beautiful face of the Lord. Of course, the creation has got beauty, no doubt about it, but that's just a reflection of the original beauty of the face of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that all beauty in the material world is a reflection of the Lord's beauty and that administrative demigods and devotees can find protection and fearlessness by taking shelter of the Lord's arms.

So whatever beauty we see in this material world is a reflection of the original beauty of the form of the Lord or the face of the Lord. The face of the Lord is the embodiment of beauty. All beauty is there in the face of the Lord. What they call beautiful nature is but a smile. What they call the sweet sounds of the birds are but specimens of the whispering voice of the Lord. See, this is a description in the Bhagavatam second canto about the Lord's beauty and Lord's melodious voice that is manifest in this material world as a reflection. There are administrative demigods in charge of departmental service of cosmic management, and there are tiny administrative gods in the state service. They are always afraid of other competitors. Those in position of power in this material world, they are fearful of competitors who may overtake them. But if such administrative gods or administrative demigods, if they take shelter of the arms of the Lord, the Lord can protect them always from the attacks of enemies. This is always a fact. Pure devotees always take shelter of the Supreme Lord's arms. So pure devotees are never afraid, never afraid. They are called abhaya, nirbhaya. A faithful servant of the Lord engaged in the service of the administration is the ideal executive head

**Key Quote:** "A faithful servant of the Lord engaged in the service of the administration is the ideal executive head and can well protect the interest of the people in general."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts faithful administrators who protect citizens with materialistic administrators who cannot provide real protection and explains that the Lord is the essence of everything, and pure devotees are called sarangas because they glorify him.

and can well protect the interest of the people in general, like Yudhishthira Maharaj, Parichit Maharaj. They were ruling the whole world, but because they had taken protection of the Supreme Lord, they were able to give protection to the citizens. They were able to give proper protection to the citizens. Other so-called administrators are symbols of anachronisms leading to the acute distress of the people who are governed by them. These materialistic administrators, their own life is in danger. What to speak of them giving protection to the citizens they are ruling? It is not possible. They cannot give real protection. They may try, but they are invariably defeated by more powerful persons. That's the nature of this material world. But any administrator can remain safely under the protection of the arms of the Lord. That's what is meant by telling his arms are the resting place for the administrative demigods. The Lord's arms are worthy of taking shelter because they can give protection to anyone and everyone in this material world. So, Prabhupada explains the word saranganam. So Prabhupada says, the essence of everything is the Supreme Lord and therefore he is called saram. Saram is the essence, and those who sing and talk about him are called sarangas, or the pure devotees. The pure devotees are called sarangas because they are always singing and glorifying and talking about the Supreme Lord who is the essence of everything, Sara. So they are called sarangas. The pure devotees are always hankering after the lotus feet of the Lord. Why? Prabhupada explains, the lotus has a kind of honey which is transcendentally relished by the devotees, and the devotees are like bees who are always after the honey of the lotus feet of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees are like bees seeking the honey of the Lord's lotus feet and recites a prayer by Rupa Goswami expressing his desire to be fixed at the Lord's lotus feet to relish transcendental service, concluding with thanks and Hare Krishna.

So, Srila Prabhupada is quoting the great devotee Acharya, Srila Rupa Goswami. He has sung a song about the lotus honey comparing himself to the bee. Srila Rupa Goswami says in this song, O my Lord Krishna, I beg to offer my prayers unto you. My mind is like the bee and it is after some honey. Kindly therefore give my bee mind a place at your lotus feet, which are the resources for all transcendental honey. I know that even big demigods like Brahma do not see the rays of the nails of your lotus feet, even though they are engaged in deep meditation for years and years together. Still, O infallible one, my ambition is such, for you are very merciful to your surrendered devotees. O Madhava, I know also that I have no genuine devotion for the service of your lotus feet, but because your lordship is inconceivably powerful, you can do what is impossible to be done. Your lotus feet can deride even the nectar of the heavenly kingdom and therefore I am very much attracted by them. O Supreme Eternal, please therefore let my mind be fixed at your lotus feet so that eternally I may be able to relish the taste of your transcendental service. This is the beautiful prayer offered by Srila Rupa Goswami, the Acharya in the Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya. So, the devotees are satisfied with being placed at the lotus feet of the Lord because there is a certain honey to be relished by the devotees who take shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

dark cloud was surrounded simultaneously by Sun, moon, lightning and rainbows. The description here is of a very, very, very beautiful scene when Krishna is passing on the public road of Dwaraka being welcomed by somebody holding an umbrella, by shower of flowers, by his yellow garments appearing very, very beautiful, all complementing each other to create a very beautiful scene. So here the comparison is made to a natural phenomena that occurs in a beautiful sky. So Shri la Prabhupada comments in the purport, the Sun, moon, rainbow and lightning do not appear in the sky simultaneously. When there is Sun, the moonlight becomes insignificant, and if there are clouds and a rainbow, there is no manifestation of lightning. These are the natural phenomena that occur in the sky. So how was it possible that all of them are described as simultaneously appearing in the scene? So that is explained here. The Lord's Bodily Hue is just like a new monsoon cloud, he is compared here into the cloud. The white umbrella over his head is compared to the sun, the movement of the bunch hair fan of flukes is compared to the moon, the showers of flowers are compared to the stars, his yellow garments are compared to the rainbow. So all these activities of the firmament, firmament means the sky, being impossible simultaneous factors, cannot be adjusted by comparison. If you try to imagine that the scene was like all these appearing simultaneously, that is never possible as a natural phenomenon. The advantage of the white umbrella over his head is that it can be adjusted by comparison. The advantage of the white umbrella over his head is that it can be adjusted by comparison. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord. The adjustment is possible only when we think of the inconceivable potency of the Lord.

And in His presence, anything impossible can be made possible by His inconceivable energy. So the Lord, by His inconceivable energy, makes the impossible also possible. That's the all-powerful Lord. Supremely powerful. Unlimitedly powerful. Infinitely powerful. It's possible. Everything is possible. But, the situation created at the time of His passing on the roads of Dvārakā was beautiful and could not be compared to anything besides the description of natural phenomena. It's so very beautiful that something comparable for our understanding who are not actually being present at that time, we are hearing the description from the Srimad Bhagavatam as described by the author. Or in this case, as described by Suta Goswami, who is describing to the sages Naimisharanya what was it like when Krishna was received by His devotees and how they were so very enthusiastic and eager and happy to receive the Lord with all wonderful arrangements for the reception of the most beloved personality, at the same time the most exalted personality, most respected personality, and they want to show their affection. Each one of them. Each one of them want to show their affection for Krishna. Because they are all related to Krishna. Everyone. So, the comparison can only be made with a natural phenomenon. And, if you could somehow imagine the natural phenomena occurring simultaneously, the sun, the moon, the rainbow and the lightning in the sky, which is impossible, but by the Lord's inconceivable potency, it's possible.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the limitations of scientific knowledge in understanding the Lord's creation and quotes Vedanta Sutra to emphasize the inconceivable nature of reality.

Then, that scene might appear something like all the four simultaneously coming in the sky. Now, regarding the Lord's inconceivable potency, Srila Prabhupada explains in another place in one lecture delivered while speaking on Bhagavad Gita. Prabhupada says, there are so many things that is not possible even to understand by the modern process of scientific experimental knowledge. The Lord's creation is so very wonderful that if somebody tries to comprehend what is the creation like by their process of scientific experimental knowledge, it is not possible. And, if the creation of the Lord is not possible to be understood by scientific process of knowledge, how can this ever understand God Himself, the source of everything? You cannot even know material objects by your so-called scientific study and research. You can know little more, that's all, by some advancement of your material knowledge. But, you cannot completely understand even this creation, the inferior creation of the Lord. So, Vedanta Sutra advises all of us, achintya khaluye bhava na tam starkena yojoyet This is what the Vedanta Sutra states. Things which are beyond your imagination, beyond your reach, beyond your thoughts, beyond your words, beyond your sense perception, how can you understand them by your experimental so-called scientific research? It's not possible. Therefore, achintya, achintya means inconceivable. We cannot conceive even material things which are created by the Lord.

#### Time scale, Inconceivable nature, Brahmaloka lifespan

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, these are all achintya, beyond our conception."
**Summary:** This segment explains the inconceivable duration of life in Brahmaloka according to the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting the vast difference in time scales and the limitations of human comprehension.

In the Bhagavad Gita, it is said, sahasra yuga pariyantam aharyat brahmano viduhu Prabhupada gives an example for helping us understand what's really inconceivable about this. Brahmanaha means of Lord Brahma and the living creatures in the Brahmaloka, the highest, topmost planet in the entire universe. So in that planet, Brahmaloka planet, the people or living entities who are living there, their duration of life, what is it like? What is their duration of life? The Bhagavad Gita says, sahasra yuga pariyantam Now yuga, the word yuga used here means according to our calculation on the earth, time calculation on the earth. Yuga here means the four yugas combined together. Now, satya yuga means eighteen lakhs of years. Treta yuga, twelve hundred thousands of years. Dwapara yuga, eight hundred thousands of years. And Kali yuga, four hundred thousands of years. So, totally, all these four put together, forty-three hundred thousands of years makes one Divya yuga. And one thousand such Divya yugas that is one day of the inhabitants of Brahmaloka. So can you do the calculation? Can you imagine what is the duration of their day? So they live a hundred years, 100 years according to that calculation of day, such day and night, and 365 such days and nights, 100 such years they live. So, it's just not possible for us to calculate this. What is the duration of life of the people who live in Brahmaloka, the topmost planet in this material universe? So, these are all achintya, beyond our conception. It has been calculated elsewhere, and it is said their lifespan, Brahmaloka lifespan, is something like 4 trillion 30 billion of our solar years. 4 trillion 30 billion. That is their lifespan. And even that is limited. That's limited. That is just half a breadth of Maha Vishnu. That is the lifespan of the inhabitants of Brahmaloka or Lord Brahma. Half a breadth of Maha Vishnu. So, what is Maha Vishnu's time scale? So, we cannot imagine all this. We cannot conceive of all this. Then, what to speak of the spiritual world?

**Key Quote:** "So, the best thing is to follow the process, the Vedic process, to receive knowledge by the descending process."
**Summary:** This segment advocates for receiving knowledge through the descending process (parampara) due to the limitations of the human mind in comprehending the vastness and complexity of the universe.

We cannot calculate even something of the material world perfectly. So, the best thing is to follow the process, the Vedic process, to receive knowledge by the descending process. Descending process means the perfect knowledge is available from the Supreme Lord, coming down in the parampara system. We simply have to receive it. That's all. And for receiving such knowledge, we have to prepare ourselves. And that preparation is nothing but the practice of spiritual life. And it is perfect knowledge handed down. Because by our experimental method, we can't even conceive what is the nature of things in this one universe. There are millions of such universes. Each universe has millions of planets. Each planet has millions of living entities. Each living entity has millions of complicated structures within their form. There are 3 trillion cells within our body. And there are 200 varieties of cells. All this is inconceivable for our tiny brain to accommodate. So, therefore, the descending process. I'll stop here.

#### Lord Krishna's Return to Dwaraka, Respect for Mothers, Family Dynamics

**Key Quote:** "after entering the house of his father he was embraced by the mothers present and the Lord offered his obeisances unto them by placing his head at their feet the mothers were headed by Devaki his real mother"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses to be discussed, focusing on Lord Krishna's return to Dwaraka and his respectful interaction with his father's wives, emphasizing the importance of respecting all mothers.

In this session we will be discussing from two verses, 28 and 29, of the 11th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, the same topic: Lord Krishna's entrance into Dwaraka, how the Dwaraka Nivasis received Lord Krishna when he returned to Dwaraka from Hastinapura. Pravishtastu Griham Pitro Parishvakta Swamatrabhihi Vavande Shirasa Saptah Devaki Pramukha Mudha, the meaning of this verse is: after entering the house of his father, he was embraced by the mothers present, and the Lord offered his obeisances unto them by placing his head at their feet. The mothers were headed by Devaki, his real mother. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Krishna has entered his father's house. Vasudeva was living in a palace. Krishna has entered his father's house. Vasudeva was living in a palace in Dwaraka, and Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krishna, had completely separate residential quarters where he lived with his 18 wives. Kings used to have more than one queen, so Vasudeva was a king and he had 18 queens, so he used to live in separate residential quarters with his 18 queens. Out of them, Srimati Devaki is the real mother of Lord Krishna. Devaki and Vasudeva gave birth to Krishna, but in spite of all this, all other stepmothers were equally affectionate to Lord Krishna, as would be evident from the following verse. So Lord Krishna also did not distinguish his real mother from his stepmothers, and he equally offered his obeisances unto all the wives of Vasudeva present on the occasion.

#### Seven Mothers, Vedic Culture, Respect

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "according to scriptures there are seven mothers Saptaita Matara Smrita"
**Summary:** The lecture expands on the concept of 'seven mothers' in Vedic culture, including the biological mother, the wife of the spiritual master, the wife of a brahmana, the queen, the cow, the nurse, and the earth, highlighting the importance of respect for all in the position of a mother.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in another place that Lord Krishna is teaching us by his example that there are actually seven mothers for everyone, every civilized human being, seven mothers: Atma Mata Guru Patni Brahmani Raja Patnika Dhenur Dhatri Tatha Prithvi Saptaita Matara Smrita, seven mothers according to the Vedic conception. So the meaning of this particular verse that I have just now recited, according to scriptures there are seven mothers, Saptaita Matara Smrita. First one is Atma Mata, the real mother. Guru Patni, the wife of the spiritual master, Guru Patni. Number three, Brahmani, means the wife of a Brahmana. Number four, Raja Patnika, the wife of the king, that means the queen. Then number five, Dhenu, the cow, and number six, Dhatri, means the nurse, and last one, the seventh one, Prithvi, means the earth mother. Earth mother, cow, all of them are mothers, all of them are mothers. This is the Vedic culture, very advanced culture, the highest respect is offered to the mother, but mother is not just one. Our limited understanding is generally we have one mother, but no, there are other mothers, there are other mothers, others in the position of mother. As regards respect, offering respect, from that perspective it is being said here how one should offer respect to one's mother, the same respect should be offered to the others also who are in the position of respect as one's own mother. Hmm, even by this injunction of the Shastras, the seven kinds of mothers, the stepmother who is the wife of the father is also as good as one's own mother, because the father is also one of the spiritual masters. So if the father is spiritual master, and if he has eighteen wives, all the eighteen of them are one's mother, each one of them is mother.

#### Krishna's Example, Imitation vs. Following, Lord Shiva

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Krishna the Lord of the Universe plays the part of an ideal son just to teach others how to treat their stepmothers"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that while Lord Krishna sets an example, not all his activities should be imitated, distinguishing between following and imitating, using the example of Lord Shiva drinking poison to illustrate the dangers of imitation.

So Lord Krishna, the Lord of the Universe, plays the part of an ideal son just to teach others how to treat their stepmothers. Generally stepmothers are not given as much respect as one's own mother normally, but here Lord Krishna is teaching, mother is respectable, and seven types of mother we have to respect. That is the perfect culture, Vedic culture, the most advanced developed culture, so that we can develop our Krishna consciousness, we can awaken our devotion, dormant devotion to Krishna, which is covered right now within the heart. So this culture is important from that perspective. Now Srila Prabhupada says that Lord Krishna teaches by his example certain things which are to be followed by everyone, but that does not mean we can imitate all of Krishna's activities, which sometimes people tend to do. Prabhupada explains in another lecture given on the occasion of giving a discourse on Bhagavad Gita, Srila Prabhupada says, Anukaran and Anussaran, two Sanskrit words are there, one is imitation, the other word refers to following the footprints. Anukaran means imitation, Anussaran means following the footprints. If one tries to follow the footprints of great personalities, that is very nice, but we cannot imitate. Imitation is dangerous. Just like Lord Shiva, he drank an ocean of poison and kept it in his throat, he did not allow that poison to go down, so he became known as Neelakanta, blue-throated, because he is holding the poison in his neck, in his throat. So if somebody imitates Lord Shiva and indulges in intoxication, ganja, he will go to hell. So this imitation of Shiva is dangerous, is dangerous.

#### Power and Contamination, Rules and Regulations, Following Examples

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "those who are powerful you cannot find some fault with them nor can you imitate their powerful activities that's never possible"
**Summary:** The lecture uses the analogy of the sun absorbing impurities without being contaminated to further explain why not everyone can imitate powerful figures like Lord Shiva, emphasizing the importance of following rules and regulations and appropriate examples.

Very dangerous. Now Shiva is very, very, very powerful. So somebody may say Shiva is smoking ganja, so why I can't smoke ganja? No, you cannot, because you cannot imitate Shiva, you can only follow Shiva in his footprints. Those activities which Shiva performs, among many activities that he does, only those activities which he performs for setting an example for the common people, only those activities we have to follow. Now another example Srila Prabhupada gives, just like the sunshine. The sunshine is so very strong that it is absorbing the moisture of the filthy place, contaminated place, contaminated place where one is passing urine, but still the sun is very, very, very powerful, so the sun doesn't get contaminated by absorbing urine from a filthy place, no. But if we try to live in a filthy place where people pass urine, then we will become immediately contaminated because we don't have the power to counteract that infection, we don't have it. So Bhagavatam says those who are powerful, you cannot find some fault with them, nor can you imitate their powerful activities, that's never possible. So for the common people, we have to follow the rules and regulations, and while following the rules and regulations, the examples are set by great personalities, only those examples which are specifically meant for us to follow.

#### Affection for Krishna, Spontaneous Love, Following Krishna's Example

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "krishna bowing down showing respect to all his stepmothers touching his head to their feet that is to be followed"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the affection the mothers of Dwaraka had for Krishna, contrasting activities that should not be imitated (like the Rasa dance) with those that should (like showing respect to mothers and stepmothers).

The 29th verse, ta putram ankam aaropya snehasnuta payodharaha harsha vikvalitaatmanaha vikvalitaatmanaha shichur si shichur netrajair jalaihi. The meaning of this verse is, the mothers, after embracing their son, who is the son? Lord Krishna, the Supreme Lord, sat him on their laps. Due to pure affection, milk sprang from their breasts. They were overwhelmed with delight, and the tears from their eyes wetted the Lord. So this is the affection all the mothers, the 18 queens of Vasudeva, had for Krishna, and this is a natural, eternal, spontaneous affection they have, relationship they have. So Shila Prabhupada says in the purport, when Lord Krishna was at Vrindavan, even the cows would become moistened by affection towards him, and he would draw milk from the nipples of every affectionate living being. So what to speak of the stepmothers who were already as good as his own mother. So we should not imitate Krishna in the matter of Krishna dancing with young gopis in the rasa dance or Krishna lifting Govardhan Hill, don't imitate, but Krishna bowing down, showing respect to all his stepmothers, touching his head to their feet, that is to be followed, that is to be followed. We should show respect to the seven kinds of mothers, including stepmothers, that is to be followed.

**Key Quote:** "that's why we require guidance for our guidance there are three authorities guru sadhu shastra"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the need for guidance from guru (spiritual master), sadhu (previous acharyas), and shastra (scriptures) to discern which activities of great personalities should be followed and which should not be imitated.

So one, certain activities of Krishna, certain activities of an incarnation of the Supreme Lord, certain activities of powerful personalities like Lord Shiva are meant for us to follow. So how do we know which activity we are supposed to follow and which activity we are not supposed to imitate? That's why we require guidance. For our guidance there are three authorities: guru, sadhu, shastra. Guru means our own spiritual master, the bona fide spiritual master, he guides, and the authority also is the scriptures, shastra, and the previous acharyas, their instructions, their injunctions. So three authorities: guru, sadhu, shastra. Guru means one's own spiritual master, and sadhu means the previous acharyas, and shastra means the scriptures. All the three are meant to be consulted which activities of great personalities we are supposed to follow and which activities we are not supposed to imitate. I'll stop here, thank you very much.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session, we will be discussing from the third verse of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Tam Upashrutya Ninadam Jagadbhaya Bhayavaham Pratyudyayukh Prajasarva Bhartradarsana Lalasaaha. The meaning of this verse is, the citizens of Dwaraka, having heard that sound which threatens fear personified in the material world, began to run away. Run towards him fast, just to have a long-desired audience with the Lord, who is the protector of all devotees. So this is the description of how the citizens of Dwaraka responded to that sound of Krishna's conch shell. Krishna was announcing to the citizens, knowing very well that they were eagerly awaiting his arrival in Dwaraka. So he sounded his conch shell. Before he actually entered the city, he sounded his conch shell. And what did the citizens do? Immediately they began to run towards the city entrance, simply to receive the Lord, to have his darshan, long-desired audience.

**Key Quote:** "The pure devotees, the liberated souls, the eternal associates never forget Krishna even for one moment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the citizens of Dwarka were liberated souls who are eternally connected to Krishna and constantly remember him.

As already explained by Srila Prabhupada in the Purport, the citizens of Dwarka who lived at the time of Lord Krishna's presence there were all liberated souls who descended there along with the Lord as entourage. They accompanied the Lord. They are all his eternal devotees. They are all liberated souls. They have nothing to do with this material world of karma. We take birth here because we have got the force of karma and we accept a material body. These devotees of Krishna, liberated souls, they come in their spiritual form as much as Krishna appears in his original spiritual form. And it is described, all were anxious to have an audience with the Lord although because of spiritual contact, they were never separated from the Lord. We should not think that they are forgetful of Krishna at any time. No. That is our condition that we forget Krishna and we are put into so much material miseries, material difficulties, material problems only because of forgetfulness of Krishna. But the pure devotees, the liberated souls, the eternal associates never forget Krishna even for one moment. They are constantly thinking of Krishna, constantly remembering Krishna, constantly in touch with Krishna through varieties of ways.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly, the citizens of Dwarka were all immersed in thought of the Lord while he was away from Dwarka to attend the battle of Kurukshetra."
**Summary:** The speaker compares the citizens of Dwarka's constant remembrance of Krishna to the gopis' remembrance of Krishna and emphasizes the joy derived from this constant connection.

Just as the gopis of Vrindavan used to think of Krishna while he was away from the village for cowherding engagements. The example is given by Srila Prabhupada, the gopis in Vrindavan. Krishna is to go for cowherding. The gopis would always think of Krishna when he was away from the village. Similarly, the citizens of Dwarka were all immersed in thought of the Lord while he was away from Dwarka to attend the battle of Kurukshetra. They were thinking of Krishna. They were remembering his pastimes. They were thinking of his beautiful form, of his qualities, of his relationship. Everything. They are constantly immersed and that itself is a source of unlimited joy for them. They are always in this. But there are varieties of experiences of this ecstasy in different times, in different ways. The ecstasy of the devotees is ecstasy. The ecstasy of the devotees is experienced by them.

**Key Quote:** "But Krishna is one Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker refutes the idea that the Krishna of Vrindavan, Mathura, and Dwarka are different, asserting that Krishna is one Supreme Lord who manifests in different forms and relationships.

Some distinguished fiction writer in Bengal concluded that the Krishna of Vrindavan, that of Mathura and that of Dwarka were different personalities because Krishna's activities are entirely different in Vrindavan, in Mathura and Dwarka. There are varieties of relationships, varieties of forms, varieties of activities, varieties of qualities displayed by Krishna. But Krishna is one Supreme Lord, one person, though he presents himself in different forms, in different moods according to the relationship. But he is one person. He is not different. There are not many persons there, only one person. Historically there is no truth in this conclusion. That means Krishna is the same everywhere, in Dwarka, in Mathura, in Vrindavan. The Krishna of Kurukshetra and the Krishna of Dwarka are one and the same personality. Advaitam acchutamanadi manantaroopam Not only Krishna in Dwarka, Vrindavan and Mathura are one person. Even Krishna and Rama and Narasimha and Varaha are the same person, Krishna, in different incarnations. Even in the spiritual world, Narayana, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha are the same person, Krishna. But he is present in different forms according to the need of reciprocating with his different forms.

#### Melancholy in Krishna's absence, Krishna as the dispeller of darkness, Awakening to Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Similarly, all darkness is dispelled, all ignorance is dispelled, all sadness is dispelled when Krishna sounded his conch shell and announced his arrival in Dwaraka."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the citizens of Dwarka felt melancholy in Krishna's absence, comparing it to darkness at night, and that Krishna's arrival dispels this darkness like the rising sun.

The citizens of Dwarka were thus in a state of melancholy. Melancholy means feeling of sadness due to the Lord's absence from the transcendental city. When Krishna was absent, the citizens were feeling sad. Krishna is not there. We long for Krishna. As much as we are put into a state of melancholy at night because of the absence of the sun, the example is being given. In darkness, without sunshine at night, we feel sadness. The sound heralded by Lord Krishna was something like the heralding of the sunrise in the morning. When the sun rises in the morning, the darkness is immediately dispelled. And thieves and plunderers and all kinds of rogues, they again go back into hiding because they stealthily try to do all their nefarious activities at night in the darkness. Whereas as soon as the sun rises, all these thieves and plunderers, they go away into hiding. Similarly, all darkness is dispelled, all ignorance is dispelled, all sadness is dispelled when Krishna sounded his conch shell and announced his arrival in Dwaraka. So all the citizens of Dwarka awoke from a state of slumber. Slumber means sleepiness. They were like sleeping in the absence of Krishna, and they awoke because of the sunrise of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the only protector of all his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is the sole protector of his devotees and explains the non-dual nature of Krishna, where his name, form, qualities, and abode are identical to him.

And they all hastened towards him just to have an audience, just to have darshan of Krishna's beautiful form. They all rushed towards Krishna, their entrance of the city of Dwaraka. The devotees of the Lord know no one else as their protector. Krishna is the only protector of all his devotees, and Krishna is the only one who can give protection. No one else can protect us. Especially in the material world, we are, that Prabhupada explains in the next paragraph. This sound of the Lord is identical with the Lord as we have tried to explain by the non-dual position of the Lord, Advaya jnana. In the Bhagavatam it is explained Krishna is Advaya jnana, the non-dual substance. That means Krishna is absolute. His name, his form, his qualities, his pastimes or his activities, his paraphernalia, his devotees, his abode, all are identical with Krishna. That means Krishna is fully present in his name, in his form, in his qualities, in his abode, in his devotees, pure devotees, in his opulence.

#### Material existence full of fear, Problems of material existence, Influence of Maya

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The material existence of our present status is full of fear."
**Summary:** The speaker describes material existence as being full of fear and problems due to our association with Maya, the illusory energy of the Lord.

Everything is Krishna. There are no two things. In the material world there is always matter and spirit. We have a material body. This body is different from us. We are spirit soul. Whereas Krishna is identical with his form because his form is completely spiritual. Krishna is identical with his name because his name is completely spiritual. So Prabhupada explains further the material existence of our present status is full of fear. Out of the four problems of material existence ahara, nidra, bhaya, maithuna food problem, shelter problem, fear problem, mating problem the fear problem gives us more trouble than the others. We are always fearful due to our ignorance of the next problem. We are faced with many different problems one after another. That is material existence. So the whole material existence is full of problems and thus the fear problem is always prominent. This is due to our association with the illusory energy of the Lord known as Maya. So in the absence of Krishna consciousness when you forget Krishna then we are in touch or we are trapped, captured by the illusory energy Maya.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting the Hare Krishna mantra dispels all fear and connects us with Krishna through his sound representation.

Yet all fear is vanished as soon as there is a sound of the Lord represented by his holy name as it was sounded by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the following sixteen words Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Chaitanya Mahaprabhu taught us this Hare Krishna mantra. He chanted and he also instructed us to chant Hare Krishna thereby associated with Krishna through his sound representation, through his sound form Hare Krishna mantra. Hare Krishna mantra is fully present in the Hare Krishna mantra. And as soon as we say Hare Krishna immediately all fear will vanish, all problems will disappear, all miseries will go away and we come in direct contact with Krishna if we chant and hear Hare Krishna. Chanting and hearing Hare Krishna is as simple yet very very effective and powerful way of driving away all fear of becoming free from all problems. So that is what Srila Prabhupada explains we can take advantage of these sounds and be free from all threatening problems.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that chanting Hare Krishna awakens our Krishna consciousness, leading to dependence on Krishna and liberation from all problems.

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is teaching us to put an end to our suffering in this world. Somebody may say how can simply chanting Hare Krishna solve all my problems? The difficulty is that in material existence we forget Krishna and we don't understand that we have to take shelter of Krishna for solving all our problems, for getting all our necessities, for getting complete protection from Krishna. But instead in forgetfulness we make so many other arrangements which are incomplete, imperfect, insufficient. All this can be solved simply by chanting Hare Krishna and awakening our Krishna consciousness to come to the state of dependence on Krishna, full dependence on Krishna, and thereby we become completely liberated from all problems. All our problems are solved.

#### Opulence of Krishna, Palaces of Dwarka, Bhagavan

**Key Quote:** "The personality of Godhead means one who is full with all power, all energy, all opulences, all beauties, all knowledge, and all renunciation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of the verse, focusing on the opulence of Lord Krishna and the description of his palaces, drawing from Srila Prabhupada's purport and defining the term Bhagavan.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 30th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Athavishat Swabhavanam Sarvakamam Anuttamam Prasadayatra Patneenam Sahasranicha Shodasha. The meaning of this verse is, "Thereafter, the Lord entered his palaces, which were perfect to the fullest extent. His wives lived in them, and they numbered over 16." So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, Lord Krishna had 16,108 wives, and for each and every one of them, there was a fully equipped palace, complete with necessary compounds and gardens. Full description of these palaces is given in the 10th canto. All these palaces were made of the best marble stone. They were illuminated by jewels, and decorated by curtains and carpets of velvet and silk, nicely bedecked and embroidered with gold lace. These things we can't even imagine in our present yuga. The personality of Godhead means one who is full with all power, all energy, all opulences, all beauties, all knowledge, and all renunciation. That's the meaning of the word Bhagavan—full of six opulences. Therefore, in the palaces of the Lord, there was nothing wanting for fulfilling all desires of the Lord. The Lord is unlimited, and therefore his desires are also unlimited. And the supply is also unlimited. Therefore, his desires are also unlimited.

**Key Quote:** "When the great sage Narada heard that Lord Krishna had married 16,000 wives after he had killed the demon Narakasura, Narada was astonished."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Narada's visit to Dwarka, describing the city's beauty, the palaces of Krishna's wives, and the overall opulence, based on the 10th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

Everything being unlimited, it is concisely described here as sarvakamam sarvakamam anuttamam—sarvakamam, full with all desirable equipment. Now, in the 10th canto, there is a beautiful description of the palaces of Krishna. In the 69th chapter of the 10th canto, there is a description. When the great sage Narada heard that Lord Krishna had married 16,000 wives after he had killed the demon Narakasura, sometimes also called Bhamasura, Narada was astonished. The Lord Krishna had expanded himself into 16,000 forms and married these wives simultaneously in different palaces. So, being inquisitive as to how Krishna was managing his household affairs with so many wives, Narada, desiring to see these pastimes, set out to visit Krishna's different homes. So, when Narada arrived in Dwaraka, he saw gardens, and parks full of various flowers of different colors, and orchards overloaded with a variety of fruits. Beautiful birds were chirping, and peacocks crowed delightfully. There were ponds full of blue and red lotus flowers, and some of these tanks were filled with varieties of vegetables, and varieties of lilies. The lakes were full of nice swans and cranes, and the voices of these birds resounded everywhere. In the city of Dwaraka, there were as many as 900,000 great palaces. How many? Nine lakh palaces, built of first-class marble, with gates and doors made of silver. The pillars of the houses and palaces were bedecked with jewels, such as touchstone, sapphire, emerald, and the floors gave off a beautiful luster. Floor giving off luster. Have you ever heard of this? The highways, lanes, streets, crossings, and marketplaces were all beautifully decorated. The whole city was full of residential homes, and streets and also the thresholds of every residential house were very clean. On both sides of every path there were bushes and at regular intervals there were large trees that shaded the avenues so that the sunshine would not bother the passer-by. In this greatly beautiful city of Dwarka, Lord Krishna the Supreme Personality of Godhead had many residential quarters. The great Kings and Princes of the world used to visit these palaces just to worship Lord Krishna. The architectural plans were made personally by Vishwakarma, the engineer of the demigods. And in the construction of the palaces of Lord Krishna, he exhibited all of his talents and ingenuity. These residential quarters numbered more than 16,000.

**Key Quote:** "The great sage Narada entered one of these houses and saw that the pillars were made of coral and the ceilings were bedecked with jewels."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the description of Krishna's palaces, focusing on the intricate details of the architecture, decorations, and the service provided by numerous maidservants and manservants.

And a different queen of Lord Krishna resided in each of them. As many queens, so many palaces, one for each queen. The great sage Narada entered one of these houses and saw that the pillars were made of coral and the ceilings were bedecked with jewels. The walls as well as the arches between the pillars glowed. The palaces were decorated with decorations made of different kinds of sapphires. Throughout the palace were many canopies made by Vishwakarma that were decorated with strings of pearls. All this is a factual description. This is not somebody's imagination. This is not some mythology, because the Lord is full of all opulences. So what is surprising if his palaces are so beautifully decorated. The chairs and other furniture were made of ivory and bedecked with gold and diamonds, and jewel lamps dissipated the darkness. The material nature by constitution is dark, but when there is a need of a light source, the Lord's palace was illuminated by jeweled lamps—the jewels which emit light. There was so much incense and fragrant gum burning that the scented fumes were coming out of the windows. The peacock sitting on the steps became illusioned by the fumes mistaking them for clouds and began dancing jubilantly. So beautiful. The smoke coming out of the windows seemed like clouds for the peacocks sitting on the windows, and they were dancing very jubilantly. There were many maid servants, thousands and thousands of maid servants in each palace, and all of them were decorated with gold necklaces, golden bangles and beautiful saris. There were also many man servants nicely dressed in cloaks and turbans and jeweled earrings. Beautiful as they were, the servants were all engaged in different household duties.

#### Spiritual World, Material Suffering, Attraction to Krishna, Material Pleasure

**Key Quote:** "This material world is filled with miseries. It's the nature of this material world. We don't belong here."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the opulence of the spiritual world with the suffering of the material world, emphasizing that Krishna's opulence is meant to attract conditioned souls and that material pleasures are not real.

So this is just to give us an idea. What is the kind of opulence of the Supreme Lord? You cannot compare it with opulence of the richest person in this entire creation, material creation. Of course, in the spiritual world, the Lord enjoys with all his devotees. He shares his opulences. Nobody there is bereft of any need, necessity. To serve the Lord, they have everything that they simply desire, because there are desire trees in the spiritual world. But even when Krishna appeared on this earth planet, He brought down his opulence. His abode descended. Dwaraka Dham, Mathura Dham, Vrindavan Dham descended with Krishna. And naturally, these beautiful places were full of the opulences. This is just to attract the conditioned soul, to prepare themselves to go to the spiritual world and live with Krishna as one of his associates in a loving relationship. Each one of us is God with Krishna. Krishna wants to attract us. Why are you suffering in this material world? This material world is filled with miseries. It's the nature of this material world. We don't belong here. Foolishly, ignorant people may think that even if there are miseries, let me make adjustment and learn to live, and try to enjoy the pleasures available in this world—the material pleasures available. But Bhagavad Gita says material pleasures are not real pleasures.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by inviting listeners to seek spiritual bliss with Krishna, highlighting Krishna's availability to all and the power of devotional service, particularly chanting Hare Krishna, to attain the spiritual world.

They are simply due to some sense contact producing some sensation, and it is wrongly interpreted as material pleasure. But actually it is simply different kind of distress. It is filled with distresses, this material existence, and different kinds of distresses are interpreted. Or if there is a relief from some distress that is thought of as happiness, pleasure, material pleasure. So we are entitled to pure spiritual bliss of the kind that Krishna enjoys with his associates. And in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is inviting, "Come. Come to me. Live with me. Enjoy with me." And that too in a loving relationship. Krishna is one. Living entities are countless. But that doesn't mean that Krishna is unavailable for some insignificant living being. No. Krishna is available for each and every living being in the spiritual world. Why spiritual world? Even the material world. He has expanded as Paramatma in the heart of everyone, of each one of us. He is available for each one of us, even in the material world. But material world is not direct. Spiritual world is direct relationship—directly available. So Krishna invites us, "Please come to the spiritual world." And simply by chanting Hare Krishna and perfecting our devotional service, we can immediately transfer ourselves to the spiritual world. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

coyly. So here is a description: when Krishna entered the palaces, he expanded himself into 16,108 forms and simultaneously he entered each of the palaces. So when he was in his home, he is available to each and every queen simultaneously, unlike the living entities of this world or even of the spiritual world. At least in this world, a yogi can expand himself into maximum 10 forms. Krishna expanded himself into as many forms as required, so therefore nobody can imitate Krishna, nobody can duplicate Krishna. So Krishna is the supreme unlimited personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "God is one but that one Supreme Lord expands himself in plenary expansions plenary means with full power in each of the forms that he expands his form is power is not diminished"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the queens' devotion and quotes Srila Prabhupada's purport, explaining Krishna's plenary expansions and the concept of oneness and multiplicity in the Supreme Lord.

And the queens, when they saw the Supreme Lord, their husband, their beloved husband entering the palace, they at once got up from their seats and meditations, but they were also shy, so they looked through the covering in a shy manner. So Sri Lak Prabhupada explains elaborately in the purport a very important point: the Lord entered his home palaces occupied by 16,108 queens. This means the Lord at once expanded himself in as many forms as possible. The Lord entered his home palaces occupied by 16,108 queens. This means the Lord at once expanded himself in as much as he could. The Lord at once expanded himself in as much as he could, as many plenary expansions as there were queens and palaces and entered in each and every one of them simultaneously and separately. Here is another manifestation of the feature of his internal potency. He can expand himself in as many forms of spiritual identity as he desires even though he is one without a second. God is one, but that one Supreme Lord expands himself in plenary expansions. Plenary means with full power. In each of the forms that he expands, his form is power is not diminished. It is confirmed in a Shruti mantra that the absolute is one alone, a come a va-advitiya, and yet he becomes many as soon as he so desires. These may be the same as the other shrutis and shrutis do not have the soul.

**Key Quote:** "The separated portions are representations of his energy and the plenary portions are manifestations of his personality."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between plenary and separated expansions of Krishna, explaining that plenary expansions are manifestations of His personality with full power, while separated expansions are representations of His energy with a gradation of power.

These may be the same as the other shrutis and shrutis do not have the soul. Manifold expansions of the Supreme Lord are manifested as plenary and separated portions. The separated portions are representations of his energy and the plenary portions are manifestations of his personality. The technical point: Krishna expands himself, his own personality in plenary portions. Full power, each of the plenary expansions. Like Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Narayana, Govinda. All of them have same power. All of them are the Supreme Lord. The same Supreme Lord. One and only Supreme Lord. Whereas he has got energies and expansions of the energies are called separated expansions. They are not plenary expansions. That means there is gradation of power in each of the expansions of the energy. As much as is required for the purpose of the expansion of the energy, only that much power will be present in the expanded portion.

**Key Quote:** "unbelievers become astonished to learn that lord krishna married more than 16 000 queens because they think of lord krishna as one of them and measure the potency of the lord by their own limited potency never make this mistake"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Krishna's transcendental potency (Vaibhava) and his title as Yogeshwara, emphasizing his unlimited siddhis and warning against comparing Krishna to ordinary beings.

Separated expansion. Thus the personality of God had manifested himself in 16,108 plenary expansions and simultaneously entered into each and every one of the palaces of the Queens. This is called Vaibhava or the Transcendental Potency of the Lord. This is the technical word Vaibhava. It means this is the spiritual potency or transcendental potency of the Lord. Because he can do so, he is known as Yogeshwara. In the level of the Lord, he is known as Yogeshwara. In the eleventh chapter, it is described Krishna as Yogeshwara. 18th chapter: yatra Yogeshwara Krishna yatra partho dhanur dharaha tatra sri vijayo bhutir dhruvanitir matir mama. Krishna is Yogeshwara. He has got unlimited siddhis, unlimited siddhis. Ordinarily, a yogi or mystic living being is able to expand himself at the most to tenfold expansions of his body, at most ten expansions, but the Lord can do so to the extent of as many thousands or infinitely as he likes. Unbelievers become astonished to learn that Lord Krishna married more than 16,000 queens because they think of Lord Krishna as one of them and measure the potency of the Lord by their own limited potency. Never make this mistake. Don't think Krishna is like another

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of marginal potency (tatastha shakti) and the distinction between the potent (Krishna) and his potency, highlighting the spiritual quality of both and the transcendental pastimes exchanged between them.

ordinary living being. No, he is the Supreme Lord, infinitely powerful, infinitely expanded. One should therefore know that the Lord is never on the level of the living beings and these living beings are but expansions of his marginal potency. Krishna has got one potency called tatastha shakti, marginal potency, and living beings are expansions of this tatastha shakti. One should also never equalize the potent and the potency. Krishna is the potent, the possessor of the potency, and the potency is the energy of Krishna, the potency of Krishna, energy of Krishna. So don't equalize the possessor of the potency, all the potencies, Krishna, one Supreme Lord with the potency itself, don't equalize. As far as the quality is concerned, there is not much difference between the quality of the potent and the potency. Both are spiritual. The queens were also expansions of his internal potency, internal potency, the queens, and thus the potent and the potencies are perpetually exchanging transcendental pleasures known as the pastimes of the Lord: Krishna leela, Ram leela, Narsimha leela, Varaha leela. That is the term used only for the Lord, his transcendental pastimes exchanged between the potency and the potent.

**Key Quote:** "he married only sixteen thousand wives and entered in each and every one of them in different palaces just to impress in the history of the human beings on the surface of the earth that the lord is never equal to or less than any human being"
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates Krishna's unlimited potency and greatness, emphasizing that even marrying 16,000 wives doesn't fully manifest his power, and describes the queens' constant meditation on Krishna and Vedic injunctions for women whose husbands are away.

One should not therefore become astonished to learn that the Lord married so many wives. On the contrary, one should affirm that even the Lord marries 16,000 million wives, he is not completely manifesting his unlimited and inexhaustible potency because he is unlimited. That's a fact. He is not completely manifesting his unlimited and inexhaustible potency because he is unlimited. That's a fact. That's a fact. He married only sixteen thousand wives and entered in each and every one of them in different palaces just to impress in the history of the human beings on the surface of the earth that the Lord is never equal to or less than any human being. However powerful a human being might be, no one therefore is either equal to or greater than the Lord. The Lord is always great in all respects. God is great is eternal truth. Therefore, as soon as the Queen saw from a distance their husband was away from home for long periods due to the Battle of Kurukshetra, they all arose from the slumber of meditation and prepared to receive their most beloved. See, even in Krishna is away from the palace, the Queen's are engaged in meditating on Krishna constantly. They cannot forget even for a fraction of a moment. None they're so attached, they're so pleased to always think of him. Krishna says that in the Bhagavad Gita: man mana, always think of me. So the Queen's and all the devotees, not only the Queen's, all the devotees in the spiritual world are always thinking of Krishna every moment, thinking of Krishna and thereby being very much satisfied and full of bliss, transcendental pure bliss. According to Yajnavalkya's religious injunctions, a woman whose husband is away from home should not take part in his social functions, should not decorate her body, should not laugh and should not go to any relatives house in any circumstance. This is a Vedic culture, scriptural directions also. This is the vow of the ladies whose husbands are away from home. At the same time, it is also enjoined that a wife should never present herself before the husband in unclean state. She must decorate herself with ornaments and good dress and should always be present before the husband in a happy and joyous mood.

**Key Quote:** "the lord's devotees cannot live even for one moment without meditating on the lord and what to speak of the queens who are all goddesses of fortune"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the queens' unwavering devotion and constant meditation on Krishna, comparing them to the gopis of Vrindavan, and explains how they abandoned their vows upon seeing Krishna's return.

So what about the queens of Dwarka? It is explained the queens of Lord Krishna were all in meditation thinking of the Lord's absence and were always meditating upon him. The Lord's devotees cannot live even for one moment without meditating on the Lord and what to speak of the queens who are all goddesses of fortune incarnated as queens in the past times of the Lord and Dwarka are all Lakshmi. They can never be separated from the Lord either by presence or by trance. When Krishna is personally present, they are with Krishna and when Krishna is away, physically away, then they are always with Lord by meditation, completely absorbed in thinking of him only. Now similarly, the gopis at Vrindavan could not forget the Lord when the Lord was away in the forest cowherding. When the Lord boy Krishna was absent from the village, the gopis at home used to worry about his traversing the rough ground with his soft lotus feet. By thinking thus, they were sometimes overwhelmed in trance and mortified in the heart. They feel for Krishna within their heart every moment when he's away from home, from the village. Such is the condition of the pure associates of the Lord. They are always in trance and so the queens also were in trance during the absence of the Lord from Dwarka. Presently, having seen the Lord from a distance, they at once gave up all their engagements including the vows as women described above.

**Key Quote:** "Although due to feminine shyness, there were many hindrances to embracing the dear husband, Lord Sri Krishna, the Queens performed that act by seeing him through the eyes."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains verses 32 of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the queens' devotion to Lord Krishna and their expressions of love upon his return.

In this session we will be discussing from the 32nd verse and the 33rd verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto Srimad Bhagavatam. The 32nd verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is, So this is spoken by Suta Goswami. He is addressing the sages of Naimisharanya headed by Shaunaka, who is described here as Bruguvarya, chief amongst the Brugus. That's addressing Shaunaka Rishi, who is the chief of the Brugus. The explanation here is, the ecstasy they experienced as soon as they saw the Lord and their natural reaction was to embrace him. So first they embraced him within the innermost recesses of their hearts, and then they embraced him visually, and then they sent their sons to embrace him, which is equal to personally embracing him. Now after all this, they tried to restrain their feelings by not shedding tears, but they could not avoid that. They inadvertently shed tears. These are tears of joy on seeing their beloved Lord returned to the past. Those tears, impassioned with his love and respect. This is a very important case for the Lord. So, how can this be fair? You know, Shaunaka and his wife were inside a palace after a long period of absence. So, Srila Prabhupada explains this in the Purport. Although due to feminine shyness, there were many hindrances to embracing the dear husband, Lord Sri Krishna. The Queens performed that act by seeing him through the eyes, by putting him in the course of their hearts. As soon as they saw the impression of the Lord within the core of their heart, these were their instincts, and by sending their sons to embrace him, still the act remained unfinished and tears rolled down their cheeks despite all endeavors to check them. So Srila Prabhupada further explains here, one indirectly embraces the husband by sending the son to embrace him because the son is developed as part of the mother's body. The embrace of the son is not exactly the embrace of husband and wife from the sexual point of view, but the embrace is satisfaction from the affectionate point of view. The embrace of the eyes is more effective in the conjugal relation and thus according to Srila Jeeva Goswami there is nothing wrong in such an exchange of feeling between husband and wife. So this is the explanation

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains verse 33, highlighting the impermanence of material fortune and the importance of surrendering to the lotus feet of Krishna.

for the meeting of the queens with their husband Lord Krishna, the king of Dwarka. Then the next verse, the 33rd verse. The meaning of this 33rd verse is, although Lord Sri Krishna was constantly by their sides, as well as exclusively alone, His feet appeared to them to be newer and newer. The goddess of fortune, although by nature always restless and moving, could not quit the Lord's feet. So what woman can be detached from those feet having once taken shelter of them? So Srila Prabhupada explains this elaborately in the purport. The result of somebody completely surrendering to the Lord and taking shelter of his Lord's feet. What is the result of that? Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, conditioned living beings are always after the favour of the goddess of fortune, although by nature she is moving from one place to another. In this material world, everyone, all conditioned souls are living. It doesn't matter if you are saying that you are living or not, you are no longer living. It is youratura. They are in a state of existence where they have to seek anything and everything that they want, that they need. That is not the state of existence in the spiritual world, in the association of the Lord. In the spiritual world everything is in plenty and merely by desiring anyone can get whatever they need because there are desiraries to supply everything in the spiritual world. But that's not the case in the material world. In the material world there are material laws which are working, the laws of karma, and one has to work in order to even maintain oneself. So, such conditioned living beings, means those who are under the conditions of material nature, all the living beings within this material world who have come here for the sake of material enjoyment, independent material enjoyment, in forgetfulness of Krishna, they always seek the favor of the goddess of fortune. And the nature of the goddess of fortune is she keeps moving from one place to another. She is not fixed up except at the lotus feet of Krishna. And further Srila Prabhupada says, In the material world no one is permanently fortunate however clever one may be. Nobody is always fully fortunate, no. There have been so many big empires in different parts of the world. There have been so many powerful kings all over the world. And there have been so many fortunate men. But all of them have been liquidated gradually. Permanently nobody is having all the wealth or the power or the other kinds of fortunes. It's never permanent. This is the law of material nature.

**Key Quote:** "The spiritual relation with the Lord is so enlivening and resourceful that no one can leave the company of the Lord once having taken shelter of him."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami contrasts the material and spiritual worlds, emphasizing Krishna's eternal youthfulness and the eternal bliss of the spiritual realm, free from the influence of time and material modes.

As soon as the body is finished, everything is finished, connected with the body. But spiritually it is different. What is the difference? That is explained in the Brahma Samhita. According to Brahma Samhita, The Lord is served very respectfully by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. The statement in the Brahma Samhita is, They are always in a lonely place also with the Lord, the goddess of fortune. But still the association with the Lord is so inspiringly newer and newer, that they cannot quit the Lord for a moment, even though they are by nature very restless and moving and are moving about. Another name for Lakshmi is Chanchala. She is restless. She always keeps moving around. But when it comes to the association of the Lord, particularly His lotus feet appear always newer and newer. That is the spiritual nature. And that is the special thing about the Lord. Adhyam purana purusham na va yauvanam ca. In the Brahma Samhita. Na va yauvanam. He is freshly youthful all the ways, even though he is the oldest personality. He is the youngest in the Brahma Samhita. He is the oldest personality. Purana purusham. Oldest personality. But his transcendental form never ages like this material forms. Never. And the form always appears freshly youthful. The spiritual relation with the Lord is so enlivening and resourceful that no one can leave the company of the Lord once having taken shelter of him. So that's why the scriptures are directing us. Take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. All your problems will be solved. No more any attraction will remain in the material world. Actually material world is not really attractive. It is a presentation of the illusory energy to bewilder the living entities who are desirous of independent enjoyment. It is just an interaction of the three gunas, producing a temporary appearance of some attractive features. But spiritual beauty, spiritual world is not at all conducted by the three material modes. There is no touch of matter there. There are no material modes. There is no destructive kala. The time factor is conspicuous by its absence in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "So therefore Bhagavad Gita directs us surrender to the Lord, and in his association you will be able to satisfy your desires completely."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains the concept of living beings as feminine potencies of the Lord, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Krishna for complete satisfaction and experiencing ecstasy through devotion.

So such a spiritual world Krishna is inviting all of us. The living beings are by constitution feminine by nature. Prakriti. That's the way they are designated or explained in the Bhagavad Gita. The male or enjoyer is the Lord, and all manifestations of his different potencies are feminine by nature. The Lord is only male, only Purusha, and all his potencies are prakriti, feminine. In the Bhagavad Gita the living beings are designated as paraprakriti. Apareyam itastu anyam prakritim vidhime param jivabhutam. The living beings are jivabhutam. They are param. Paraprakriti, or superior potency, spiritual potency. The material elements are aparaprakriti or inferior potency. They lack consciousness. Just like this table. This table doesn't have any consciousness. Any of the material items, objects, they don't have consciousness. Consciousness is only in the spiritual entities beginning with the living beings. Such potencies are always employed for the satisfaction of the employer or the enjoyer. All potencies are meant for the enjoyment of the Lord. He is the only enjoyer. He is the only Purusha. So therefore Bhagavad Gita directs us surrender to the Lord, and in his association you will be able to satisfy your desires completely. And that is what will be explained in the next few verses. How the devotees, they serve the Lord and seek and they are able to experience ecstasy, satisfaction, happiness, everything. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains how the Lord pacifies the earth by creating conflict among burdensome rulers.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udeerayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 11th chapter of the 4th chapter of the 1st Chant of Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this 34th looks as the Lord was pacified after killing those kings who were burdensome to the earth. They were puffed up with military strength, horses, elephants, chariots, infantry, etc. He himself was not a party in the fight. He simply created hostility between the powerful administrators, and they fought amongst themselves.

**Key Quote:** "I think every living being in this material world thinks I am an enjoyer."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the illusion of being an enjoyer in the material world and the influence of Maya.

He was like the wind which causes friction between bamboos and so sparks a fire. So Sri La Pravapada explains in the purport, as stated above, the living beings are not factual enjoyers of things which are manifested as God's creation. The Lord is the genuine proprietor and enjoyer of everything manifested in this creation. Unfortunately, influenced by the deluding energy, the deluding energy means the energy which puts us in illusion, the material energy, Maya. The living being becomes a false enjoyer under the dictation of the modes of nature, the gunas, sattva guna, rajya guna, tamo guna, the influence creates an influence such that I think every living being in this material world thinks I am an enjoyer.

**Key Quote:** "You see, God is God, nobody else can become God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the false sense of becoming God leads to increasing material strength and becoming a burden on the earth, causing suffering for sane people.

And that is a false enjoyer, because it is explained why false enjoyer, puffed up, puffed up by such a false sense of becoming God. You see, God is God, nobody else can become God, but we try to become God. And what happens? The deluded living being increases material strength by so many activities, and thus becomes the burden of the earth, so much so that the earth becomes completely uninhabitable. By the same people. The earth is meant for all the living beings who are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but some people, they try to lord over others, and they become burdensome for the earth. That the sane people, the saintly people, the sober people, they find it difficult to live on the earth.

**Summary:** The speaker connects the situation to 'dharmasya glani' from the Bhagavad Gita, explaining how the Lord appears to save the saner section of humanity and alleviate the burden of vicious administrators.

This state of affairs is called dharmasya glani. This is the term that is used in Bhagavad Gita. Yada yadahi dharmasya glani bhavati bharata. The fourth chapter, Krishna describes this. Or dharmasya glani is also described by Prabhupada here as misuse of the energy of the human being. When such misuse of human energy is prominent, the saner living beings become poor. The saner living beings become perturbed by the awkward situation created by the vicious administrators who are simply burdens of the earth, and the Lord appears by his internal potency just to save the saner section of humanity and to alleviate the burden due to the earthly administrators in different parts of the world.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord comes to actually reduce this burden."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how demoniac kings exploit others, and the Lord reduces this burden by creating hostility among them, similar to a forest fire caused by bamboo friction.

The Lord comes to reduce the burden of these vicious administrators, these demoniac natured kings who are not properly ruling. They simply amass wealth and power and exploit the weaker sections of society, or exploit the saintly people, or exploit the common people. The Lord comes to actually reduce this burden by eliminating. Eliminating means the Lord actually purifies them by killing them. He purifies them, or he delivers them, or he liberates them. Now the Supreme Lord does not favor either of the unwanted administrators, but by his potential power, he creates hostility between such unwanted administrators, as the air creates fire in the forest by the friction of the bamboos.

**Key Quote:** "Air is blowing. And the friction between two bamboos. That creates a spark."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the analogy of the forest fire, explaining how the Lord creates friction between demons, leading to their self-destruction.

Now here specifically the reference is made where the Lord does not himself involve in killing. He just creates friction between the demons, and they kill each other. And the example is given, just like in a forest, air is blowing, and the friction between two bamboos, and the friction between two trees, that creates a spark, and dry bamboo catches fire, and the forest fire destroys the whole bamboo forest. Similarly, even the friction between the demons, they fight each other, and they kill each other. Now Srila Prabhupada explaining the example given, the fire in the forest takes place automatically by the force of the air, and similarly, that means nobody goes to set fire. No human being is required to set fire in a forest. The forest fire takes place, the air creating friction between the bamboos, creating a spark, and the spark ignites a fire, dry bamboo catches fire, and it spreads.

**Summary:** The speaker connects the forest fire analogy to political conflicts, stating that they occur by the Lord's design, and only devotees are saved from false prestige.

Similarly, the hostility between different groups of politicians takes place by the unseen design of the Lord. The unwanted administrators, puffed up by false power and military strength, thus become engaged in fighting amongst themselves over ideological conflicts and so exhaust themselves of all powers. They will kill each other because they cannot tolerate different ideologies. Each one has his own ideology. Nobody follows the ideal Supreme Lord. That is the nature of demoniac quality people. The history of the world reflects this factual will of the Lord, and it will continue to be enacted until the living beings are attached to the service of the Lord. Those who become devotees, they are saved from this false prestige.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the futility of seeking material power, stating that those who do so are punished by the laws of nature and are bound to reincarnation.

Falsely declaring themselves to be God, falsely possessing power, which is not going to last, thinking that they are forever going to remain powerful. So till they become wise, they are going to keep on taking birth again and again, and every birth, they simply try to lord over, and they try to exploit others, and they are punished by the laws of nature appropriately. They cannot escape punishment.

**Key Quote:** "Daivi Hesha Gunamayi Mamamaya Duratyaya."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita 7.14, explaining that the deluding energy is difficult to overcome, but those who surrender to Krishna can cross the ocean of material existence.

Perfect justice is there in nature. In the Bhagavad Gita, this fact is very vividly described in the 7th chapter 14th verse, Daivi Hesha Gunamayi Mamamaya Duratyaya. The deluding energy is my potency, Mamamaya, and thus it is not possible for the dependent living beings to supersede the strength of the material modes, Duratyaya. It is not possible to supersede, but those who take shelter in me, Krishna is speaking these words, Mam evaye prapadyante. Those who take shelter in Krishna, they can cross over the gigantic ocean of material energy, Maya metam tarantite. The gigantic ocean of material existence, they are very easily able to cross it.

**Key Quote:** "Independent. Attempts at establishing peace in this world. Are never going to be successful."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that peace and prosperity cannot be achieved through fruitive activities or speculation, but only through surrender to the Supreme Lord.

This means that no one can establish peace and prosperity in the world by fruitive activities or by speculative philosophy or ideology. Independent attempts at establishing peace in this world are never going to be successful as long as people don't surrender to the Supreme Lord and follow the Lord's directions for establishing peace, for themselves becoming peaceful, and for bringing about peace in the entire world. Is never possible by human efforts, by people's speculation, by having their own ideologies. It's never going to work. The only way is to surrender unto the Supreme Lord and thus become free from the illusion of the deluding energy, this material energy which is acting, influencing, bewildering all the living beings. That influence one has to overcome by surrender to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Unfortunately persons who are engaged. In destructive work. Are unable to surrender to the personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita 7.15, explaining that those engaged in destructive work, the lowest of mankind, sinful, atheistic, and materialistic individuals, are unable to surrender to the Lord.

There is no other way. So Prabhupada Srila Prabhupada further explains, unfortunately persons who are engaged in destructive work are unable to surrender to the personality of Godhead. This is the 15th verse of the 7th chapter, Namaham duskruti no mudha. Duskruti naha means engaged in vicious activities, destructive work. That's their nature, demonic nature people, or those who are lowest of mankind, those who are sinful, those who are atheistic, those who are materialistic, they are unable to surrender to the Lord. They are all now four categories. Krishna has described in the Bhagavad Gita. Prabhupada is quoting that Bhagavad Gita verse, the 15th verse of the 7th chapter. They are all fools of the first order.

**Key Quote:** "They are all fools of the first order."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the four categories of people who cannot surrender to Krishna: fools, the lowest of mankind, those robbed of knowledge, and those with a demoniac mentality who challenge God.

Mudha. Mudha means they are compared to ass, donkey. And the second category, they are the lowest of the human species of life, Narathama, the lowest of mankind. The third category are the people who are Mayaya Apahrutagyana. They are robbed of their knowledge, although apparently they seem to be academically educated, Apahrutagyana Mayaya. By the material energy, illusory energy, their knowledge is stolen away. Though they have accumulated knowledge, they have studied, or they have academic achievements, all that knowledge is lost by the influence of maya. And the last category of these Dushkrutina, they are all of the demoniac mentality, Asurambhavamashrita, always challenging the supreme power of the Lord. They never surrender to Krishna. They always want to challenge. If there is God, I will defeat him, I will kill him, I will finish him off. I am powerful. I am supremely powerful.

**Key Quote:** "They only think in terms of body. And the. Material. Energy."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that those who hanker after material power are fools because they are ignorant of the living energy and spiritual science, and they cannot understand spirit without surrendering to Krishna.

This is their mentality. Those who are very materialistic, always hankering after material power and strength, are undoubtedly fools of the first order. They think that this material world, there is no controller, so let us take charge, let us take control. We will become powerful and defeat all the fellow humans and then control of the entire world. This is their plan, but they are fools. Why? Because they have no information of the living energy. They only think in terms of body and the material energy, and they are also ignorant of the supreme spiritual science. They are absorbed in material science. The end of the material body. Material science is like that. It has no understanding of what is spirit. They don't have understanding of the supreme spirit, individual spirit. They have no understanding of spirit at all, and neither they can really understand if they don't surrender to Krishna, if they don't take devotion and service. This will always remain unknown to them, and they will be always deluded by the material. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's pastimes may appear mundane but are actually transcendental, warning against misunderstanding the Lord's nature.

Here is a warning given by Suta Goswami that the Lord's pastimes, especially with his queens, with the gopis, appears like he is a mundane personality, an ordinary person. It appears like he is overpowered by their attractive features, but actually He is eternally the controller, the Master, the enjoyer, the Lord, the controller. Eternally always. The energies of his are always under him, whereas we become overpowered by another energy when we try to lord over. So there is a very big difference between ourselves and the Supreme Lord, though when he incarnates, he looks like one of the created beings. He looks like that he is not. That will be elaborately explained with Prabhupada here. In the purport, Prabhupada says, "The Lord married and lived like a householder. This is certainly like a mundane affair."

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's unique ability to expand himself into unlimited forms, contrasting it with the limited powers of yogis.

Like a materialistic person, an ordinary person, a person of this world. But when we learn that he married 16,108 wives and lived with them separately in each and every palace, certainly it is not mundane. There is no history of any person of this world marrying 16,108 princesses, never. That's not possible. And not only that Krishna married so many, but he lived with each of them separately in a separate palace. He expanded himself. That's also explained by Srila Prabhupada that a yogi can expand himself by power acquired mystic power into ten forms at most, but Krishna can expand himself into any number of forms, millions, billions, trillions, unlimited.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Krishna's relationships with his wives are based on pure, transcendental love, not mundane sex attraction, and that they are not ordinary women.

Number of forms he can expand. That is Krishna. Therefore, the Lord living as a householder amongst his competent wives is never mundane, and his behavior with them is never to be understood as mundane sex relation. This material world, everyone is driven by sex attraction, especially the male and female attraction is based on sex relationship, but the relationship of the Lord is based on pure love, and that love is free from all material characteristics or material traits. It is completely free from material characteristics or material from sex, sex contamination, or tinge of sex, sexual attraction. It is free from all that. The women who became the wives of the Lord are certainly not ordinary women because to get the Lord as one's husband is the result of many, many millions of births tapasya because to get the Lord as one's husband is the result of many, many millions of births tapasya, austerity. Who can become the wife of the Supreme Lord or for that

**Summary:** The speaker explains the necessity of purification through austerity (tapasya) to approach and understand the Supreme Lord, emphasizing that materially conditioned souls lack spiritual vision.

austerity? Who can become the wife of the Supreme Lord or, for that matter, the friend of Krishna? This is, these are all, the friend of Krishna. This is, these are all very accurately explained in the, very accurately explained in the Bhagavata, very accurately this explained. They perform millions of lifetimes of tapasya, and they become, they perform millions of lifetimes of tapasya, and they become completely purified of all material, completely purified of all material contamination. If there was in and without contamination, if there was in and without such tapasya, it's not possible to, such tapasya it's not possible to purify oneself, and without purification, one, purify oneself, and without purification, one can't even approach the Supreme Lord, can't even approach the Supreme Lord. One can't even see the Supreme Lord, what to, one can't even see the Supreme Lord, what to speak of approaching him. One can't speak of approaching him. One can't even see him. One cannot even know him. One cannot even know him. So he remains unknown to all materially conditioned souls, though when he incarnates, they are able to see him, but that seeing is not the spiritual vision by which they can see the spiritual form and understand the spiritual nature of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how Krishna displays his transcendental pastimes to attract conditioned souls and re-establish their eternal relationships with him.

They cannot. They think he is another person of this world, but that is completely wrong understanding. When the Lord appears on different lokas or planets or on this planet of human beings, he displays his transcendental pastimes just to attract the conditioned souls to become his eternal servitors, friends, parents, and lovers respectively in the transcendental world. Each one of us, we have got a relationship with Krishna, a relationship of pureness, pure love, spiritual love. Now love is a word not to be mistaken with loving relationships in this material world. Material world or relationships are based on the body, on matter, on material qualities. A relationship with the Lord is based completely on spiritual attributes. The Lord is completely spiritual.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the process of purification, revealing one's spiritual identity, and re-establishing a loving relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world through devotional service.

So when we become purified of all material contamination, then our actual spiritual form, spiritual identity is revealed. And in that spiritual identity, we can approach the Lord and actually reestablish the forgotten relationship, the spiritual relationship of spiritual love. That is what is being described here. In the spiritual world, the Lord eternally reciprocates such exchanges of service. He's got millions and billions of devotees in his personal abode, and he's constantly engaged in pastimes with them. Everything else is taken care by Krishna's own Yogamaya potency. In the spiritual world, nobody has to work. Nobody has to do anything to maintain themselves. They're simply engaged in a devotional service of Krishna, and they are enjoying rendering such service because the Lord reciprocates.

And then they experience ecstasy. That will be explained in great detail in the 10th canto. Here just a mention is being made because Krishna has reached Dwaraka. So when he comes to this world, the Lord displays his pastimes which are going on in the spiritual world, and he wants to attract us. You can also enjoy with me like all these devotees of mine are enjoying with me. That's what Krishna's message is. But foolishly, people think that Krishna is an ordinary person, and if he can enjoy with so many women, why can't I enjoy? This is a foolishness. This is a foolishness of materialistic people

who fail to understand the real nature of Krishna's personality, which is revealed in the Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad Gita and all the Vedic scriptures. It is clearly revealed. Now as regards service in the material world, Prabhupada says, "Service is pervertedly represented in the material world and broken untimely, resulting in sad experiences." We may establish a nice relationship with another person of this world, but it is broken when the body is finished. This body, material body is temporary, and the relationship lasts only as long as the body is there. When the body is finished, relationship is finished. The illusion living being conditioned by material nature cannot understand out of ignorance that all our relations here in the mundane world are temporary and full of inebriates. Inebriate means defects. Everything here is defective. Material relationships are defective, and they are also temporary. They don't last because the body itself is temporary.

**Key Quote:** "Material presentation by maya, we consider that as permanent, as eternal. It is actually temporal. And it is based on the fact that we are in a state of ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material relationships are based on ignorance and illusion (maya), offering only temporary happiness, while a relationship with Krishna leads to permanent happiness in the transcendental world.

So relationships based on body will be temporary, and it is temporary. It is a state of ignorance. As long as we are materially conditioned, we are in ignorance that we cannot understand the effect of the illusion. We think whatever we are perceiving is reality. Material presentation by maya, we consider that as permanent, as eternal. It is actually temporal, and it is based on the fact that we are in a state of ignorance, and it is based on the actions and reactions of the three gunas. It is not a factual reality. What is presented, what appears like real but is not real. Such relations means these material relations cannot help us be happy perpetually. Some temporary happiness may be there in such material relations, but it cannot give us permanent happiness. If the same relation is established with the Lord, then we are transferred to the transcendental world after leaving this material body. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of establishing a relationship with Krishna through devotional service, emphasizing that Krishna's wives are transcendental beings who have attained their position through bhakti.

This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita. If we establish our relationship with Krishna, then we desire each one of the devotees in the spiritual world have their own relationship with Krishna. So therefore, the women amongst whom Krishna lived as their husband are not therefore women of this mundane world but are eternally related with him as transcendental wives. See, that adjective transcendental is used. They are transcendental wives of Krishna, a position they attained by perfection of devotional service. Only by devotional service is possible. Bhakti amam abhijanati. Only by bhakti, and that bhakti also progresses in different stages of development. So there is a stage of perfection where one is firmly established in their relationship with Krishna. That is their competency because the verse says he enjoyed with competent women. What is their competency? They have perfected their devotional service and established a relationship as the wives of Krishna. So if we carefully understand this, we can give up this false attempt at trying to enjoy material, material, and re-establish our forgotten relationship with Krishna and

In this session, we will be discussing from the 36th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the section which describes Krishna's relationship with his queens, and Suta Goswami clarifies a very, very important point in this connection. The verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: Although the queen's beautiful smiles and furtive glances were all spotless and exciting, and although they could conquer Cupid himself by making him give up his bow in frustration, and although even the tolerant Shiva could fall victim to them, still, despite all their magical feats and attractions, they could not agitate the senses of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the transcendental qualities of Krishna, emphasizing his detachment even from the most attractive features, contrasting this with the influence of Cupid and even Lord Shiva.

Now, Suta Goswami is describing the transcendental quality of the soul, of the Supreme Lord in his association with his 16,108 queens. What is the spiritual nature of the Lord? He is un-agitated by their association, even though they are very, very beautiful. They have beautiful smiles. They have very, very attractive glances. They can conquer Cupid himself. Cupid generally agitates the mind of materialistic people in this world to get attracted to material beauty, but Cupid himself becomes attracted by the beauty of these queens. And the Lord Shiva is known as a Dheera, but even Lord Shiva, He may fall victim to the attraction of the queens, but the queens can never agitate the senses of the Supreme Lord, which means that why did Upanishad interact with the queens as if he was engaged in a mundane love affair?

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Srila Prabhupada's explanation regarding the path of liberation and the restrictions on association with women in various ashramas, raising the question of Krishna's association with 16,000 queens.

That is because of their devotion that we explained in the later verse. So here it is just stated by Suta Goswami that they could not agitate the senses of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the path of salvation, that means the path of liberation from this material bondage, are a path going back to Godhead always forbids the association of women, and a complete Sanatana Dharma or Vanashrama Dharma scheme forbids or restricts association of women. Srila Prabhupada explains elsewhere three of the four ashramas completely forbid association with women: brahmachari ashram, vanaprastha ashram, and sannyas ashram, no association of women. Only in the Grihastha ashrama there is permission to associate with women, that also under highly restricted conditions, only with one wife, and that also for the sake of producing Krishna conscious children and becoming responsible, raising children and becoming responsible, raising a Krishna conscious family. All these are there, Grihastha ashrama, Grihastha Dharma. So Prabhupada raises this question, how then can one be accepted of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is addicted to more than 16,000 wives? Krishna seemed to be very much attached to those Queens, and He is one person, and He has 16,108 Queens and is attached to them, so what is the proper understanding? This question may relevantly be raised by inquisitive persons really anxious to know about the transcendental nature of the Supreme

**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between Krishna and ordinary beings, focusing on how Krishna is not conquered by Cupid's influence, and how male-female attraction leads to material bondage.

Lord. And to answer such questions, the sages at Nainbi Sharanya have discussed the transcendental character of the Lord in this and in the following verses. What is that transcendental nature of Krishna different from the nature of people of this world? How is it different? So Srila Prabhupada further says, it is clear herein that the feminine attractive features which can conquer Cupid or even the supermost tolerant Lord Shiva could not conquer the senses of the Lord. Here is the difference, the distinct difference between Krishna and everyone else. Cupid's business is to invoke mundane lust. Mundane lust means his material lust. Material lust means materially attractive, material lust means material lust. Flute 아주 is the spirit with which the want of банal lust in spiritual earth is manifested. Extract love and karmically flow in the world instead of the lust. Tambad iramthis great 스ırहामि revenues from the the activities of the world are being carried on by the central attraction of male and female that is the central point of material existence a male is searching after a mate to his liking and the female is looking after a suitable male that is the way of material stimulus and as soon as a male is combined with a female the material bondage of the living being is at once tightly interlocked by sex relation and as a result of this both the males and females attraction for sweet home motherland bodily offspring wealth becomes the illusory

**Key Quote:** "Material existence means miseries under illusion we cannot understand that we always think miseries are now and then coming and going that's what we think but actually we are always in the middle of miseries"
**Summary:** The speaker describes how family life and material pursuits create an illusory field of activities, emphasizing that material existence is inherently full of miseries, using the analogy of climatic conditions.

field of activities. A whole field of activities opens up. Man and woman marriage each other, and then the family expands, children and relation and relatives and friends and home and wealth and accumulation of wealth, a society, friendship, community, all these things become the illusory field of activities, and thus a false but indefatigable attraction for a temporary material existence which is full of miseries is manifest. See, material existence means miseries. Under illusion, we cannot understand that. We always think miseries are now and then coming and going, that's what we think, but actually we are always in the middle of miseries. Sometimes these miseries are overlooked, we are not cognizant of them, or it doesn't bother us as much as it may bother somebody else. Just like the climatic conditions are related for some people. A cold weather is very much related to the situation of the world. Some Ontarians say that the cold weather is pleasant for the people who are in the cold weather, and they dislike the cold weather because the body, the body is pleasant for them because their body somehow they have made it acclimatized to the cold weather by generating lot of heat within, and they like this cold weather, but in summer they just can't tolerate even a little bit of heat, they cannot tolerate. And then the other people are not tolerant of them, so that's a concept. Whose body is very warm, they are not so uncomfortable in summer, but in winter they can't tolerate little cold also. The fact is this is told by one Acharya Govinda Das Kaviraj. We are always harassed by four different material conditions, climatic conditions: Sheetha means cold, Vata. Sheetha-Atapa means heat and Vata means wind and varisolana-the rain.

**Key Quote:** "Those who are therefore on the path of salvation for going back home back to Godhead are especially advised by all scriptural instructions to become free from the bondage of the world"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the struggle for existence and the path to salvation, emphasizing the need to become free from material attraction through the association of devotees.

Cold, heat, wind, and rain, these are sometimes there in different times of the year, and they always bother us. One or the other botheration is there, but we are so determined to enjoy that we'll somehow make adjustment and try to live amid such conditions, unfavorable conditions, and try to create a favorable atmosphere by adjustment. This called material advancement of civilization, but the scriptures warn us and awaken us to the reality. It is temporary, and you are simply engaged in a hard struggle for existence. So those who are therefore on the path of salvation for going back home, back to Godhead, are especially advised by all scriptural instructions to become free from the bondage of the world and become free from the bondage of the world and from such paraphernalia of material attraction because material attraction makes us forget the reality. We go deeper into illusion because of material attraction between male and female, and how is this possible to become free from this paraphernalia of material attraction? It is possible only by association of the devotees of the Lord, were called Mahatmas...Mahar Manas Tummampartha Day目. The Mahatmas are the pure devotees, they are always under the shelter of the internal potency of the Lord, the spiritual potency, and they are always engaged in devotional service, and such Mahatmas association will help us to become free from material attraction. Now Prabhupada explains elaborately that this material world is such that Cupid's work is going on to keep the living entities under material bondage, but association of devotees helps us to come out of this material bondage by losing attraction for all material things, by developing spiritual attraction to come out of this bondage. Krishna, it is not done in a void. It is possible by positive spiritual attraction, and that positive spiritual attraction is by association of pure devotees, association of pure devotees.

So it is described here, just like the Lord is transcendentally situated because of which he is never agitated. He is never agitated by any feminine attractive features. Similarly, if we situate ourselves on the spiritual platform, all material attraction will be nullified, attractions will be nullified completely, and we get attracted to Krishna, which is desirable, which is most desirable, which is the best, the safest, and the topmost position of perfection for any living being to get attracted to Krishna and to become attached to Krishna, to become connected with Krishna in eternal relationship of love. That is the goal. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But actually Krishna is only reciprocal."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that Krishna's dealings, even those that appear ordinary, are a display of his reciprocity with his devotees while maintaining his supreme position.

In this session we will be discussing from the thirty-seventh verse of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: tam ayam manyate loko yasangam api sanginam atmaupamyena manujam vyapruvanam yato abudhaha. The meaning of this verse is, the common materialistic conditioned souls speculate that the Lord is one of them. Out of their ignorance they think that the Lord is affected by matter, although he is unattached. These are words spoken by Srila Suta Goswami. He is speaking to the sages of Naimisharanya. He is describing the Lord. He is describing the transcendental position of the Supreme Lord Krishna. To a common person it may appear like Krishna is an ordinary man because his dealings look like, his dealings with his queens in Dwaraka appears like he is a henpecked husband. But actually Krishna is only reciprocal. He is reciprocating with them because they are his devotees. And he is only attracted by their devotional service. And accordingly Krishna responds with every devotee, every pure devotee. And even while reciprocating with his devotees, even though he may appear to take a subordinate position, his supreme position remains unaffected, because he is the Lord eternally, always, under all circumstances, in all times, at all places, in every situation, in his dealings with everyone.

**Key Quote:** "Due to ignorance only, the foolish mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the verse, highlighting the term 'abudhaha' (foolish) and describing 'mundane wranglers' who misunderstand and spread misinformation about God.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains this verse in the purport. The word abudhaha is significant here. Abudhaha means foolish because of ignorance. Due to ignorance only, the foolish mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord. Srila Prabhupada uses this term, mundane wranglers. Mundane means somebody who is of this material world, is completely covered by ignorance due to the influence of the material nature. Such a person is called a mundane person. And wrangler means one who simply picks up quarrel for even trivial reasons. One is always trying to pick up a dispute. So, these foolish mundane wranglers are those who are always trying to find fault with God, Krishna, incarnations, spiritual persons, transcendentalists. And they themselves are actually very, very materialistic. So, they can never accept that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. At the most, they may agree to accept some transcendental reality which is impersonal at the most, but even that they do not properly understand. So, Srila Prabhupada says here, the foolish mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord. It's always the case with such people. Not only they misunderstand, they spread their foolish imaginations amongst innocent persons by propaganda. They are also engaged in propaganda, that God is impersonal or God does not exist or everyone is God, or God is ordinary person like that. The Supreme Lord Sri Krishna is the original primeval personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Krishna's divine potency, using the examples of lifting Govardhan Hill and subduing Kaliya to illustrate his unlimited power and how every action of Krishna is full of this potency.

Primeval means he is the original person. And when he was personally present before the eyes of everyone, he displayed full-fledged divine potency in every field of activities. Now, if you carefully analyze every action of Sri Krishna, as described in the authentic scriptures, you will definitely find his divine potency working. Otherwise, how is it possible for a seven-year-old boy to lift Govardhan hill on his little left finger and hold it for seven days and nights continuously against a torrential rain, devastating rainfall sent by Indra? How is it possible? Only because he is unlimitedly powerful. That's the only explanation that can be given. Or he subdued that huge, powerful serpent Kalia who had 101 hoods and was very poisonous, spewing poison in the entire area of Yamuna lake. How could he subdue that Kalia? It's only because he is unlimitedly powerful. He is a supreme person. So, every action of Krishna is full of his divine potency.

And therefore, he is the Lord under all circumstances. As we have already explained in the first verse of Srimad Bhagavatam, he is completely independent to act however he likes. But all his actions are full of bliss, knowledge and eternity. This is the difference between Krishna's activities and our activities. He may appear like an ordinary person, but his actions are full of bliss. It gives pleasure to him and his devotees, always, every action. So, that is the characteristic difference in the quality of the activity, the nature of the activity. And his activities are full of knowledge. Nothing is ignorance. Nothing is done ignorantly by Krishna, and eternity. Everything is on the spiritual platform, on the transcendental platform. Only the foolish mundaners misunderstand him, unaware of his eternal form of knowledge and bliss. Foolish mundaners. These foolish materialistic people. They don't understand Krishna's personality. Why? Because they don't want to understand. They simply want to deny God. Now, the nature of Krishna's personality as eternal form of knowledge and bliss

It's simply meant for his pleasure pastimes. That's all. He doesn't have to do anything for the sake of maintaining this world or for the sake of controlling any particular thing. He doesn't have to do because his energies work according to his will. Sathya Sankalpa. Another name for Krishna.

Kala, Karma, Guna. So that is perfectly arranged by Krishna, that the seasons are changing, the sun is rising, the time is passing by, and systematically creation, maintenance, destruction is happening, and all the natural laws are working. Laws of nature are working perfectly. Every condition soars. Every soul is taking birth according to their karma, in course of time. Changes are happening. Krishna doesn't have to involve himself in details. The details are already coded into the material nature. That is Krishna's wonderful creation, that the foolish scientists will never understand, because they cannot decode that, because nature is working. They have their theories. Krishna is doing everything by the agency of his different potencies, while he remains eternally the supreme independent. He is aloof from everything, because he is engaged in his pleasure pastimes with his devotees.

**Summary:** This segment explains the difference between Krishna's internal and external potencies, emphasizing that Krishna descends by his internal potency and is unaffected by the material modes of nature (nirguna).

When he descends from the material world by his causeless mercy, to different living beings. When he descends from the material world by his own potency. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, I appear by my internal potency. What is the difference between internal potency and external potency? External potency is the material energy under which we are all placed, due to which we are in illusion. But Krishna does not come by the agency of the material energy, or illusory energy or external potency. He uses his internal potency or spiritual energy for all his activities, for his incarnation, for his appearance, for his activities, everything. He uses his internal potency. He is not subject to the conditions of the material modes of nature. We are all affected by something. Sattva guna, raja guna, tamo guna, always acting on us. But Krishna is completely aloof from these three gunas, even when he is in the material world. Nirguna. He is called nirguna.

**Key Quote:** "The correct understanding can only get from pure devotees."
**Summary:** This segment addresses the misunderstandings of mental speculators (mayavadis) regarding the impersonal Brahman feature and emphasizes that the correct understanding of Krishna can only be obtained from pure devotees through the parampara system.

Unaffected by material nature. The mental speculators misunderstand him as the supreme person, and they consider his impersonal features as inexplicable, Brahman to be all. The mental speculators are the mayavadis. They always speculate. They don't take the scriptural statements to be fact. They misunderstand the scriptural statements, and they always argue that the impersonal feature is the highest truth. Whereas in the Bhagavad Gita, Brahmano hi pratishtaham. It is clearly explained that the Brahman feature or the impersonal feature is subordinate to the supreme personality of Godhead. Yesya prabha prabhavato jagalanda koti. In the Brahmasamhita it is explained. The Brahman feature is the effulgence of the body of the transcendental form of Krishna. Very clearly it is explained everywhere. In the Vedanta Sutra also it is explained like that. So this. The correct understanding can only get from pure devotees, from the parampara system, from the proper explanation of the Vedic literature, given by the acharyas, Vaishnava acharyas. Only then you can understand. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So both the Lord and his pure devotees are unaffected by material qualities, material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that both the Lord and his devotees are unaffected by material qualities.

In this session we will be discussing from the 38th verse of the 11th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: एतद ईशनमीशस्या प्रकृतिस्थोपितद्गुणैहि नयुज्यते सदात्मस्थैर् यथा बुद्धिस्तदाश्रया. The meaning of this verse is, this is the divinity of the personality of Godhead. He is not affected by the qualities of material nature even though he is in contact with them. Similarly, the devotees who have taken shelter of the Lord do not become influenced by the material qualities. So both the Lord and his pure devotees are unaffected by material qualities, material nature.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord, Krishna, is transcendental only, nirguna, nirguna this word is used."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedas, Shruti, and Smriti, emphasizing the transcendental nature of Krishna and citing confirmations from various scriptures and Acharya Shankara.

So Srila Prabhupada explains this in the purport. In the Vedas and Vedic literatures, Shruti and Smriti—Shruti is the portion of the Vedas which is coming down through the oral tradition from the beginning of creation, whatever was revealed to Brahma by the Supreme Lord within the heart of Brahma, Tene Brahma Hrudaya Adhikavaye. The original Vedas and Smriti is the corollary literature in pursuance of the Vedas. The Vedas explained by saintly persons, great acharyas, great rishis, for understanding of the common people. The Smriti literature means the Upuranas, the Itihasas, Dharmashastras, like that. So all of them affirm that in the divinity there is nothing material. The Supreme Lord, Krishna, is transcendental only, nirguna. Nirguna, this word is used. The Supreme cognisant is always cognisant, is always full of consciousness and is supremely conscious person. Hari or the personality of God had a supreme transcendental person beyond the range of material affection. Hari nirgunasakshaa. This is the statement in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 10th canto. Hari, the supreme personality of Godhead, is a supreme transcendental person situated beyond the range of material affection.

#### Krishna's Activities, Material Nature, Divinity
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/kaq1QUSodbI?t=226
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So why should Vasudeva be afraid or why should Krishna be afraid?"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses potential doubts about Krishna's interactions with the material world, such as his birth in the Yadu dynasty and his killing of asuras, questioning why these actions appear to be influenced by material nature.

These statements are confirmed even by Acharya Shankara. Shankaracharya says, Narayana paro avyaktat. So he admits, Narayana, the supreme personality of Godhead is beyond this manifested and unmanifested matter. One may argue that his relation with the goddess of fortune may be transcendental. But what about his relation with the Yadu dynasty being born in that family? Or is killing the non-believers like Jarasandha and other asuras directly in contact with the modes of material nature? Because Lakshmi is situated transcendentally. People may consider his relationship with Lakshmi to be also transcendental. But what about Krishna taking birth in the Yadu dynasty as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki while they were imprisoned? And as if Vasudeva and Devaki are afraid that Kamsa will kill this newborn child, Vasudeva takes that newborn child and hides him in Gokula, Vasudeva under the care of Yashoda and Nanda. It appears like Krishna is afraid or Vasudeva is afraid of Kamsa killing the child. So why should Vasudeva be afraid or why should Krishna be afraid? Because Krishna only directed Vasudeva, take me to Gokula. So why did Krishna do so? Therefore, his taking birth in the Yadu dynasty as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki under very very peculiar circumstances or his killing the non-believers like Jarasandha and other asuras directly in contact with the modes of nature. This Jarasandha and all these asuras, they are completely entrenched in the three gunas and they are killed by Krishna as if Krishna had no other means of subduing these people.

#### Divinity, Material Nature, Control

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That is the affirmation in these words. prakṛtiṣṭhopi tad gunaihi na yujyate"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's divinity is never in contact with the qualities of material nature, as he is the ultimate source and controller of everything.

So the answer is, Prabhupada gives the answer, that divinity of the personality of Godhead is never in contact with the qualities of material nature in any circumstances. That is the affirmation in these words: prakṛtiṣṭhopi tad gunaihi na yujyate. He is in contact, appears to be in contact, but he is aloof, never in contact. Actually, he is in contact with such qualities because he is the ultimate source of everything. ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo janmadyasya yatah. Everything has ultimately got its source in Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the ultimate source of everything. So he is the source of the three gunas also. They are his energies. They are working according to his control and direction and his will. So, he being the controller, he will never come under the control of the materials. He will never come under the control of the material modes of nature.

#### Yogeshwara, Mystic Powers, Krishna's Supremacy

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Yogeshwara means he is the master of mystic power, or in other words, the all-powerful."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's position as Yogeshwara, the master of all mystic powers, contrasting it with the limited powers of ordinary yogis and highlighting Krishna's unlimited siddhis.

Please understand this point. He being the supreme controller always, eternally, why will he come under the control of material nature? He is known, therefore, as Yogeshwara. In the Bhagavad Gita, yatra yogeshwara krishnao yatra pārthodhanuddharah. Yogeshwara means he is the master of mystic power, or in other words, the all-powerful. A yogi in this material world, after practicing severe austerities, may get ashta siddhi, eight kinds of mystic powers, which will bewilder even the greatest of human beings. Everybody can be bewildered by the ashta siddhi displayed by some powerful yogis, perfect yogis. But Krishna is Yogeshwara, the master of all these yogis. And he only awards that ashta siddhi to the yogis. He has unlimited siddhis. Krishna has unlimited siddhis. A yogi can only have eight siddhis. Of course, eight major and eight minor. They have different kinds of siddhis. But maximum, eight major siddhis and eight minor siddhis, and four auxiliary siddhis. This is explained in detail in the eleventh canto of the Bhagavad Gita. But Krishna personally has unlimited mystic powers. So we cannot even imagine what are the kinds of mystic powers Krishna has. Just like a yogi, to give an example. A yogi can expand into eight forms, at the most, ten forms. Krishna expanded into 16,108 forms when he married 16,108 princesses and was living with them in 16,100 palaces. So that is Krishna, Yogeshwara.

#### Devotees, Transcendence, Goswamis of Vrindavan
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/kaq1QUSodbI?t=592
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even his pure devotees are unaffected by material kunas."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's devotees are also unaffected by material qualities, using the example of the six Goswamis of Vrindavan who renounced material opulence for devotional service.

Please understand this point. And Krishna's devotees, learned devotees are not affected by the influence of material mounts. What is being of Krishna? Even his pure devotees are unaffected by material gunas. The example is given. The great six Goswamis of Vrindavan, the direct disciples of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who were in Vrindavan, living in a very austere condition, for doing devotional work, according to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's directions. They all came from greatly rich and aristocratic families. But when they adopted the life of mendicants of Vrindavan, superficially they appeared to be in a wretched condition of life. But factually, they were the richest of all in spiritual values. The Goswamis, the six Goswamis of Vrindavan, tyaktva, toornam, ashesha, mandala, pati, srenim, sada, tuchchavat. They gave up all aristocracy and all material opulences. And they adopted the renounced order, Goswamis. And they were living like beggars, just begging for a little food. Little food, not much. And from whom? From the devotees, from the brajavasis, little food. And then doing the work of writing extensively the scriptures, preparing the scriptures for us, for common people, explaining the transcendental subject matter. And then they were engaged in excavating lost places in Vrindavan. And they were engaged in preaching Krishna consciousness. They were engaged in chanting, performing Sankirtana, showing by their example how we should do. So, such Mahabhagavatas, or first great devotees, all the moving amongst men are not contaminated by honour, insult, hunger or satisfaction, sleep or wakefulness, which are all resultant actions of the three modes of material nature. So, we can understand how they are unaffected by the three gunas when we see their behaviour. They don't care for any honour. Somebody praises them, they are not elated. And somebody insults them, they don't feel hurt.

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "So, there is a test you can apply to actually understand whether somebody is actually transcendently situated or not."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to recognize someone who is truly situated in transcendence, emphasizing that it's not just about outward appearance but also about their behavior and freedom from material desires.

They continue with their service unaffected by all these conditions. And the Goswamis were so controlled in their sense activities, they used to sleep for two hours or not even that. So, what were they doing? They were busy with writing books, with excavating lost places of Krishna's pastimes, and preaching and chanting and Sankirtana. Twenty-two hours they used to work, constantly engaged in such work. And with great internal pleasure, they used to do that, not as if it's a burden. Now, Prabhupada explains that some of them are engaged in worldly dealings yet are unaffected, the pure devotees. Unless these neutralities of life are there, one cannot be considered to be situated in transcendence. So, there is a test you can apply to actually understand whether somebody is actually transcendently situated or not. It's not just by dressing oneself in some saffron clothes or just remaining in some simple dress or staying in a forest. That alone is not the criterion. It's also how their behavior is under different circumstances. When they interact with ordinary people, do they become affected by anger or by insult? Or do they have any trace of material desires? Do they have any trace of envy? No. So, it is very, very evident and this is clearly proved by their interactions with ordinary people.

#### Divinity, Internal Potency, Devotees

**Verse References:** BG 9.13
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's internal potency is particularly the protector of the pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that the divinity and its associates are on the same transcendental plane, protected by the internal potency of the Lord, and ends the discourse.

So, the divinity and its associates are on the same transcendental plane and their glories are always sanctified by the action of the internal potency of the Lord. They are always under the internal potency. This is described by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita: mahātmānastu mām pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ. Krishna's internal potency is particularly the protector of the pure devotees. And Krishna himself also employs his internal potency for all his activities. I'll stop here.

#### Krishna's glories, devotee simplicity, Krishna's reciprocation

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The simple and delicate women truly thought that Lord Sri Krishna, their beloved husband, followed them and was dominated by them."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the verse, highlighting the simplicity of Krishna's queens who were unaware of His full glories, and emphasizes that Krishna reciprocates with devotees due to their unconditional devotional service.

This is the last verse of this chapter, 11th chapter. Tamme Nire Avala Moodha Strainam Chanu Vratam Rahaha Apramana Vido Bhartur Ishwaram Matayoyatha The translation of this verse is, "The simple and delicate women truly thought that Lord Sri Krishna, their beloved husband, followed them and was dominated by them. They were unaware of the extent of the glories of their husband, as the atheists are unaware of him as the supreme controller." So, the queens in Dwaraka, they were not aware of the glory of their husband. They were not fully aware of Krishna's glories, because Krishna's glories are unlimited. And they were very, very simple women. Devotees are simple by nature. They are not shrewd like materialistic persons. Devotees are very, very simple and straightforward in all their dealings. And devotees sometimes think that Krishna is very nicely responding to all their actions or all their interactions. But actually the fact is Krishna is only reciprocating because the pure devotees are engaged in his devotional service unconditionally.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even the transcendental wives of Lord Sri Krishna did not know completely the unfathomable glories of the Lord because his glories are unlimited."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Lord Ananta Sesha to illustrate the unlimited nature of Krishna's glories, which are beyond comprehension even for great beings.

That's the only reason Krishna reciprocates, and there is no other reason. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, even the transcendental wives of Lord Sri Krishna did not know completely the unfathomable glories of the Lord because his glories are unlimited. Nobody can estimate what is the extent of Krishna's glories. To give an example, Lord Ananta, Sesha, he has got millions and billions of hooves. Ananta means unlimited. So he is holding all the universes on his hooves. And how many universes are there? So many, millions and billions of universes. And he is glorifying Krishna by his millions of mouths. And he has not been able to reach the end of the glorification of Krishna. He's been glorifying since the beginning of creation. And he's been glorifying, glorifying. He keeps on glorifying till the end of the duration of this life of the universe. So which means to say that Krishna's glories are actually unlimited. Even Lord Ananta cannot find the end of his glories.

#### Yogamaya, transcendental relationships, Krishna's humility

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It's because in such a case of the pure devotees, there is the action of the internal potency of the Lord, the spiritual potency, the internal potency, Yogamaya."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the apparent ignorance of devotees about Krishna's full glories is due to Yogamaya, which facilitates the exchange of transcendental relationships, using the example of Arjuna ordering Krishna as his chariot driver.

So what to speak of anybody else? Now, the ignorance of the devotees, pure devotees, about Krishna's glories is not mundane. It's not due to material influence. It's because in such a case of the pure devotees, there is the action of the internal potency of the Lord, the spiritual potency, the internal potency, Yogamaya. Why is there this action of Yogamaya? Because there is an exchange of feelings between Krishna and his eternal associates which Yogamaya facilitates. The Lord exchanges transcendental relations in five ways as proprietor, master, friend, son, and lover. And in each of these pastimes, he plays fully by the potency of Yogamaya, the internal potency. He plays exactly like an equal friend with a covered voice, or even with friends like Arjuna. Arjuna orders Krishna, please take my chariot between the two armies. And Krishna very nicely takes the chariot exactly according to the order of Arjuna.

#### Krishna's supreme position, pleasure pastimes, devotional service
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/WRBy8LTfe14?t=356
**Verse References:** BG 11.41-42
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Simply for the sake of pleasure the Lord reciprocates."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna's supreme position is unaffected by His roles in pastimes, and that the Lord and His devotees engage in pleasure pastimes driven by mutual love and a desire to please each other.

But Krishna's position is not compromised when we realize Arjuna is affected by seeing the relatives on the enemy's side. He becomes afflicted by confusion. Should I fight? Should I not fight? And Krishna instructs him in Bhagavad Gita. So from that we understand Krishna's supreme position is unaffected by Krishna assuming the position of a chariot driver subordinate to Arjuna. He plays, that is Lord Krishna, plays, exactly like a son in the presence of Yashoda Mata. He plays exactly like a lover in the presence of the cowherd damsels. And he plays exactly like a husband in the presence of the queens of Dwarka. Such devotees of the Lord never think of the Lord as a supreme. They don't think he is supreme, but think of him exactly as a common friend, a pet son, or a lover, or husband, very much dear to their heart and soul. That is the relation between the Lord and his transcendental devotees. It's a relationship. And these are called pleasure pastimes of the Lord. Simply for the sake of pleasure the Lord reciprocates. And the devotees also serve him simply to give him pleasure. Krishna wants to please his devotees. Devotees want to please Krishna. This is what is going on in the spiritual world, in all spiritual relationships. Eternally this goes on.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord, when he comes down, he wants to give us a sample."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna descends to the material world with His associates to give a glimpse of the spiritual world and attract conditioned souls, emphasizing the need for purification through bhakti to join Krishna's pastimes.

This is not understood by the materialistic persons, by atheists, by common people, by those who are under the influence of the illusory energy. They cannot understand this. When the Lord descends, he does so along with his own devotees. He gives them an entourage to display a complete picture of the transcendental world where pure love and devotion for the Lord prevail without any mundane tinge of lording it over the creation of the Lord. See, what is going on in the spiritual world eternally, always. The Lord, when he comes down, he wants to give us a sample. He wants to display a sample of what is going on there. Why? Just to attract us, who are stuck up in this material world with a misconception that I belong to this material world. I am this material body. So, to deliver us, to get us out of this entanglement, Krishna very mercifully, very kindly comes. And he comes with his associates, and he displays exactly what is going on there, so to deliver us, so that we become attracted. Because Krishna is always engaged in pleasure pastimes with his pure devotees, we can also join Krishna in those pleasure pastimes provided we purify our material contaminated heart. That is important.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "In the spiritual world, or in contact with Krishna, in devotional service, there is always transcendental bliss."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the dry, unsatisfying nature of material existence with the transcendental bliss of devotional service, urging listeners to understand this difference through the descriptions in the Bhagavatam.

We should also purify by the process of bhakti. And we can also become completely free from material miseries, from material entanglement, from the repetition of birth and death. We can get out of this material existence, because Krishna will take us back to his own personal abode. Here, simply we are engaged in some lording over material nature, or engaged in some sense gratification, because we are always in want of some happiness. We are seeking happiness because our heart is dry without any natural experience of bliss. That is not our natural position in the material world, to always be blissful. In the spiritual world, or in contact with Krishna, in devotional service, there is always transcendental bliss, naturally. Always it is there. So, you should carefully understand this difference from the descriptions in the Bhagavatam.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "They are perfect representations of the marginal or internal potency in complete negation of the influence of the external potency."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's associates who descend with Him are liberated souls with pure Krishna consciousness, untouched by material contamination, unlike conditioned souls who desire to lord over material nature.

You should understand the difference. The devotees of the Lord who come with him when he comes to this world are all liberated souls. They may appear to take birth like ordinary people, like when Krishna appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki in the Yadu dynasty. His associates appeared in Vrindavan, in Mathura. His associates appeared like that. Neither Krishna is actually under the clutches of Maya nor his pure devotees associated with the spiritual world are under the control of Maya, material, illusory energy. No. Even though they take birth, even though they seem to be performing some ordinary activities, they are completely aloof, because their consciousness is, the devotees consciousness is pure Krishna consciousness. They are perfect representations of the marginal or internal potency in complete negation of the influence of the external potency. See, originally all of us we are pure spirit. We are originally not contaminated by material energy. But in association with this material world, with a desire to lord over material nature, with a desire to enjoy materially, we become contaminated. Whereas the pure devotees, they are not contaminated. When they come to this material world, they remain uncontaminated,

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The wives of lord Krishna were made to forget the immeasurable glories of the lord by the internal potency, so that there might not be any flaw of exchange."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that pure devotees don't seek material enjoyment because they experience spiritual bliss, and that Yogamaya allows Krishna's queens to forget His greatness, enabling a free and loving exchange of feelings, concluding with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

because they don't lord over material nature. They don't want to materially enjoy. Why should they materially enjoy, try to materially enjoy, when they have so much of spiritual bliss? Why will they want to enjoy materially? We are the people who are starving for happiness, so we take whatever illusory happiness is available, or we try to squeeze out material happiness by sense gratification. That is not the way the transcendentalists, the pure devotees relish spiritual pleasure. No. The wives of lord Krishna were made to forget the immeasurable glories of the lord by the internal potency, so that there might not be any flaw of exchange. See, for the exchange to take place between Krishna and his queens, if they become aware of Krishna's greatness, then they will not freely exchange their feelings of love for Krishna. Then they will be inhibited. So, to enable them to have a free exchange of their loving feelings with Krishna, the external potency will make them forget Krishna's real greatness, and they will think Krishna is like them, a person belonging to this world. Like that they will think. They take it for granted that Krishna is a henpecked husband, and they think that Krishna is always satisfying them, because he is henpecked. But actually he is satisfying, because he is pleased by their devotional service. That is the reality. So, we should understand this carefully from the Bhagavad Gita. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

These presentations were like the offering of a lamp to the sun. Yet the citizens began to speak in ecstatic language to receive the Lord, just as wards welcome their guardian and father. Beautiful description here. How did the citizens receive the Lord? They went with presentations out of love and affection for him to receive him. They went with some presentations. Now to whom are they offering these presentations? To the Supreme Lord who is fully satisfied. Atma Ramam. Satisfied in himself completely, 100%. And self-sufficient one. Purnakamam. He is independent in satisfying his desires. He is not dependent on anyone else. Unlike our condition, we are always dependent. We are never independent. We are never self-satisfied. We seek satisfaction from some other source other than our self. So, unto such a Lord, who himself is supplying everything they are having. But it is described here, it is not irrelevant. Their presentation to Krishna are not irrelevant. Why? It is like offering a lamp to the sun. The sun is the source of all light. And the sun's brilliance allows the sun to lied about rather than be in the readers' space. Let us go on to Ps. 129-8, that the sun always provides blessings and grace to the servants. So to this be puppies leaning onto an awaited God and forty to the assistance of peachy Followers, who are repenting, as company towardsray the Lord, so that others may come to his service.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always existing as Krishna, as the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's self-sufficiency, completeness, and eternal existence, contrasting it with the constantly changing condition of beings in the material world.

The sun is the source of all light, and the sun's brilliance and valor act as provision of divine light in life is showering to all beings. Moreover, while fleshments are through мелty subjects, absent  rose野 from the soil, now instead brightness in front of that what will a lamp be like it will be like totally non-existent but still when it is offered with devotion with with some feelings then it is accepted similarly the citizens were offering with love and devotion to Krishna their presentations and they began to speak in ecstatic language to receive the Lord so what they were speaking will be presented in the next few verses but they began to speak in ecstatic language they were fully ecstatic joyful Krishna has come back just as when some small children when the father is away and the father comes back home how they welcome their father with ecstasy joy in ecstatic words they welcome the father same way so in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains the supreme Lord Krishna is described here in his Atma Rama Atma Aramaha he is self-sufficient self-sufficient and there is no need for him to seek happiness from anything beyond himself he's complete we are a very very very very tiny portion of Krishna without our connection with Krishna we are incomplete this is what you have to understand to realize this incompleteness Krishna is also described in the Eshopan scriptures Krishna is also described in the Eshopan scriptures Purna madhaha Purnam idam Purnaar Purnam uddachyate he is Purna is full in himself complete in himself he is self-sufficient because his very transcendental existence is total bliss Krishna's existence itself is full of bliss the The entire spiritual world is full of bliss, the source of all bliss.

Krishna is always existing as Krishna, as the Supreme Lord, as the supreme enjoyer, supreme proprietor, supreme master, supreme controller, supreme belvisher, supreme guardian, supreme protector.

**Key Quote:** "Our identity as the tiny part of Krishna is eternally our identity."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of consciousness, refuting the idea of merging with Krishna, and emphasizes the importance of pure devotional service in offering to Krishna.

What is our condition? Constantly changing our position. At least in the material world, our position is constantly changing. Krishna is all cognizant. He is fully aware of everything. His consciousness is spread everywhere. His consciousness is universal consciousness. Now, sometimes people think that we can merge into Krishna and also become fully cognizant. No, that is never possible. One may try to merge into Krishna, but even after merging, the tiny particle of consciousness of the individual soul remains the tiny particle. The particle remains the particle. That is the law of identity. So, our identity as the tiny part of Krishna is eternally our identity. And Krishna as the complete whole is always the complete whole. He is never incomplete. We are never complete without our connection with Krishna. Krishna is also all blissful, total bliss. Krishna is the source of all bliss for everyone else. And Krishna himself is always blissful. Therefore, any presentation, however valuable it may be, is not needed by him. See, we become happy if somebody gives us a gift because we are in need. We are in need of the gift because we are incomplete. But Krishna is not in need of anything. Still, because he is the well-wisher for one and all, he accepts from everyone everything that is offered to him in pure devotional service.

#### pure devotional service, loving reciprocation, energy of Krishna, worship, love and affection

**Key Quote:** "It is all a sign of pure love and affection between the Lord and the devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna accepts offerings made with pure devotion, emphasizing the loving reciprocation between the Lord and the devotee, and comparing it to offering a lamp to the sun.

So, whenever you make an offering to Krishna, we have to do it in pure devotional service. Yome bhaktya prayacchati Whatever you may offer. Generally, devotees don't eat anything which is not offered to Krishna. So, they may prepare varieties of foodstuff for offering to Krishna. But Krishna will accept it only if it is offered with pure devotion. Not otherwise. Because he is not in need of anything. Still, he will accept when it is offered with pure devotion. That is his loving reciprocation with his devotees. It is not that Krishna is in want for such things. Because the things are themselves generated from his energy. Where are we getting all that we have, whatever we can offer to Krishna? We are getting it from Krishna only, through his energy. The comparison is made herein that making offerings to the Lord is something like offering a lamp in the worship of the sun god. Anything fiery and illuminating is but an emanation of the energy of the sun. And yet, to worship the sun god, it is necessary to offer him a lamp. Etiquette of worshipping any great personality in the Vedic culture. One of the offerings made is an offering of lamp, arati. So, in the worship of the sun, a lamp is offered to the sun, not because the sun is in need of illumination. The sun is source of illumination for all of us. But because it is a way of worshipping the sun god. Now, Prabhupada says, in the worship of the sun, there is some sort of demand made by the worshippers. They offer prayers, asking for something. But in the case of devotional service to the Lord, there is no question of demand from either side. Neither Krishna is in need of worship. Now, the devotees are worshipping the Lord. They are worshipping Krishna to ask something from Krishna. Because Krishna supplies everything that the devotees require completely. Devotees don't have to ask Krishna for anything. Krishna naturally, automatically, very lovingly supplies everything for the devotees. So, Prabhupada says, in devotional service, there is no demand from either side. Neither devotees demand anything from Krishna, nor Krishna demands anything from the devotees. It is all a sign of pure love and affection between the Lord and the devotee. This is the wonderful quality of pure devotional service. It is pure love. There is no demand.

#### father-son relationship with God, demands from Krishna, devotional service, unalloyed devotion, attraction to Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord is the supreme Father of all living beings."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the relationship between the Lord and devotees as a father-son relationship, explaining that devotees can ask Krishna for their needs, but Krishna will not provide anything that hinders their devotional service, leading to unalloyed devotion and attraction to Krishna.

So, it is free from any obligations. There is no obligation. The Lord is the supreme Father of all living beings. And therefore, those who are conscious of this vital relation with God can make filial demands from the Father. And the Father is pleased to supply the demands of such obedient sons without bargaining. Prabhupada explains, still, devotees, if at all, at any time there is any need for the devotees, they will only approach Krishna and only ask from Krishna. Though there is no need, but in case there is some need at any time, the devotees will only ask Krishna and nobody else. And Prabhupada says further, the Lord is just like a desire tree, and from him everyone can have everything by the causeless mercy of the Lord. But, Prabhupada explains one important point, for those who are practicing devotional service, whenever you need anything, you ask Krishna only and not anybody else. But, you should also remember, as a supreme Father, the Lord does not supply to a pure devotee what is considered to be a barrier to the discharge of devotional service. So, if we ask in our beginning stages of devotional service from Krishna, something which will block our devotion, then Krishna will not supply that. So, this has to be remembered. Those who are engaged in devotional service of the Lord can rise to the position of unalloyed devotional service. Unalloyed devotional service is pure devotional service, free from any mixture of karma, and material desires, free from all those mixtures. Pure devotional service, we can come to that position by his transcendental attraction. When he attracts us, spiritually. So, by pure devotional service, attraction for Krishna is awakened in the heart. Right on a material condition, we are attracted to so many different material things. That's because of ignorance.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that purifying the heart and awakening spiritual consciousness leads to spontaneous attraction to Krishna, his name, form, qualities, and activities, ultimately leading to pure devotional service.

That's because of our heart lacking Krishna consciousness. But, when the heart is purified of all these material misconceptions, and our spiritual consciousness is awakened, then spontaneously we are attracted to Krishna, Krishna's name, Krishna's form, Krishna's qualities, Krishna's activities, Krishna's devotees, Krishna's abode, Krishna's descriptions. We are spontaneously attracted. And then we become absorbed in hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. That transcendental attraction is the way to elevate ourselves above these gunas, above the modes, and become completely situated in pure devotional service. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the sixth verse and the seventh verses of the eleventh chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "Bhakti means knowledge, Bhakti means complete material detachment, Bhakti means pure heart. That is Bhakti"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that devotion to Krishna is not blind sentiment but is rooted in knowledge, detachment from material desires, and a pure heart.

This is one of the prayers offered by the citizens of Dwaraka to Krishna. The citizens said, "O Lord, you are worshipped by all demigods like Brahma, the four Sanas, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana and Sanatkumara, and even the king of heaven, Surendra, the king of heaven Indra. You are the ultimate rest for those who are really aspiring to achieve the highest benefit of life. You are the supreme transcendental lord, and inevitable time cannot exert its influence upon you." So these citizens are enlightened persons. They know what is Krishna's position. Their attachment or attraction for Krishna is not blind. They are not ignorant fools. They are completely knowledge. So one of the important points to remember is Bhakti means knowledge. Bhakti means complete material detachment. Bhakti means pure heart. That is Bhakti.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of bhakti, contrasting it with material sentiments and emphasizing the importance of progressing to actual devotion filled with knowledge and detachment, referencing Prabhupada's explanation of Krishna's supreme position.

Bhakti is not just a word of speech. Bhakti is not just another material sentiment. In a heart filled with material desires, in a heart full of ignorance, that is not Bhakti. That may appear like Bhakti, or that may be a beginning of one's expression of devotion to Krishna, but one has to make progress from the stage of sentiment to the stage of actual devotion, filled with knowledge, detachment, transcendental feelings, etc. So Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The supreme lord is Shri Krishna, is confirmed in Bhagavad Gita, Brahma Samhita, and other authorized Vedic literatures. No one is equal to him, and no one is greater than him." And that is a verdict of all this knowledge, all the scriptures. He is the supreme. The supreme means nobody is equal to him, and nobody is greater than him.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's position as the supreme Lord is not a position exactly it is he who is always the supreme"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's eternal supremacy with the temporary positions of the demigods, explaining that Krishna is constitutionally the supreme Lord, while living entities are dependent and influenced by time and karma.

Between Krishna and the other Devata's, between Devata's there is competition, though there is hierarchy among Devata's. But still their position is never permanent. The Devata's position is not permanent. The entire temple repose creation will be destroyed completely along with the demigods quitting their posts, that their body itself will be finished, so what to speak of their post. But Krishna's position as the supreme Lord is not a position exactly, it is he who is always the supreme. He is not occupying the post as if the post is sometimes vacant and somebody else may come. No, he is the supreme Lord constitutionally. The influence of time and space is exerted upon the dependent living entities. We are all dependent in this material world. Those are taken birth by force of karma. We depend on the material nature, and there is Kala, powerful Kala, which restricts our duration of life in this body, which limits everything what we can do. Now we as living beings, we are part and parcel of Krishna, but what is our position? The living entities are predominated Brahman. We are spirit, we are spiritual beings, and Lord is spirit, supreme spirit, supremely spiritual being. But we are predominated, we are controlled, we are subordinate to Krishna, whereas the supreme Lord is a predominating absolute. He is always the Lord, the controller, the master, the enjoyer, the supremely powerful. That we have to remember.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the two states of existence: Krishna consciousness, where one is protected by Krishna, and illusion, where one is governed by the stringent laws of material energy, leading to suffering.

As soon as we forget this clear fact, we are at once in illusion. There are only two states of existence for every living being. Either we are in Krishna consciousness, where we are properly situated under the full protection of Krishna, Krishna providing us with everything without even ever asking, or we are in the shelter of the illusory energy, and the illusory energy is very stringent laws which are governing every single being. We are in illusion because we forget who we are, we forget who is Krishna, we forget our spiritual nature. We think we are product of matter. We identify with the body. This is illusion, and threefold miseries constantly occur. We are constantly attacking the body, the mind.

**Summary:** The speaker defines God consciousness as the clear awareness of the living being, distinct from matter, and emphasizes the eternal subordination and gratitude owed to Krishna.

Cognizant means we are always full of consciousness, aware, we are always aware. That awareness is distinctly a quality of the living being as opposed to the body, matter. Matter doesn't have cognizant, doesn't have awareness, doesn't have consciousness. So we are not matter. We are not this material body. We are not product of material nature. No. In God consciousness or Krishna consciousness, one bows down unto Him. Him means Krishna, the Supreme Lord, in all circumstances. Eternally we are subordinate. Eternally we should be grateful to Krishna for everything.

The seventh verse: tvameva mātā atha suhṛt patih pitā tvam sad-gurur naḥ paramam ca daivatam yasyān vṛtyākṛtino bhavu vimā. The meaning of this seventh verse is, "O creator of the universe, you are our mother, well-wisher, lord, father, spiritual master and worshipable deity." Krishna is everything for his devotees. So that is being highlighted here. "By following in your footsteps, we have become successful in every respect. We pray therefore that you continue to bless us with your mercy."

So Sri Lapa Rāpāda explains in the purport, "The all-good personality of Godhead, being the creator of the universe, also plans for the good of all good living beings." See actually Krishna does not make a distinction between different living beings in this world as good and bad, but we become good or bad according to our good and bad, according to our attitude, according to our choice, the choice we make. So he has all good plans for us, Krishna. The good living beings are advised by the Lord to follow his good advice, and by doing so, they become successful in all spheres of life. Success in life, especially in human life, is not just about success when we follow Krishna's instructions, as he has given us advice in the Bhagavad Gita.

#### Demigod Worship, Material Desires, Krishna as the only worshipable Lord, Material and Spiritual Success

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "There is no need to worship any deity but the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker argues against worshipping demigods for material desires, stating that Krishna is the only worshipable Lord and can bestow both material and spiritual success.

This material world is such a complex place. People have so many material desires, and they sometimes think that the devatas can fulfill my material desires better than Krishna, or they are ignorant of Krishna. So therefore they don't even approach Krishna. They only go to demigods, or some of them who are completely atheistic. They don't even go to any demigods or Krishna. They simply depend upon their own personal strength, personal abilities, personal intelligence, without realizing all these personal things are given by Krishna only through material nature. So foolish people are like that. So Prabhupada says there is no need to worship any deity other than Krishna. Krishna is the only worshipable Lord for everyone. Even the devatas worship Krishna as was explained in the previous verse. Brahma, Shiva, Indra, the topmost devatas. Everyone, all the devatas are Vishnu Bhakta. Vishnu Bhakta Smruto Daiva Asuras Tad Viparyaya. Asuras are non-devotees. All the 33 crore devatas in this one universe are all devotees of Vishnu or Krishna. So if they are worshipping Krishna, why shouldn't we worship Krishna? They derive everything they have including their power from Krishna. So we should understand Krishna's position is absolute Lord, not relatively situated as Lord sometimes. No. The demigods are relatively situated. The Lord is all-powerful, and if he is satisfied by our obedience unto his Lord's feet, he is competent to bestow upon us all kinds of blessings for the successful execution of both our material and spiritual lives.

**Key Quote:** "Both materially and spiritually we are successful simply by worshipping Krishna, by depending on Krishna, by following Krishna's instructions even in material life."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that there is no need for separate endeavors for material success, as both material and spiritual success come from worshipping and depending on Krishna, highlighting the eternal relationship between the soul and the Supreme Lord.

This is an important point Srila Prabhupada is making. For spiritual life, somebody may think I may have to worship Krishna, but for material life, they think they have to worship some devatas or they have to work hard in material existence. No. There is no need of any separate endeavor for success in material life either. Both materially and spiritually we are successful simply by worshipping Krishna, by depending on Krishna, by following Krishna's instructions even in material life. And it is important to remember for attaining spiritual existence, the human form is a chance for all of us to understand our eternal relation with God. We have an eternal relationship with Krishna. It is not like the material relationships which are based on this body. They end with the body. Material relationships end with the body. Spiritual relationship is with Krishna, and that is eternal. That is never based on this body. It is actually the relationship between the soul and this Supreme Lord Krishna. It is eternal to Supreme Soul. That relationship, because soul is eternal. Krishna is eternal. Therefore relationship is also eternal. Soul to soul. Our relation with Him is eternal. It can either be broken or vanquished. Material relationships are broken. Spiritual relationship with Krishna is never broken.

It is just forgotten for the time being. Now somebody may be forgetful of Krishna, but it can be revived also by the grace of the Lord if we follow His injunctions. If we follow His instructions, it can be revived. And these injunctions are revealed in the scriptures of all times and all places. Shastra means that which gives us the instructions, how we can revive our memory of Krishna. That is what is actually explained in the Shastra.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's form is completely transcendental and it can be seen only by pure devotees, those who have the vision to perceive transcendental form."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that the residents of Dwaraka are expressing their joy at seeing Krishna and emphasizing that only pure devotees can perceive Krishna's transcendental form.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 8th verse of the Lakshmi, 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam: Aho Sanatha Bhavatasma Yadvayam Traivishta Panam Apidura Darshanam Prema Smita Snigdha Nireeksha Nananam Pashyema Rupam Tavasarva Saubhagam. The meaning of this verse is: Oh, it is our good luck that we have come again today under your protection, by your presence, for your Lordship. The Lordship rarely visits even the denizens of heaven. Now it is possible for us to look into your smiling face, which is full of affectionate glances. We can now see your transcendental form full of all auspiciousness. This is a verse spoken by the residents of Dwaraka who had come to receive Krishna when Krishna was entering Dwaraka after sounding his conch shell. All the saints were saying to Krishna, all the citizens who are waiting to have darshan of Krishna, they came running, leaving whatever they were doing. And they are so attached to Krishna, it is very evident from all these descriptions here. So what is their reaction to be able to see Krishna once again? They are telling, it is our good luck that we have come again today under your protection, by your presence. So devotees are always under the protection of Krishna, and they are able to directly see Krishna. That is special because Krishna's form is completely transcendental and it can be seen only by pure devotees,

**Key Quote:** "The impersonalists and the materialists, when they see Krishna, when Krishna appears and gives darshan as an incarnation, as Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, they see that form and they think that form is material."
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts the vision of devotees with that of impersonalists and materialists, who, due to their ignorance, perceive Krishna's form as material.

those who have the vision to perceive transcendental form. There are transcendentalists who don't perceive spiritual form. They are called impersonalists because their conception of the absolute truth is that the absolute truth is impersonal. Impersonal means no form, no spiritual qualities, no spiritual form, no spiritual name, no spiritual paraphernalia, no spiritual abode. So they are totally impersonalists. They are totally ignorant and therefore unable to see the transcendental form of the Lord even when he appears on this earth planet. So does it mean they can't see Krishna at all as a person when he comes? No, Krishna becomes visible, but they think the form of Krishna is material. That's what they think. The impersonalists and the materialists, when they see Krishna, when Krishna appears and gives darshan as an incarnation, as Krishna, Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, they see that form and they think that form is material. This is the biggest mistake made by non-devotees.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the perspective of pure devotees who recognize Krishna's form as transcendental and emphasizes the auspiciousness associated with seeing, thinking of, and describing Krishna.

As far as devotees are concerned, pure devotees, they see Krishna, but they also know Krishna's form is not material. They know Krishna's form is not material. So therefore, they are telling here, the residents of Dwaraka, they are all pure devotees, every one of them. So they are telling that Krishna never visits the denizens of heaven, but he stays in Dwaraka and just he had gone a little time for settling things in Hastinapura. So the citizens were missing him. They were missing him. And what are they able to see now? They are able to see Krishna's smiling face. Krishna is very, very kind to his pure devotees. So therefore, when Krishna sees them, they are able to see Krishna's smiling face. Now, further it is said, Krishna's smiling face is full of affectionate glances. That is because the relationship between Krishna and each and every devotee is one of loving affection. Therefore, Krishna's glance upon his devotees is full of affection. And they are also telling, we can now see your transcendental form. Krishna's form is fully transcendental and this is only known to the pure devotees. Nobody else knows this. This transcendental form is described here as full of all auspiciousness, Sarva Saubhagam.

Exactly like that, they are seeing Krishna face to face, which is impossible to be done even by the denizens of higher planets, the demigods, including Lord Brahma, the topmost demigod."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that only through devotional service can one directly see Krishna, a privilege not even afforded to demigods like Brahma, and describes how demigods can only access Vishnu indirectly in Shwetadvipa.

It is full of all auspiciousness. Just thinking of Krishna's transcendental form, seeing Krishna's transcendental form, remembering Krishna's transcendental form, hearing descriptions of Krishna's transcendental form, describing oneself, Krishna's transcendental form, all these are meant to bring all auspiciousness. In the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord in his eternal personal form can be seen only by pure devotees. The Lord is never impersonal, but he is the supreme absolute personality of Godhead." Krishna is not impersonal. Krishna has an impersonal feature but that is subordinate to the personality. And Srila Prabhupada says, "This absolute personality of Krishna is possible to be visited by devotional service face to face." By devotional service, a devotee directly sees Krishna, just like I see you or you are seeing me. Exactly like that, they are seeing Krishna face to face, which is impossible to be done even by the denizens of higher planets, the demigods, including Lord Brahma, the topmost demigod. It is described by Prabhupada here, that when Brahmaji and other demigods want to consult Lord Vishnu, the plenary portion of Lord Krishna, where does Vishnu stay? Vishnu resides in this material world in a special planet of his own, which is a completely spiritual planet, Shwetadvipa. And the demigods, when they have some problem, they visit Lord Vishnu in this personal planet, but they cannot enter that planet. They have to wait on the shore of the ocean of milk where Lord Vishnu is lying on Shwetadvipa. This ocean of milk and the Shwetadvipa planet are the replica of Vaikunthaloka within the universe.

#### pure devotees, material contamination, fructive activities

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Pure devotees means their heart is completely free from all material contamination. Material contamination is of two kinds. One is called material contamination of fructive activities."
**Summary:** The speaker defines pure devotees as those free from material contamination, specifically mentioning 'fructive activities' or the desire for material benefits from actions.

Vaikunthaloka is far beyond the spiritual sky even, but that Vaikunthaloka descends when Lord Vishnu comes into this world. So, neither Brahmaji nor the demigods like Indra can enter into this island of Shwetadvipa, but they can stand on the shore of the ocean of milk and transmit their message to Lord Vishnu, who is known as Kshirodaka Shai Vishnu. Kshirodaka means milk ocean. Shai means he is lying down on that milk ocean, on Shesha Naga. So, they can transmit message standing on the shore of the milk ocean. So, when they look at the milk ocean, they can't see anything of the island on the milk ocean. They can't see that. They can just see the vast expanse of the milk ocean, and they transmit their message to Lord Vishnu. Therefore, the Lord is rarely seen by them, but the inhabitants of Dwaraka, because of their being pure devotees, without any tinge of material contamination, of fructive activities and empirical philosophical speculation, can see the Lord face to face by the grace of the Lord. What's the meaning of this? Pure devotees means their heart is completely free from all material contamination. Material contamination is of two kinds. One is called material contamination of fructive activities. Fructive activities is the desire for doing material activities which will give some material benefit. That's called fructive activity. That's a contamination in the consciousness of a conditioned soul of this world. All of us, to different degrees, we have this fructive mentality. We will not do any action if it does not give us some material benefit in any form. We think that it is useless to do some work without expectation of any positive material gain.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "As long as the heart is contaminated by material contamination, one can never know the absolute truth. It's impossible. It's impossible to know the absolute truth."
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts actions of devotees with those driven by material gain, and discusses the futility of empirical philosophical speculation in realizing the absolute truth, emphasizing the necessity of a pure heart.

Whereas, devotees, they perform actions, they work for Krishna, exclusively for pleasing Krishna. They don't do any material activities. Pure devotees never do any material activities. So therefore, their heart is described as free from the tinge of fructive action. And the second material contamination in the heart is the empirical philosophical speculation. Speculation, you understand, people try to guess or try to conjecture whatever they can't see, whatever they can't perceive, whatever they can't know by direct perception, or even they cannot conceive using the descriptions in the scriptures. They can't relate with it. Then they try to imagine in their mind, by their fertile brain. This is called speculation. And it is philosophical speculation is by taking help of the philosophical descriptions in the scriptures, philosophical descriptions in the scriptures. And empiric is something which is verifiable by material methods. So impersonalists and some of the materialists and some philosophers, material philosophers, all of them indulge in this empiric philosophical speculation, and they think that they can realize the absolute truth or have an understanding of the absolute truth by this method. But the fact is the absolute truth can never be realized by any of such methods, material methods. As long as the heart is contaminated by material contamination, one can never know the absolute truth. It's impossible.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that the original state of living entities is to see the Lord face to face, and that this can only be achieved through bhakti or devotional service, under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master.

It's impossible to know the absolute truth. So the original state of the living entities is to be always pure in the heart and thereby be always be able to see the Lord face to face in his personal abode and reside there in loving relationship with the Lord. That's the normal condition. This present condition in the material world is a condition of forgiveness, condition of forgetfulness of Krishna. So, reviving our natural constitutional position is only possible by bhakti, by practice of devotional service and no other way. That is what Srila Prabhupada concludes this purport by telling, if you engage in pure devotional service under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, you can revive your original position. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Every moment seemed like millions of years when Krishna was absent from Dwaraka."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains how the residents of Dwaraka felt Krishna's absence, emphasizing their deep attachment to Him.

In this session we will be discussing from the 9th verse of the 11th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Yari Ambujaksh Apasasarabho Bhavan Kurun Madhun Vatha Suhradidrikshaya Tatravdha Koti Pratimakshanobhavet Ravim Vinakshnor Ivanastavachyuta. The meaning of this verse is, O lotus eyed lord, whenever you go away to Mathura, Vrindavan or Hastinapura to meet your friends and relatives, every moment of your absence seems like a million years. O infallible one, at that time our eyes become useless as if bereft of sun. A very beautiful verse where the residents of Dwaraka who have come to receive Krishna, when Krishna arrived in Dwaraka from Hastinapura after a long period of absence, they are expressing their feelings, how they were missing Krishna. Every moment seemed like millions of years when Krishna was absent from Dwaraka.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Without him, all our knowledge is either false or partial."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, comparing Krishna to the sun and explaining that without Krishna, our senses and knowledge are limited and we are in illusion.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, we are all proud of our material senses for making experiments to determine the existence of God, but we forget that our senses are not absolute by themselves. What is the meaning of this statement? Our senses are not absolute. This means that the senses can act only under certain conditions. Absolute means unconditional. For example, our eyes. As long as the sunshine is there, our eyes are not absolute. Our eyes are useful to a certain extent, but in the absence of sunshine, the eyes are useless. Lord Sri Krishna, being the primeval Lord, the supreme truth, is compared to the sun. Without him, all our knowledge is either false or partial. The opposite of the sun is darkness, and similarly, the opposite of Krishna is Maya, or illusion. The devotees of the Lord can see everything in true perspective due to the light disseminated by Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The pure devotee cannot be in the darkness of ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how devotees in Krishna consciousness can see everything properly due to the light disseminated by Krishna, and how pure devotees are always situated in transcendental knowledge, referencing Krishna's instruction to always think of Him.

So here is an example given by Prabhupada, rather the example given in the Bhagavatam itself, that just like the eyes are useless when there is no light, similarly, in the absence of Krishna, or in the absence of Krishna consciousness, when we are in illusion, when we are in mind, or in Maya, we are unable to see Krishna, or we are unable to see anything spiritual. Whereas the devotees who are always in Krishna consciousness, they are able to see everything properly due to the light disseminated by Lord Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada explains, by the grace of the Lord, the pure devotee cannot be in the darkness of ignorance. Devotee, pure devotee means always situated in transcendental knowledge, never in ignorance. That is the characteristic of a pure devotee, because the pure devotee is always Krishna conscious. Therefore, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, Manmana, always think of me. If we always think of Krishna, we are always situated in Krishna consciousness, and in that way, we'll never be in ignorance. We'll always be situated in perfect knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Everything in existence is only Krishna and his energies."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that everything is Krishna and His energies, differentiating between spiritual and material energy, and how material energy acts as illusion for conditioned souls who are forgetful of Krishna.

Srila Prabhupada continues to explain, therefore, it is necessary that we must always be in the sight of Lord Krishna, so that we can see both ourselves and the Lord with his different energies. Elsewhere it is explained that everything in existence is only Krishna and his energies. Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead, and he has many varieties of energies. All his energies are transcendental, spiritual, because he is complete spirit. So since his energies emanate from him, they cannot be anything material. They are all spiritual. But what is described as material energy, which is Krishna's another type of energy, is only material for the conditioned souls, for those who are forgetful of Krishna, for those who are in the darkness of ignorance. For them, this material energy acts to put them in illusion. But factually, this material energy is also Krishna's own energy for the purpose of the conditioned souls. This we have to carefully...

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the desire for independent enjoyment and forgetfulness of Krishna leads to being placed in the material energy, and emphasizes the need to come out of this contamination.

In the state of forgetfulness of Krishna, we are placed in the material energy of Krishna's spiritual energy, the internal potency, the spiritual world. So this material world is Krishna's material energy. But when we forget Krishna, or we desire independent enjoyment, or we become, because of our desire to seek independent enjoyment, independent of Krishna, we want to be Krishna. So as long as we are desirous of material enjoyment, as long as we be Krishna, we cannot know Krishna. So we have to come out of this contamination.

To remove the material contamination, to purify the heart of all material contamination, is the process of Bhakti. Even the chanting of Hare Krishna is described by Krishna. We begin cleansing our heart of material contamination. Now this material contamination is accumulated over millions of lifetimes. So only when we take to Krishna consciousness and the heart of our heart is cleansing of all material activity of our heart is accumulated of material activity of our heart is accumulated of our heart is of material activity of material off the heart is our heart is accumulated of material activity of our heart is accumulated of the material variable of material of the reaction of are due to our own misdeeds in the past so learn to tolerate them while you are...

**Summary:** The speaker encourages tolerance of material miseries, understanding our spiritual identity, and engaging in Krishna conscious activities to cleanse the heart and become situated on the spiritual platform, concluding with a call to become Krishna Conscious like the residents of Dwarka.

in the material world with a material body, also it helps if you try to understand that you are not this material body, you don't belong to the material world. Even now in your present condition, within your heart you are situated as pure spirit in pure Krishna consciousness, as a pure devotee of Krishna. So you just have to penetrate the layers of coverings and enter your own inner heart, in a portion of the heart, the core of the heart, and the process is the process of bhakti. So in the beginning stages it is a process of cleansing the heart. So till the heart is cleansed we cannot enter the inner heart of the heart and enter the inner heart of the heart and we cannot remember the core of our heart, we cannot enter the spiritual realm within our heart, our own spiritual existence, we cannot get into. So we have to wait for the cleansing in our body to happen, so therefore we have to learn fro readiness in life. We have to come to Krishna Consciousness by the process of Bhakti and that is what is being explained by Prabhupada in this purport. Just like the residents of Dwarka are always Krishna Conscious, similarly we should also become Krishna Conscious by constantly chanting Krishna's name, hearing about his glories, hearing the pastimes of Krishna from the Bhagavatam, like that performing more and more Krishna Conscious activities. And in this way, if we become Krishna Conscious, we can very quickly cleanse our heart and become situated on the spiritual platform, even while in this material world we can be in spiritual consciousness and thereby in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "like that for the all powerful lord unlimited lord it is very very insignificant to vanquish the radiation of the brahmastra"
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the Lord easily vanquished the Brahmastra aimed at Pariksit, comparing it to the sun evaporating a dewdrop, highlighting the Lord's unlimited power.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Deviim Saraswatiim Vyasam Tato Jaya Mudhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing the 10th and 11th verses of the 12th chapter of 1st Canto Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this verse is: The Lord was thus engaged in vanquishing the radiation of the Brahmastra just as the sun evaporates a drop of dew. He was observed by the child, who thought about who he was, while Pariksit is being given darshan by the Lord. What was the Lord doing? He was engaged in vanquishing the radiation of the Brahmastra. He was protecting child Pariksit from being destroyed by the Brahmastra. The Brahmastra, its power, is so immense. It can destroy one whole universe. That is the power of Brahmastra. That Brahmastra, the Lord vanquished as easily as the sun evaporates a drop of dew, one drop of water that is condensed on a blade of grass. When the sun rises in the morning and dispels the darkness and even the cold that's in winter, when water vapor condenses and a droplet is sitting on a blade of grass, and the sun rises, it can evaporate the drop of dew, not only one drop, but millions and billions and trillions of drops of water everywhere. The sun will immediately evaporate like that.

**Key Quote:** "krishna is always eternally unlimitedly powerful so therefore never compare krishna with any devatas"
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Krishna's unlimited power and warns against comparing Him to demigods, who derive their power from Krishna.

Like that, for the all-powerful Lord, the unlimited Lord, it is very insignificant to vanquish the radiation of the Brahmastra because, even though the Brahmastra is very powerful, it has so much destructive power, but it is limited, and Krishna's strength, or Krishna's potencies, are unlimited. This difference always exists between Krishna and everyone else. So, Srila Prabhupada says the devatas, however powerful they may be, they are powerful by limitation, and Krishna is always eternally, unlimitedly powerful. So, therefore, never compare Krishna with any devatas, never compare Krishna with Shiva or Brahma or Durga, any devata or devi. You don't compare Krishna. Krishna is always unlimitedly powerful. And, in fact, the demigods, the devatas, the devi devatas, they are all deriving from Krishna. Whatever power they may have, they're deriving from Krishna's unlimited source.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts how Krishna entered Uttara's womb, saved Pariksit from the Brahmastra, and then disappeared after giving darshan.

Krishna is the ultimate source of everyone's power. So, Krishna entered the womb of Mother Uttara, Pariksit's mother, and saved that child Pariksit by simply vanquishing that radiation of Brahmastra, just like the sun evaporates a small droplet of water as soon as it rises. The 11th verse, the meaning of this 11th verse: While thus being observed by the child, the Supreme Lord, Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul of everyone, and the protector of the righteous, who stretches in all directions and who is unlimited by time and space, disappeared at once. Krishna's work is over. He vanquished the Brahmastra, saved Pariksit, and gave him darshan, unlimited time and space.

#### Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mayavadi Philosophy, Difference between Lord and Living Beings

**Key Quote:** "This one difference, if you remember, immediately we can understand the difference between the Supreme Lord Krishna and every other living being, in whatever position, whatever situation, whatever power, whatever position, no living being can compare with the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between the Supreme Lord and individual living beings, refuting the Mayavadi philosophy that equates all living beings with God, emphasizing the Lord's unlimited nature.

gave darshan and immediately he disappeared. So, Srila Prabhupada explains the description of the Lord means He is all-pervading Supersoul, Bhagavan. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the protector of the righteous, the Supreme Lord, all kinds of opulences including power. That Supreme Lord, while He was being observed by the child, He suddenly disappeared. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Child Pariksit was not observing a living being who is limited by time and space. There is a gulf of difference between the Lord and the individual living being." This should particularly be noted by the Mayavadi philosophers. They always think that every living being is ultimately God, Brahman, or Supreme, or Absolute Truth, or Atma, whatever term they may use. They think there is no difference between God and each one of us, but that is wrong. The Lord is mentioned herein as a Supreme living being, unlimited by time and space, whereas every living being is limited by time and space. This one difference, if you remember, immediately we can understand the difference between the Supreme Lord Krishna and every other living being, in whatever position, whatever situation, whatever power, whatever position, no living being can compare with the Lord. Even though a living being is qualitatively one with the Lord, qualitatively one means in quality, we are spirit, in quality, the Lord is also completely spiritual. Quantitatively, there is a great difference between the Supreme Soul and the common individual soul. It's a very, very big difference. You cannot conceive what's the difference.

#### All-pervasiveness, Consciousness, Krishna's Presence

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is in your body, my body, everyone's body, everybody. That's the difference between Krishna and each one of us."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of all-pervasiveness, contrasting the limited consciousness of individual souls within their bodies with Krishna's unlimited consciousness that pervades everything.

Unlimited versus limited, the difference. In the Bhagavad Gita, both the living beings and the Supreme Being are said to be all-pervading. That is the description of the Lord. The living being is described as all-pervading, the spirit soul. But, there is a difference between these two. There is a difference between these two kinds of all-pervasiveness. What's the difference? A common living being or soul can be all-pervading within his own limited body. I am present throughout my body. That's why if an ant bites my toe, immediately I come to know, or an ant bites somewhere in my forehead, I immediately come to know. Because, even though I am a very tiny spirit, even though I am a very tiny spirit soul within this body, by my consciousness, I am present everywhere. My consciousness is spread throughout my body. Your consciousness is spread throughout your body. Even Brahma's consciousness is spread throughout his body. But, what about Krishna? What about Krishna's awareness or consciousness? It is spread everywhere: in the spiritual world, in the material world, in every universe, in every planet, in every living being, in every space, in all time. No limitation. The Supreme living being is all-pervading in all space and all time. You see, all space and all time. A common living being cannot extend its influence over another common living being by its all-pervasion. Very simple example: I am within this body. By even using yogic power, I cannot extend my influence over another person's body. Not possible. But the Supreme Supersoul, the Personality of God, is unlimitedly able to exert its influence over all places and all times and over all living beings. See, Krishna enters into the heart of every living being. I have entered into this body. I am situated in this body. Krishna has entered into my body, your body. You are situated in your body. You are not in my body. I am not in your body. Krishna is in your body, my body, everyone's body, everybody.

**Key Quote:** "Because he is all-pervasive, unlimited by time and space, he can appear even within the womb of the mother of child Parikshit."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's all-pervasiveness allows Him to appear anywhere, unlike limited living beings, and that He protects those who are surrendered to Him.

That's the difference between Krishna and each one of us. Because He is all-pervasive, unlimited by time and space, He can appear even within the womb of the mother of child Parikshit. Try to understand this point. He can appear anywhere, wherever He pleases, wherever He wants to. We cannot do so. We are limited, always limited, where we can go, how much we can exert a certain influence. That also, empowered by Krishna. Now, the Lord is described as all-pervading through all time and space. He is also described here as the protector of the righteous, Dharmakut. Anyone who is a surrendered soul unto the Supreme is righteous, and he is specifically protected by the Lord in all circumstances. So, if we have surrendered to Krishna, we are protected by Krishna always, in all situations, all circumstances.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord is the indirect protector of the unrighteous also."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord indirectly protects the unrighteous by rectifying their sins through His external energy, and describes the Lord as being dressed in all ten directions, signifying His presence everywhere.

Now, Srila Prabhupada says a very important point here. The Lord is the indirect protector of the unrighteous also. Directly, He protects all those who are surrendered souls who are righteous, but He is also the indirect protector of the unrighteous, those who are not righteous, for He rectifies their sins through His external energy. The external energy is controlling all the unrighteous souls to rectify their mentality of being rebellious to the Supreme, of their mentality of not surrendering to Krishna, so that, when they surrender, they become completely protected by the Lord. They become delivered from this material existence. They are free from all material miseries, material bondage. The Lord is mentioned herein as one who is dressed in ten directions, Dasha ma sasya mishato dasha ma sasya, who is dressed in all ten directions. That means He is present everywhere and can appear and disappear at His will. What are these ten directions? The eight directions you know: east, west, north, south, north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west, and up and down. So these are called the ten directions. Now He is present everywhere, in all directions, in all ten directions. This means, dressed with garments on ten sides, up and down. He is present everywhere and can appear and disappear at His will.

**Key Quote:** "So when Krishna appears, he becomes visible to us right in that place where he appears. And when he disappears, he becomes invisible."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Krishna's disappearance doesn't mean He leaves, but rather becomes invisible, and that He is present everywhere, but can only be seen when He gives darshan.

from everywhere and anywhere. Now, His disappearance from the side of child Parikhit does not mean that He appeared on the spot from any other place. He was present there, and even after disappearance, He was present there, although invisible to the eyes of the child. So when Krishna appears, He becomes visible to us right in that place where He appears, and when He disappears, He becomes invisible. He is there, present, because He is everywhere, but He becomes invisible. That's all. This material covering of the effulgent firmament, firmament in the sky, is also something like a womb of the Mother Nature, and we are put into the womb by the Lord, the Father of all living beings. So He is present everywhere, even in the material womb of Mother Durga, and those who are deserving can see the Lord. He is present wherever we have our awareness in the material world also. He is present, but we can see Him only when He gives darshan, when He becomes visible, not otherwise. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of Emperor Pariksit's birth and emphasizes his status as a pure devotee and the importance of following in the footsteps of such ideal devotees.

In this session, we will be discussing from the twelfth verse of the twelfth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Tata Sarva Gunodarke Sanukula Grahodaye Jagne Vamsadharapandur Bhuyapandur Ivaujasa. The meaning of this verse is, "Thereupon, when all the good signs of the zodiac gradually evolved, the heir apparent of Pandu, who would be exactly like him in prowess, took birth." So this is the chapter describing the birth of Emperor Pariksit. And his birth is very special because by birth he is a pure devotee. And that's the reason he was protected in the womb. He was protected in the womb by the love of his mother, by Krishna himself personally. And throughout his life, he was conducting himself as a pure devotee. So such pure devotees are directly coming from the spiritual world. They have got the purpose of life as the mission of the divine. And therefore, such personalities are described in Srimad Bhagavatam as ideal devotees whose footsteps we should all follow. So that we can also become pure devotees and perfect our lives very, very easily simply by following in their footsteps.

**Key Quote:** "Jyotir Veda, complete science, perfect science."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the astronomical circumstances of Pariksit's birth and emphasizes the factual basis of astronomy and astrology according to Srila Prabhupada, highlighting that these are complete and perfect sciences.

Now Pariksit's birth is happening in a very, very favorable astronomical situation. The birth itself is like that and Srila Prabhupada will explain the reason for the birth being very special. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Astronomical calculations of stellar influences upon a living being are not suppositions, but are factual as confirmed in Srimad Bhagavatam." There is a lot of speculation about what is astronomy, what is astrology, and what are the stars or the different heavenly bodies whose movements are basis of a calculation done in astronomy as well as in astrology. A chart is prepared and based on the chart a learned astrologer can read and actually tell many things about the person taking birth in a particular time, in a particular place under the influence of these stars or these heavenly bodies appearing in the sky. So, these calculations as Srila Prabhupada says here are factual. They are not some theories based on some speculation which are some sentimental people's belief systems. No, these are cent percent true and they are all factual. And it is based on a complete science, Jyotir Veda, complete science, perfect science.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Every action of life produces another reaction which is binding upon us."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that all living beings are controlled by the laws of nature and that every action produces a reaction, binding us to the material world, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "Every living being is controlled by the laws of nature at every minute." It is foolish to think that we are free, independent. We can do whatever we like. No, we cannot. There is some degree of freedom, but we have to act responsibly because there is control by the laws of nature every minute, just as a citizen is controlled by the influence of the state. Just like state laws are working, and if somebody is belonging to a particular state, he has to obey the laws. The state laws are grossly observed, but the laws of material nature being subtle to our gross understanding cannot be experienced grossly. How these influences are working, the astronomical influences, we cannot see with our eyes manifest in gross terms. As stated in the Bhagavad Gita, third chapter, ninth verse, "Every action of life produces another reaction which is binding upon us." Every action that we perform, every action has got a reaction according to the laws of nature, and that reaction is binding us to this material world. It is tying us down. We cannot escape the reaction. And it is also told in the same verse in the Bhagavad Gita, "Only those who are acting on behalf of Yajna or Vishnu are not bound by reactions."

**Key Quote:** "Only foolish, ignorant, arrogant, less intelligent, atheistic, demoniac people say there is no higher control."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees acting on behalf of Vishnu are not bound by reactions and that higher authorities judge our actions, awarding us bodies accordingly, contrasting this with the views of foolish and ignorant people.

So there is a special facility given to human beings who are performing actions on behalf of Vishnu, Yajna. Yajna arthat karma naha, it is called. Karma done, actions done, on behalf of Yajna, Yajna arthat. Such people, who are they? They are devotees, devotees of Vishnu, devotees of the Supreme Lord. They are not bound by reactions because they do all work on behalf of Vishnu. So our Srila Prabhupada further says, "Our actions are judged by the higher authorities who are the agents of the Lord, and thus we are awarded bodies according to our activities." So many living beings in so many varieties of bodies. What is the basis somebody is born in a particular type of body? The basis is the judgment of the higher authorities according to the work we have performed in the previous life. So there is a definite law working. There is a definite basis. There are enforcers of all these laws, and they are not visible to our eyes. They cannot be perceived with our gross senses. Only foolish, ignorant, arrogant, less intelligent, atheistic, demoniac people say there is no higher control. I don't believe in astronomy. I don't believe in astrology. I don't believe in scriptures. Only such foolish people talk nonsense, rubbish. And even as they are talking, they don't realize that even their movement of the tongue is controlled. Next moment such a foolish person gets a paralytic stroke. He can't talk. He can't move his limbs. He cannot even utilize his body at all, and he is simply admitted to some hospital or he lies in some place completely like a vegetable. And then he speaks all kinds of rubbish as long as he is able to vibrate his tongue. You see, this is the reality, and we see it all around us all the time. So, the fact is, the laws of nature are there. They are being enforced by the devatas, the agents of the Supreme Lord Krishna, and they are binding upon us. Nobody is exception.

**Key Quote:** "This astrological science is a great science. And misuse of a science does not make it useless."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the material body as a prison and emphasizes the importance of scriptures in enlightening us about this reality, further discussing astrology as a great science that is sometimes misused by quacks.

Nobody is exception. The laws of nature are so subtle that every part of our body is influenced by the respective stars, and a living being obtains his working body to fulfill his terms of imprisonment. We are very proud of the body that we have, but we don't realize that this body is a prison for the soul, the real I, real self, for me. It is a prison. It is limiting me in so many ways because we do not know as spirit-soul what is the kind of freedom I have. That I do not know. I am totally ignorant of that reality. So, therefore, the scriptures are enlightening us, educating us, informing us, warning us that you are imprisoned in your material body, and it has got a basis. Why? Why are you imprisoned? To fulfill the term of imprisonment imposed by the higher authorities according to a set of laws of nature which are working, perfectly working. The state laws may not be always imposed perfectly. Some, few people may escape the state law, but nobody can escape the laws of nature. So, a man's destiny is therefore ascertained by the bird-time constellation of stars, and a factual horoscope is made by a learned astrologer. It is a great science. This astrological science is a great science, and misuse of a science does not make it useless. In recent times, it has been misused, abused, and ignorant people sometimes do get cheated by bogus astrologers who do not know the science, and they make money out of misleading people. So, that doesn't mean the science is wrong or the science is not valid. It is the person who doesn't know the science who is cheating people. It is a quack who cheats people, not the learned, enlightened, authorized doctor. So, there is a difference between a quack and a doctor, a good doctor. Similarly, there is a difference between a learned astrologer and a bogus astrologer. There is a big difference and we have to learn that.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jaya Muthi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 13th verse of the 12th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, 12th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam: Tasyapreetamana Raja Vipraya Dhaumya Kripadibihi Jatakam Karayamasa Vachayitvacha Mangalam.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of samskaras as purificatory processes to remove material contamination and revive one's spiritual position.

So this is a Vedic tradition, Vedic culture. On the birth of a child, there is something called Jatakarma which is performed. It is one of the samskaras, purificatory processes. Purification by cultural method. The life of a human being in this material world is contaminated in so many ways. Material contamination is there. But if one becomes purified of all material contaminations, one revives his or her spiritual position. The spiritual process is the purification of the material contaminations. So this is a great science, it is called the Spiritual Science.

**Key Quote:** "varnashrama dharma is a scientific method of purification."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of varnashrama dharma and the role of qualified brahmanas in performing purificatory processes to create a good population.

And such samskaras, cultural purificatory processes, are employed for purifying the material contamination. So Yudhishthira was satisfied with the birth of Maharaj Pariksit, and he had the purificatory process performed, Jatakarma. So for such purification to happen, they take help of learned brahmanas who know the science, and they actually perform the purification by the proper method according to the science. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, there is a need for a good and intelligent class of brahmanas who are expert in performing the purificatory processes prescribed in the system of varnashrama dharma. Varnashrama dharma is a scientific method of purification, a system of practicing Dharma, religion, religious processes by which every human being can become purified of all material contamination and revive their spiritual position. Unless such purificatory processes are performed, there is no possibility of good population. How can we have a nice population, nice citizens, responsible, well-behaved, with good qualities, who know the aim of life, who are progressive in their thinking? How can we get such a population by performing such purificatory processes under the able guidance of the with the help of learned Brahmanas.

**Key Quote:** "in Kali yuga most of the population which is born from the human population is of the shudra quality means they are not having cultural purification"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that in Kali Yuga, most of the population is of Shudra quality due to the lack of purificatory processes and the scarcity of qualified brahmanas.

with the help of learned Brahma. In the age of Kali, the population all over the world is of Shudra quality or lower for want of this purificatory process. So in Kali yuga, according to the scriptures, kalava shudra sambhava aha, in Kali yuga most of the population which is born from the human population is of the shudra quality, means they are not having cultural purification. Now, shudra quality means they are not refined, they are not purified, why? Because there is no purificatory process for purifying the child which is born, why? Because there is this acute scarcity of learned brahmanas. So such learned brahmanas are not easily available in Kali Yuga. Some so called brahmanas by birth are there in Kali Yuga, but they are all bogus.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the nine qualifications of a Brahmana as mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing knowledge, realization, and faith.

Because they are not having qualification, neither they are learned in the Vedic sciences, nor their behavior, their conduct, their character is up to the standard of Brahmanical prescription in the Shastra. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is clearly said, a Brahmana is qualified in so many ways. At least nine distinct qualifications a Brahmana should have: Shamo, Damo, Tapaha, Shoucham, Shanti, Arjavam, Evacha, Gyanam, Vigyanam, Astikyam. Nine qualifications for a Brahmana mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita: Control of the mind, control of the senses, performing austerities, Tapasya, Shoucham, maintaining internal and external cleanliness, Shoucham, Shanti, tolerant, Arjavam is simple, is not duplicitous, straightforward, honest in all his dealings with everyone, Arjavam, Evacha, Gyanam is having proper knowledge, Vigyanam is having proper realization of that knowledge of the Vedas, and Astikyam has got faith in the Vedic scriptures, is not simply

reciting some hymns or verses like a parrot. No, he is learned, he knows the science, he is able to apply that science in his own life, guide others how to apply that science, he knows the reality, he knows the truth, and he has got faith, he is not faithless. He is not a blind follower, he is not a foolish person who actually is ignorant but poses as a Brahmana by cheating innocent people. Not such a Brahmana. So there is an acute scarcity of qualified, learned, gentle Brahmanas. Such Brahmanas are not there in Kali Yuga. It is not possible, however, to revive the Vedic process of purification in this age of Kali, but there is the Pancharatrika system also recommended for this age. See, this Varnashram. To revive that is very difficult in Kali Yuga because there are no proper facilities and there are no good Brahmanas to revive this.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The Pancharatrika system acts on the Shudra class of men."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Pancharatrika system is specifically meant for the Shudra class of people and is designed for spiritual upliftment.

But there is another system recommended in the scriptures that is called Pancharatrika system specially for Kali Yuga. The Pancharatrika system acts on the Shudra class of men, supposedly the population of Kali Yuga. So Pancharatrika is specially meant for the Shudra class of people, those who are born without cultural purification, without samskara. Such people, they can take advantage of the Pancharatrika system. And in this Pancharatrika system, there is a prescribed purificatory process suitable for this age and the present time. You see, this is the arrangement of the Supreme Lord Krishna for us in Kali Yuga when there is a scarcity of Brahmanas, when there is no cultural purification happening before the birth of a child. Such a purification or purificatory process as prescribed in the Pancharatrika system is allowed only for spiritual purification, for spiritual upliftment and not for any other purpose. See, the purpose is also very clearly explained in the scriptures. Why this Pancharatrika system is given when already the scriptures describe a Varanashrama Dharma system? Why? Because it is necessary for spiritual upliftment of the population through this Pancharatrika method.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual upliftment is never conditioned by higher or lower parentage."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that spiritual upliftment is not dependent on parentage and that the Pancharatrika system can purify anyone regardless of their background.

Which is possible that anyone from any kind of background can be uplifted to the spiritual platform directly without going through the complicated procedures of the Varanashrama system. Spiritual upliftment is never conditioned by higher or lower parentage. See, Srila Prabhupada explained a very, very, very important point. If somebody is born without samskara or samskruta, culturally not refined, but irrespective of what is the status of the parents or the family in which one takes birth, one can be uplifted spiritually by the Pancharatrika system.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Before a child is conceived, the very first samskara is called Garbhadana samskara."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of Garbhadana samskara, the purification process before conception, which is often missing in Kali Yuga.

This is the method of purification. After the Garbhadana purificatory process, there are certain other samskaras like Seeman Tonnayana, Sardh Bhakshana, etc. During the period of pregnancy and when the child is born, the first purificatory process is Jatakarma. See, before a child is conceived, the very first samskara is called Garbhadana samskara. Or, the parents combine to conceive a child by themselves purifying their consciousness of material contamination by observing their child, by observing certain specific practices. Now, that is missing in Kali Yuga. Garbhadana samskara is missing. They do not even know about it, that they can have a child with a good background if they are able to perform this Garbhadana samskara. They themselves become purified before they combine for conceiving a child. It's not accidental. It's not by chance some child is born to some parents. No. It is a complete science. What kind of child you want, accordingly there is a prescription in the scriptures.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the eternal nature of the soul and the importance of Jatakarma samskara performed by expert brahmanas, referencing Yudhishthira and Parikshit Maharaj as an example.

How parents can actually have a child with a good background. Because life is continuous. It's not that life begins at birth and ends at death. No. It's the soul who is eternal, who is accepting a particular type of body. So, Maharaj Yudhishthira, with the help of good and learned Brahmanas, like Dhaumya and Kripacharya, performed this Jatakarma samskara for Parikshit Maharaj. And it is described here that these two Brahmanas, Dhaumya and Kripacharya, were very learned, and they properly performed that samskara because of which the child was properly purified. Cultural purification of the child happened because of these two expert Brahmanas performing the Jatakarma samskara. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

Hiranyam Gaam Mahim Gramaan Hasti Ashwaan Nirupatir Varan Pradat Svannam Chavipre Bhyaha Prajaatirthesa Tirthavit. The meaning of this verse is: Upon the birth of his son, the king, who knew how, where, and when charity should be done, gave gold, land, villages, elephants, horses, and good food grains to the brahmanas. Particularly in this verse, it is said, Prajaatirthesa Tirthavit. On the occasion of giving in charity on the birth of his son, Yudhishthira Maharaj gave charity because he knew Tirthavit. He knew how to give charity, to whom charity should be given, and when it should be given.

**Key Quote:** "Dana or charity or dakshina only given to brahmanas and sannyasis for the spiritual service they render to service spiritual service they render to the society free of charge"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's perspective that charity (dana/dakshina) is specifically meant for brahmanas and sannyasis who provide spiritual service without charge, emphasizing that this is different from helping the poor.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, "Only the brahmanas and sannyasis are authorized to accept charity from the householders. Only the brahmanas and sannyasis are authorized to accept charity from the householders, especially from the householders." And only the brahmanas and sannyasis in the Varna Shtrama System can accept charity. It doesn't say scriptures don't prescribe poorer people should be given charity. No. That is not the correct understanding. Dana, or charity, or dakshina, is only given to brahmanas and sannyasis for the spiritual service they render to the society free of charge. The dakshina that is given, or dana that is given to a brahmana or sannyasi, is not a prescribed charge for the services rendered. No, there is no such prescription anywhere in the scriptures. Neither a brahmana will ever ask that you give me this much fees for some consultation or for some service I may render. No, never, never. So, this is very culture, you see. The best of the service is regarding giving advice, giving guidance, giving any help in any way to conduct a sacrifice, or to worship the Lord, or to prepare an horoscope, or to do any of these brahmanical activities, or to teach the Vedas. Never will a brahmana charge anyone who seeks the services of a brahmana. Never, never will he charge. So, then how do they maintain themselves? This is the way they are given dakshina, they are given dana by the householders without any consideration of how much the householders are benefiting, how much service they're taking. No, no such consideration. So, it is said here specifically...

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of giving charity to qualified brahmanas, highlighting their role in providing spiritual upliftment and welfare to society.

In all the different occasions of samskaras, especially during the time of birth, marriage, and death, wealth is distributed to the brahmanas because the brahmanas give the highest quality of service in regard to the prime necessity of humankind. What is the prime necessity of a human being? Spiritual upliftment, spiritual elevation, progress towards the ultimate goal of life. In that regard, the brahmanas are giving the highest quality of service because such service is not ordinarily possible to be obtained from anyone else other than qualified, learned brahmanas who are engaged in tapasya, who are engaged in constantly worshipping the Lord, in constantly studying the scriptures, in constantly performing welfare activity for the entire human society. Not only human society, for the entire world, of all living creatures. Foolish people don't understand this. So, such brahmanas deserve to get dakshina, dana, especially during three occasions: birth, marriage, and death.

**Key Quote:** "They lived a simple life, even though they had, in the form of dakshina or dana, all these things which are given, but they never made a show of that, neither they exploited."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how brahmanas, although receiving substantial charity, lived simple lives dedicated to the well-being of society, without exploiting their position.

It must be given. The charity was substantial in the shape of gold, land, villages, horses, elephants, and food grains, with other materials for cooking, complete foodstuff. So, the brahmanas were not, therefore, poor in the actual sense of the term. Proper qualified brahmanas were properly given charity. They were not exactly poor, though they would never make a show of wealth. They never made a show of wealth. They lived a simple life, even though they had, in the form of dakshina or dana, all these things which are given, but they never made a show of that, neither they exploited the system to become very, very rich and become extravagant in spending, or simply indulge in sense-enjoyment with dana or dakshina that they received. No, never. On the other hand, they'll be always austere in their mode of living. Tapasya. And they'll be simple and straightforward in all their dealings. And they'll be very benevolent to the general people in society. Always willing to do welfare activity for everyone in the society. Because they possessed gold, land, villages, horses, elephants, and sufficient grains, they had nothing to earn for themselves. There was no need for them to earn some money for their own maintenance. They would simply devote themselves to the well-being of the entire society. See, so nice a system. That somebody is fully devoted for the welfare of the society, and they don't have to bother to find out some means of earning some money for their own maintenance. Their maintenance is taken care of, and they simply give very good service to the whole society, everyone.

**Key Quote:** "Charity has got a purpose. Giving charity is purposefully given."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of giving charity with purpose, considering the place, time, and recipient, as outlined in the scriptures, and contrasts this with the commercialization of services in Kali Yuga.

Now, the word that is used here, Tirthavit, is significant in this verse because the king, that is Yudhishthira Maharaj, knew well where and when charity has to be given. Yudhishthira Maharaj was aware. He was enlightened. He was Raja Rishi. He was a saintly king. So, he knew when and where charity has to be given. Charity is never unproductive or brutal. Charity has got a purpose. Giving charity is purposefully given, and it is given with due consideration of who is the person who is to be given charity, and when it is to be given, and where should it be given. The place, the time, the candidate for receiving charity, all these are very clearly explained in the scriptures. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is said that charity should be given in the mode of goodness. Mode of goodness means following the scriptures. It is regulated. Only brahmanas and sannyasis should be given charity, and these brahmanas and sannyasis do accept charity because they don't have any other means of livelihood for their maintenance. They have no other job or profession or work or some income or some wealth. They don't have anything like that. And whatever service they give, they give it free of charge, always. In this case, anyone who comes needs some service, they give it free of charge, totally free, 100% free. Never there is any consideration of charges.

**Key Quote:** "But Vedic culture is, brahmanas are never commercially oriented."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic system of taxation, where only Vaishyas (businessmen) were taxed, and the collected taxes were used by Kshatriyas for the welfare and protection of all citizens, while brahmanas were exempt.

That is a true brahmana, a true sannyas. So, Kali Yuga, we only know that people who are expert in some field of learning, they have fees, they charge fees, professional fees. And the government collects taxes on those fees. So, it has become what we can say as commercial, a commercial venture. But Vedic culture is, brahmanas are never commercially oriented. Neither the government or the king would charge any tax on the brahmanas. Never brahmanas are taxed. Kshatriyas will tax only Vaishyas who are business minded. Only Vaishyas are taxed, and Kshatriyas don't collect taxes from other Kshatriyas, and Kshatriyas don't collect any tax from brahmanas and sutras. So, only Vaishyas are the ones who give taxes, and only the Kshatriyas collect such taxes to engage in welfare activity for the whole society. For all the citizens, welfare of the citizens, they collect taxes, and in return, they give protection to the citizens, and they ensure that the society is properly maintained. The common facilities for the people in the state or the kingdom are properly maintained.

#### charity, daridra narayana, compassion, daya

**Key Quote:** "A needy person should be shown compassion. Daya. Not Dana. Not Dakshina."
**Summary:** The speaker refutes the concept of 'Daridra Narayana' (poor Narayana), clarifying that charity (dana) is meant for spiritually enlightened individuals, while the poor should be shown compassion (daya) and helped with basic needs.

So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "In the Shastras, charity was offered to persons who deserve to accept charity, but didn't have spiritual enlightenment." You see, who can receive charity? One who is spiritually enlightened, whether it's a brahmana or a sanyasi. Both of them are supposed to be spiritually enlightened. And nowadays, what goes on in the name of Daridra Narayana, Srila Prabhupada says, "The so-called Daridra Narayana, a misconception of the Supreme Lord by unauthorized persons, is never to be found in the Shastras as the object of charity." Daridra means somebody who is poverty stricken, and a poverty stricken person sometimes is designated wrongly as Daridra Narayana. Narayana is never Daridra, and a Daridra can never become Narayana. So, this is completely wrong. Combining these two terms and designating some poor people as object of charity wrongly is a total misconception because the Supreme Lord is always having unlimited opulences. By definition, Bhagavan. Bhaga means opulences. Vaan means one who possesses. And to what extent? Unlimited. And a poverty stricken man is poverty stricken because of his sinful past. So, never consider a poverty stricken man as Narayana. So, there is a difference between giving charity to spiritually enlightened persons and helping some poor people who may be needy. There is a difference between the two. A needy person should be shown compassion. Daya. Not Dana. Not Dakshina. What is called Daya. Daya means you want to help somebody who is in need because you have the means to share. You have little excess, so you share it with somebody who is in need. That is called Daya, compassion. It is not Dana. Don't confuse the two. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker explains verses 15 and 16 of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the Brahmanas' description of Parikshit's birth and Lord Vishnu's protection.

In this session we will be discussing from the 15th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, the 16th verse, and the 16th verses of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. To begin with the 15th verse: Tam Uchur Brahmanas Tushta Rajanam Prashrayanvitam Esha Hyasmin Prajatantau Purunam Paura Varshabha. The meaning of this 15th verse is: The learned Brahmanas who were very satisfied with the charities of the king addressed him as the chief amongst the Purus and informed him that his son was certainly in the line of descent from the Purus. So the learned Brahmanas are describing that the child which is born in this dynasty is actually a very, very fortunate child and deserving to take birth in this glorious dynasty, is going to only increase the glories of this dynasty in which great people had appeared earlier. So the next verse, 16th verse, daivena apratighatena shukle samstham upeyushi ratovo anugraharthaya vishtuna prabhavishtuna. The meaning of this verse is: the brahmanas said this potless son has been restored by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Lord Vishnu, the personality of Godhead, in order to oblige you, brahmanas speaking to Yudhishthira. So in order to oblige Yudhishthira, this child has been protected by the Supreme Lord personally. He was saved when he was doomed to be destroyed by an irresistible supernatural weapon.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord wants to continue the line of pious kings to rule over the earth as his representatives for the actual progress of a peaceful and prosperous life."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the two reasons why Lord Vishnu saved Parikshit: his spotless nature as a pure devotee and his role as the sole surviving male descendant of the Puru dynasty, essential for continuing the Lord's mission of spiritual upliftment.

The history you have heard before is described by Prabhupada in the purport. The child Pariksit was saved by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Vishnu or Lord Krishna for two reasons. So specifically Prabhupada is citing two reasons why this child was saved. When it was attacked by that irresistible supernatural weapon, Brahmastra, the child was saved by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Vishnukara of Lord Krishna's seenives, it is the... the impossibility to've grass from the temple, or even the ultraviolet up pen, or even the entre Integration between the dreams of Sun and moon. And it's Vorabhadopinakay Av приход,лиз If this suratimes on Lord Vishnu was released, of Vishnu had not been provoke by this yanlış, it would certainly have 贸 a mother itself. But because the child was protected personally by Lord Vishnu the child did not die. So why it was saved by Vishnu, two reasons. The first reason is that the child in the womb of the mother was spotless due to his being a pure devotee of the Lord. So there is no ordinary child spotless pure because pure devotee of the Supreme Lord means there is no material contamination, there is no past karma, sinful reactions, nothing, spotless child and that is described here shukle samstha mupe yushi, shukle means pure, the child is pure, spotless. The second reason, there is a second reason why the child was saved by the Supreme God personally. The second reason is that the child was the only surviving male descendant of Puru, the pious forefather of the virtuous King Yudhishthira. In this dynasty where great personalities had appeared and they were doing excellent service to the society of protecting the citizens by ruling exactly according to scriptural directions and elevating the people to the spiritual platform, spiritual upliftment of the people in the society. They were doing that work very nicely. So in order to further the mission of the Supreme Lord in this material world, which is spiritual upliftment of the people, these kings in this Puru dynasty, all the forefathers of Yudhishthira and Yudhishthira himself, all had actually done excellent service in the mission of the Supreme Lord in this world. And this child was the only surviving male descendant because everyone else was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. All of them were killed in the battle of Kurukshetra.

All the other descendants were killed in the battle. So therefore this child was the only surviving descendant and had to be saved. So Srila Prabhupada further says, the Lord wants to continue the line of pious kings to rule over the earth as his representatives for the actual progress of a peaceful and prosperous life. Lord has got a certain plan. He was supposed to candy the people after themselves and give them the privilege of the material world. Even though and the spiritual world and that is his actual personal abode, but this material world which is created for the sake of foolish rebellious living beings who want to enjoy materially against their constitutional position.540 7 Pour singer.4 hillrint for themౄм Lord creates his material world.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Vishnu as a plenary expansion of Krishna, possessing full power, and defines a pure devotee as one who renders devotional service without material desires or expectations.

Lord Krishna is described here as Vishnu and this is also significant. Why? Lord Krishna, the original personality of Godhead, does the work of protection and annihilation in his capacity of Vishnu. Krishna incarnates in this world as Vishnu for the purpose of creation, maintenance, destruction of this material world. So protection is done by him. The destruction is also done by Vishnu. Lord Krishna is also the utilized weapon used by human иг Jumping into испgie, B..., overalnbeing as only child of grave evil, to immediately take is or to came sel at golden bringer of the swords of жизнь. So Lord Vishnu is the plenary expansion of Lord Krishna. Plenary expansion means he's expansion who's having the full power. The expansion has Vishnu. Vishnu has full power of Krishna. Vishnu is no second different person now. He is Krishna himself in another form for a specific purpose for the specific function was Krishna is the unlimited Lord he can be present simultaneously in different forms for different purposes different functions different specific purposes so that is Krishna's opulence as Krishna's all-powerful personality the all-pervasive activities of the Lord are executed by him in his vishnu feature o parism present everywhere so Krishna has to be present everywhere then Krishna expands his vishnu and as Vishnu he is everywhere child parikshit is described here spotlessly by Shukla because he is an unalloyed devotee of the Lord unalloyed devotee means pure devotee meaning of pure devotee a devotee who does not have any material desires a devotee who does not render devotional service with any material motive a devotee who does not render devotional service with any expectation

**Summary:** The speaker describes the Lord's mission to reclaim conditioned souls, highlighting the role of transcendental literature, missionaries, and spiritual masters in guiding them back to Godhead, and emphasizing the Lord's protection of pure devotees.

of in return for the service from Krishna such a devotee is a pure devotee unalloyed devotee such an alloyed devotee is of the Lord appear on the earth just to execute the mission of the Lord and what is the mission of the Lord the Lord desires the conditioned souls hovering in the material creation to be reclaimed go back home back to godhead lord wants us to go back to his person above because that's where we belong and we have a relationship with the lord so he wants us back thus he helps them by preparing the transcendental literatures like the vedas see how many ways krishna helps the living entities in this world who are stuck up here entangled by preparing transcendental literatures like the vedas which describe everything about who we are what is the way of getting out of the entanglement what are the process who can help everything is given in the vedas by sending missionaries of saints and sages you see the saintly persons they preach they enlighten they explain on behalf of lord to the ignorant people and by deputing his representative the spiritual master Guru, Sadhu, Shastra. Three ways in which the Supreme Lord helps the conditioned souls. Such transcendental literatures, missionaries and representatives of the Lord are spotlessly white because the contamination of material qualities cannot even touch them. So, Shastras are perfect. The Acharyas, the previous Acharyas, the saintly persons, they are pure and the spiritual master also is a pure devotee or should be a pure devotee. Not anybody else can be spiritual master. They are always protected by the Lord when they are threatened with annihilation. Pure devotees are always protected by the Lord personally. And the gross materialists, they sometimes threaten such pure devotees. But they cannot do anything. They cannot do anything to the pure devotees because the Lord personally protects them. So, that's the explanation why Parikshit was saved. He is a pure devotee. So, he is personally protected by the Supreme Lord and he was saved.

#### Protection by the Lord, Qualities of a pure devotee, Grades of devotees

**Key Quote:** "All the good qualities can only be found in the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the protection offered by the Lord to pure devotees, contrasting it with the protection offered to others, and introduces the three grades of devotees: Mahabhagavata, Madhyama Adhikari, and Kanishtha Adhikari.

In this session we will be discussing from the 17th verse of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The birth of Emperor Parikshit. तस्मान नामना विष्णु राता इति लोके भविष्यती नसंदेहो महाभाग महाभागवतो महान। So this verse is describing the reason why this child will be well known throughout the world. So the translation of this verse: For this reason the child will be well known in the world as one who is protected by the personality of Godhead. That's the meaning of the word Vishnurata. O most fortunate one! The brahmanas are addressing King Yudhishthira. There is no doubt that this child will become a first-class devotee and will be qualified with all good qualities. Mahabhagavato: A first-class devotee, topmost devotee, pure devotee. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this point very elaborately. Srila Prabhupada says, "The Lord gives protection to all living beings because he is their supreme leader. The Vedic hymns confirm that the Lord is the supreme person amongst all personalities. Nithyao Nithyanaam Chetanas Chetananaam." The difference between the two living beings is that the one, the personality of Godhead, provides for all living beings. All other living beings and by knowing him, one can achieve eternal peace. Eko Bahunam Yo Viddhati Kaman: The one, only one, supreme personality of Godhead. He provides for everyone else. And anybody who knows this personality of Godhead, the provider of everyone, the chief, the topmost personality, the supreme person, will attain eternal peace. Such protection is given by his different potencies to different grades of living beings. There are various potencies of the Supreme Lord that are working, always working in his service. And they provide different grades. Different grades of living beings get different protection. But as far as his unalloyed devotees are concerned, unalloyed means pure devotees, the first class devotees, he gives the protection personally. There is a difference. The living entities who are not pure devotees, they are given protection through arrangement of the Supreme Lord through his different potencies or energies. But when it comes to pure devotees, Krishna personally protects them. Therefore, Maharaj Pariksit is protected from the very beginning of his appearance in the womb of his mother. Krishna is always taken personally. And then they are always under the personal charge of his pure devotees. Always, they are under his personal protection. And because he is especially given protection by the Lord, the indication must be concluded that the child would be a first grade devotee of the Lord with all good qualities. All the good qualities can only be found in the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees.

#### Kanishtha Adhikari (Materialistic Devotee), Madhyama Adhikari (Intermediate Devotee), Devotee Interactions

**Key Quote:** "Secondly, the devotees who have developed, the second class of devotees, the devotees who have developed a mentality of genuine service to the Lord, and who thus make friendships only with similar devotees, show favor to the neophytes and avoid the atheists, are called the second grade... the second grade devotees."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the characteristics of the Kanishtha Adhikari, focusing on their limited understanding and lack of respect for devotees, and then describes the Madhyama Adhikari, highlighting their genuine service mentality and differentiated interactions with others based on their spiritual advancement.

There are three grades of devotees, namely the Mahabhagavata, Madhyama Adhikari and the Kanishtha Adhikari, three grades. The topmost is the Mahabhagavata, intermediate level of devotion is the Madhyama Adhikari, intermediate level, and Kanishtha Adhikari, the lowest level, the neophyte devotee. Now Srila Prabhupada explains this, three grades of devotees. Those who go to the temples of the Lord and offer worshipful respect to the devotees, the deity, without sufficient knowledge in the theological science, and therefore without any respect for the devotees of the Lord, are called materialistic devotees or Kanishtha Adhikari, the third grade devotees, the lowest, the third grade devotees. Prakrita Bhakta, this is Sanskrit, Prabhupada translates that in English as materialistic devotees. So their conception of God is God is only in the temple and in the form of a deity. And they offer respect, they don't have proper understanding of the science, theological science, science concerning God. They don't have sufficient knowledge. And therefore, they don't have any respect for the devotees of the Lord. Their attitude is like, I am there, God is there, that's all. And what about the others? They are also there, God is there, between them and God, between me and God, that's all. Nothing to do with interpersonal exchange between different persons. Secondly, the devotees who have developed, the second class of devotees, the devotees who have developed a mentality of genuine service to the Lord, and who thus make friendships only with similar devotees, show favor to the neophytes and avoid the atheists, are called the second grade devotees. The second grade devotees, madhyama adhikari, intermediate level devotees, the second grade devotees, they recognize four classes of people in this world. The topmost, of course, four classes of personalities, I would say. First of all, they have the highest respect for the Supreme Lord. And then, they make friendship with others who are devotees, engaged in proper devotional service. And then, they are kind, and they show favor to the neophyte devotees, the beginners. And they avoid the atheists, and the agnostics, and the materialists, hardcore materialists. They avoid them. So, four categories of treatment, for four categories of personalities.

#### Mahabhagavata (Topmost Devotee), Seeing the Lord Everywhere, Everything Belongs to God

**Key Quote:** "But those who see everything in the Lord, or everything of the Lord... this is the vision of a pure devotee."
**Summary:** This segment describes the qualities of the Mahabhagavata, emphasizing their ability to see everything in relation to the Lord and use everything in His service, clarifying that seeing the Lord everywhere doesn't mean everything is God, but rather that everything belongs to God.

This is the second grade devotee. They have developed a genuine service mentality. That means they are properly engaged, under guidance, under clear guidance, in devotional service of the Supreme Lord. And they are in knowledge. They have proper knowledge of who is God, who is a devotee, who are the neophytes, who are the atheists. They have clear knowledge, clear understanding. Then, the first grade devotee. This is now described by Prabhupada. But those who see everything in the Lord, or everything of the Lord, two different things. But this is the vision of a pure devotee. And also see in everything, an eternal relation of the Lord. It may sound like difficult to understand, but the fact is, in the whole existence, the Lord is there, and His energies are there. And the Lord is the possessor, owner, and enjoyer, and controller of all His energies. So the energies belong to the Lord. But in another sense, the Lord and His energy are not different. So, because the Lord and His energy are not different, therefore, a pure devotee sees everything in the Lord, and sees everything belonging to the Lord. Everything belongs to the Lord. And also, anything we take, it has a specific relationship with the Lord. It has a specific relationship. Now, based on this understanding of relationship, the treatment for that thing will also be different. Each item, each thing. It's not the same treatment for everything. Now, such pure devotees, for them, there is nothing within their purview of sight except the Lord. They see the Lord everywhere. Now, seeing the Lord everywhere doesn't mean that everything is God. No. Everything is not God. God is God. Everything belongs to God. Everything is God's property, is God's proprietorship. So, everything has to be used in God's service. Everything belongs to God, so use everything in God's service. So, because they recognize everything belonging to God, therefore, they only see God. Very simple way to put it is, they don't see just the creation, they see the creator. Creation means there is a creator, and creation also means they can see the creator everywhere. It's a consciousness that is saturated with God. So, they are fully God conscious, fully Krishna conscious. And they are called the Mahabhagavatas, or the first great devotees of the Lord. Such first great devotees of the Lord are perfect in all respects. A devotee who may be in any of these categories is automatically qualified by all good qualities. And thus, a Mahabhagavata devotee like Maharaj Pariksit

is certainly perfect in all respects. And because Maharaj Pariksit took his birth in the family of Maharaj Yudhishtira, he is addressed here in this Mahabhagavata, the greatest of fortunates. The family in which a Mahabhagavata takes his birth is fortunate because due to the first great devotee taking birth in the family, in a particular family, the members of the family, past, present and future, up to 100 generations, become liberated by the grace of the Lord out of respect for his beloved devotees. So, that is the greatest thing that can happen to anybody. So, the greatest service one can do to one's family is simply to become a pure devotee of Krishna. That's all. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna. So, that's the explanation why Pariksit was saved. He is a pure devotee. So, he is personally protected by the Supreme God who saved him. And that's how, actually, this Pariksit was born as the only surviving descendant of the royal dynasty. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, all the members of the state, all the citizens, were happy, pious, well-behaved, prosperous, and spiritually enlightened."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the qualities of saintly kings (Rajarshis) and the positive impact they have on their citizens.

So this verse is a question. This is a question by King Yudhishthira to the Brahmins. So Shri La Pravapara explains in the purport to this verse. The forefathers of King Yudhishthira were all great saintly kings. Rajarsheen. The term used is Rajarsheen. They are Raja, they are kings, but they are also Rishi, they are saintly, saintly kings. It's a rare combination. And all of them are pious and glorified by their great achievements. They are all pious, because they strictly follow the scriptures, and they are glorified by their great achievements. Their achievements are noteworthy, even for kings. They are future generations. So they are all recorded in the Vedic scriptures. And they are glorified, and their example is cited again and again and again. They are the ideal for everyone else in the society, even in future. So their example is a timeless example. They don't go out of relevance, because there may be some very ancient examples of a different time, of a different era. Because the nature of a person is essentially spiritual, and that spiritual nature doesn't change with the change of time, change of era, change of yuga, change of place, change of circumstances. The spiritual nature does not change. So further Srila Prabhupada says, they were all saints on the royal throne. They are sitting on the royal throne. They are ruling. They are powerful. And they can be very, very tough in dealing with miscreants. But they are saints. They have all the qualities of a sadhu, of a saintly person. And therefore, as a result of such people ruling, what is being described here, please hear. Therefore, all the members of the state, all the citizens, were happy, pious, well-behaved, prosperous, and spiritually enlightened.

**Summary:** The lecture details five benefits citizens receive under the rule of saintly kings: happiness, piousness, good behavior, prosperity, and spiritual enlightenment.

Five things Prabhupada says about the citizens who are under the care of great saintly kings, Rajarshis. First of all, people are happy. This is a primary characteristic of a saintly person ruling a kingdom, or a state, or a province, or a country, or even the whole world. All the people are happy. Why? Because of his perfect rule, there is plenty of supply of all necessities by Mother Earth. Plenty of supply. So there is no scarcity of anything, for anyone. So naturally people will be happy. And then people are also, they are pious, because the saintly kings enforce the scriptural directions to be followed by everybody for their own good, for the good of the whole country, for the good of the whole world. So there are no clashes between different sections of people in the society. People can live in harmony, peacefully. And because of the prosperity, they are all happy. Everyone is having everything they require. And people are well behaved. They are well behaved because they are all trained up to follow their respective duties, to perform their respective duties. Everyone is trained up in the Vedic culture. The whole society is divided into four social classes and four spiritual classes.

**Key Quote:** "So the four social classes are the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the four social classes in Vedic culture (Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) and their respective duties and contributions to society.

So the four social classes are the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. So they have a certain nature, acquired nature. Accordingly, they are trained and they are engaged in occupational duties. So everyone contributes to the society positively. And the others acknowledge, I may be inclined to work like a Brahmana. So I give my contribution to the society in terms of giving guidance to the people, in terms of educating them, in terms of teaching them how to worship God, in terms of giving them guidance about their own responsibilities, duties, like that. So, I do my duty and the Kshatriyas, they do their duty giving protection to the citizens, collecting taxes, spending the tax money for the public welfare. Then the Vaishyas, they do economic development by trading, commerce, by growing food grains, by giving cow protection, so plenty of milk, milk products, plenty of grains, plenty of minerals, everything. The Vaishyas cultivate the land, they engage in business, trading the excess grains or excess silk or excess of metals, minerals, everything. So, the Vaishyas do their work, they give taxes to the government and the government spends it for public welfare. The Shudras are engaged according to their proclivities to do a particular type of menial work because they cannot work as a Vaishya or a Kshatriya or a Brahmana. They don't have the necessary intellectual development. Their nature is not suited for using their intelligence in a Vaishya way or a Kshatriya way or a Brahmana way. So, they just are humble, they do whatever they can do as menial service and even for that they are trained up, even in that menial service they are trained up like carpenters, sculptors, the tillers in the land, or the workers who work in a Goshala or workers who work in the in the government, in the military. They are trained up to do one specific type of work without trying to use their intelligence in in in understanding some philosophy or some theory, nothing, they just follow. That is the level of the Shudra. And they are provided with all their needs, they are provided with all their needs by whoever engages them in a respective menial service.

**Key Quote:** "People are well behaved because they are trained up, they are taught and they have ideals in the society, the saintly persons, the brahmanas, and the rishis, the sages."
**Summary:** The lecture continues to explain how citizens are well-behaved, prosperous, and spiritually enlightened under saintly rule, emphasizing the importance of spiritual knowledge and Bhagavata Dharma.

So, in this way people are well behaved, people are well behaved because they are trained up, they are taught and they have ideals in the society, the saintly persons, the brahmanas, and the rishis, the sages. They have ideal examples to follow and people are prosperous because they have plenty of everything. There is no scarcity. Why? Because Mother Nature provides, Mother Earth provides. When there is a saintly person, a saintly king ruling, Mother Earth provides plenty. Everybody does their duty, therefore there is yajña, yajña karma samudbhava. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita. And, above all, people are spiritually enlightened. There is systematic dissemination of spiritual knowledge, which is most essential in human society. It cannot be like the government is not concerned with people's spiritual development. No. Government should be concerned. Should be concerned. People should understand that they are not the body or at least even if they don't understand philosophically, they should follow the scriptural directions for spiritual advancement by performing some spiritual activity, by performing some spiritual activity. They should. Everyone should. That is not a matter of somebody's belief system. Spiritual life is not a matter of belief system. So, everybody has to understand there is only one supreme Lord. And, everyone else other than the supreme Lord is actually under the control of the one and only one supreme Lord. There is no question of different religious faiths. They say there are different religions in the world because there are different religions. There are different religions in the world because there are different religions in the world. There are different religions in the world because there are different religious faiths. This is a misunderstanding of what is eternal religion. It's called Bhagavata Dharma. That's what Bhagavatam proclaims. And, a king actually enforces Bhagavata Dharma. A Rajarshi introduces or enforces Bhagavata Dharma. Universal. Universal system of Dharma. Religion.

It is not dependent on people's faith. No. Just like all human beings. Why human beings? Even all living creatures. They require food. And, who provides the food? The supreme Lord. The one and only one supreme Lord provides the food for every living being. So, this is universal Dharma. Universal Dharma. So, this way the Rajarshi enforces Bhagavata Dharma. And, this way people become spiritually enlightened. So, this is being mentioned by Yudhishthira Maharaj that all the forefathers of Yudhishthira Maharaj in this dynasty were all great personalities. Now, will this child also be as great as those forefathers of our dynasty? That's the question he's asking.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the eternal nature of the soul, its separation from the Lord due to material desires, and the awarding of a material body to fulfill those desires.

So, in a very elaborate purport by Srila Prabhupada for this verse. Maharaj asked a question, will he be as glorious as his forefathers in his dynasty? So the Brahmanas replied, yes, he will have all the good qualities of all the great persons and that will be described in the next 10 to 15 verses of this chapter. So very, very promising child has taken birth as the grandson of Arjuna, the only surviving descendant of the Kuru dynasty. Everyone else has died in the battle of Kurukshetra. So a very qualified and exceptionally great personality has taken birth because this is a person's birth. pure devotee taken birth and it's a lord's arrangement for the good of this entire world so srila prabhupada elaborately explains in the purport praja means the living being who has taken his birth in this material world praja actually the living being has no birth and no death but because of his separation from the service of the lord and due to his desire to lord it over material nature he is offered a suitable body to satisfy his material desires so a very fundamental understanding of who we are and we are actually spirit soul spirit soul does not have birth does not have death the soul itself is not born or does not die but it is the body body has got birth and body has got death and this body is awarded to us to the spirit soul particular spirit soul to satisfy the material desires of the spirit soul.

**Key Quote:** "Spirit soul does not belong to material world spirit soul belongs to the spiritual world"
**Summary:** The lecture continues to elaborate on the soul's misplaced position in the material world, driven by the desire to dominate, and how this leads to the transmigration of the soul through various bodies based on karma.

The soul and material desires don't go together actually, but because we are separated from the service of the lord, why are we separated from the service of the lord? Because we want to desire to lord over material nature, we want to enjoy materially. So this is the reason we are placed in the material world where we don't belong. Spirit soul does not belong to material world, spirit soul belongs to the spiritual world. But then in this material world, if a spirit soul has to live in the material world, spirit soul has to get a material body, only then we can live in the material world, we can attempt to lord over material nature, we can attempt to satisfy material desires. So therefore, Shloka Prabha says the spirit soul, the actual person, the living being is offered a suitable body. So the varieties of bodies are there. In doing so, one becomes conditioned by the laws of material nature and the material body is changed in terms of his own work. Condition means we are subject to the control, the influence of material nature. We cannot act in any way different from the influence and whatever work we do exactly according to that work we get our next body. So if our work is possible we can move it, we can change it and we can change the world in terms of devotional service, we get a spiritual body, we revive our spiritual form. Otherwise if you don't do devotional service, we keep changing our body according to our work in different species in different places or planets in different the living entity thus transmigrates from one body to another in 8 million 400 thousand species of

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of transmigration, comparing it to the continuous changes within a single lifetime, emphasizing that the body is constantly changing even though we perceive it as the same.

life. Transmigration, that means we are changing body, but we don't appear to be changing body, especially when in this very body, in this very life, what we understand is life between birth and death. In this life, we are changing body from childhood to youth to old age, but we are not thinking that our body is changing, we think our body is growing, we think our body is the same body which is become bigger or which has become older, but that's not a fact. The body is material and matter doesn't grow. For example, this table, will this table ever grow? No, never. Nothing material ever grows. So therefore, this body appears to grow, but because it is material it will not grow, it doesn't grow. Then what happens? I was a child, now I have somebody has a body of a youth and I had a body of old man. So what happened actually? The old body we give up to accept a new body and this happens in such a way that we don't realize that continuously, changes are taking place in this body. After all, this body is made up of so many cells, right? And some cells are dying and they are replaced with new cells. Old cells are replaced with new cells.

**Key Quote:** "So, nature has actually fashioned 8,400,000 types of bodies."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the variety of bodies available in different species, explaining that each body is suited to fulfill specific desires for enjoyment.

Continuously, this is happening. And it's so very gradual. If you are continuously in touch with another person, we don't notice how the person is changing body. We don't notice that. And as long as there is a resemblance between one body, the previous state of my body and the next stage of my body, because there is a resemblance, we think, oh, the same person, same body. Same person, yes, but not the same body. It's not the same body. It's a similar body. It's a similar body. So, therefore, this is called transmigration. Dehantara. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is explained. Dehino samsara. So, this transmigration from one body to another happens in different species of life to accommodate different types of desires for enjoyment. Everybody doesn't have the same desire to enjoy. Just like in the human body, nobody enjoys eating stool. Rubbish. But there is a particular body for enjoyment. For those who have such desires, the pig's body, the hog's body, somebody likes to enjoy eating, drinking fresh blood. Then they have to get the body of a tiger. A tiger pounces on its prey, kills it, and sucks the blood and eats the flesh. So, there is a suitable body. There is a body for that. The body of a tiger. Or the body of a lion. So, there are varieties of bodies. There are some birds which eat stone. So, somebody has a desire to eat stone. They have to get that particular type of body for which it's food and it is relishable. So, nature has actually fashioned 8,400,000 types of bodies. They are called species of life. And every person gets a suitable body according to the desires the person has to enjoy.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the whole creation and we are just one insignificant tiny atomic particle of spirit."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that every soul is a part and parcel of Krishna, inherently dependent on Him for maintenance and protection, and that the illusion of independence is a mistake.

But due to his being the part and parcel of the Lord, every soul, every living being, you, I, every living being, is actually part and parcel of God. This many times it has been mentioned in Srila Prabhupada's books and writings, but please understand part means we are a tiny part, a tiny amsa of God, of Krishna. Krishna is a complete whole, we are a tiny part and we are very, very, very, very, very small. It's just like an atom compared to an entire universe, entire universe, compared to the universe, whole universe as a whole, compared to that what is an atom in that universe, like that. So, Krishna is the whole creation and we are just one insignificant tiny atomic particle of spirit. Part and parcel. Parcel means we cannot be disconnected from Krishna. We cannot be independent of Krishna. We are always connected through the relationship of we are maintained and Krishna is the maintainer. Krishna maintains us. Krishna provides for us. we cannot independently get our necessities independent of Krishna supply we cannot get in necessities so to think that somebody other than Krishna is my maintainer or provider or my master is actually a mistake is a mistake under the illusory energy mistake under illusion Krishna only is the provider Krishna only is the maintainer of everyone there is a statement in the Kathopanishad Eko Bahunam Yo Vidhati Kama so therefore because we are part and parcel of the Lord we are maintained by the Lord with all necessities of life you are part and parcel of the Lord we are maintained by the Lord with all necessities of life and we are also protected by the Lord and his representatives the saintly kings.

**Key Quote:** "This body is actually a prison house."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that taking birth in the material world is like imprisonment, where the body imposes limitations on the spirit soul, and saintly kings provide protection to all living beings to fulfill their duties and terms of imprisonment.

So in the previous session we discussed what is the meaning of the word Praja, those who have taken birth in the material world. And Prabhupada explained why we take birth in the material world. What does it mean to take birth in the material world and how a saintly king as a representative of Krishna, who is the maintainer of everyone, a saintly king as a representative of Krishna gives protection to all those born in the land where he is ruling. So Sri Laprabha is explaining about the saintly kings, because Yudhishthira Maharaj made a reference to saintly kings of the past, and it is foretold that this Pariksit, who has just taken birth, will also be a saintly king like the forefathers of this dynasty. So Prabhupada says, these saintly kings give protection to all the Prajas, or living beings, to live and to fulfill their duties. But, in fact, they are both priests who issue their terms of imprisonment. This body is actually a prison house, because this body is imposing so many limitations on this spirit soul, which has got FREEDOM, just like every spirit soul is free to travel across hemos cre grantos, and repel spiders and dubies, at will in any part of the Lord's creation. We have to remember that we areżeniae of this body, but we should remember that moment we are inside this body, iber, My body imposes limitation on my mode of travel and where I can go and where I can survive, what atmosphere I can survive in, in this body. See the soul as far as I am concerned, as spirit soul, I have no death. But then if I go to a place which is not suited for my body, then the body will die, body will perish, body cannot survive. So therefore there is a need for giving protection to living beings, all the prajas.

**Key Quote:** "Cows also require protection."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of protecting all living beings, including cows and trees, and criticizes the modern tendency to prioritize only human beings.

To fulfill their terms of imprisonment. When I get this body, there is a certain duration I have to live in this body according to my karma of the past. Only then my desire to enjoy in a particular way, materially enjoy, will be fulfilled in this body. So the saintly king, they gave this. They gave protection to all living beings, without exception, to live. To live, not that unnecessarily somebody is killed and the king is a mute spectator. Just like nowadays, so many cows are being killed and they have a right to live. Why are they being killed? So therefore, Cows also require protection. Trees are being cut indiscriminately. So that is also against the principle of the scriptures that even the trees require protection to be given by the king or the ruler or the government. The trees also, they have to live within the tree body for whatever their duration. So this is very very important point, that the saintly kings used to give protection to all varieties of living beings in their kingdom. Not just only human beings. Today the understanding is only human beings have to be protected. For the government, concern is protect only human beings. What about animals? What about the trees? They also require protection.

**Key Quote:** "From the scriptures we understand there are different varieties of bodies."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that all living beings, including animals and trees, have a spirit soul and a right to live, and those who violate this right will be punished by the laws of nature.

That's why spiritually enlightened people understand that there is spirit soul in the cow's body. There is spirit soul in the tree body. There is also spirit soul in the human body. Some religious faiths, they say, Oh, there is no soul in animal body. There is only soul in human body. This is wrong. This understanding is completely wrong. From the scriptures we understand there are different varieties of bodies. Different varieties of species of life. This is the correct understanding. This is the scientific fact. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Pariksit was actually an ideal saintly king because while touring his kingdom, he happened to see that a poor cow was about to be killed by the person. He was about to be killed by the personified Kali whom he at once took to task as a murderer. See, Prabhupada is giving an example. This will be explained later. How Pariksit Maharaj dealt with Kali Purusha, the personification of this age, we are living in Kali Yuga. Kali Purusha, he was about to kill a cow. When Pariksit Maharaj reached that spot, immediately he took out his sword and said, How dare you harm a cow. I am going to kill you for even attempting to kill a cow. So, Srila Prabhupada says, This means that even animals were given protection by the saintly administrators, not from any sentimental point of view, but because those who have taken their birth in the material world have the right to live. You see, that way some people have sentiment, no? Oh, poor dog, poor cat, poor mouse, or poor some creature. Different people have different sentiments towards different creatures. But this is not a king who sentimentally feels for some other birds or animals, no. It is a scientific fact that every living being has a right to live. Has a right to live, having taken birth in this world by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord. They have a right to live. And if their right is violated, then those who violate that are punishable. If they are not punished by the king, then they are going to suffer punishment in the future by the laws of nature.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of Vedic literature in understanding the nature of all creatures and emphasizes that every living being has feelings that originate from the spirit soul within the body.

By the laws of nature they will be suffering. So therefore, it is said here, animals are also given protection by the saintly administrators because the animals also have a right to live. All the saintly kings, beginning from the king of the sun globe down to the king of the earth, are so inclined by the influence of Vedic literature. See, this Vedic literature is very important. It's only in the Vedic literature you find the facts explained about Who am I? What is this world? What is the nature or constitution of all the other creatures? Those who are also living. The animals, the birds, the insects, the reptiles, the plants, the trees. Who are they? They are also spirit souls. They also have a right to live. They also feel pain when they are hurt. Of course, we can hear them cry and when they are harmed, when they are injured, they also bleed. But there may be some creatures who don't show such symptoms of pain. But there have been experiments done on some trees or some plants that they also respond to different kinds of treatment and they show symptoms. They show symptoms of pain. They show symptoms of life by which they respond to different kinds of treatment. So, according to the Vedic literature, every living being has feelings that originally belongs to whom? To the spirit soul within the body.

**Key Quote:** "If I give pain to somebody else, I'll be punished by the laws of nature that I also have to suffer similar pain in future."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a child who cannot express their pain, the speaker explains that all living beings feel pain, even if they cannot express it, and inflicting pain on others will result in punishment according to the laws of nature.

The body may not be having the facility to express. Just like a child. If it is having stomach pain, it cannot exactly tell its mother, my stomach is paining. So what will the child do? Just cry. That's all. So the mother has to figure out why is the child crying. Is it crying because it's hungry? Is it crying because it has stomach pain? Is it crying because the aunt is biting its toe? The mother has to figure out. The child cannot express. So does it mean the child cannot express therefore it doesn't have any specific requirement? No, it has, but it cannot express. Similarly, the plants, they feel pain. But just because they cannot cry, so does it mean they don't feel the pain? So this is the mistake of the modern civilization, who are uneducated, who don't have proper knowledge, and who are unaware that if I give pain to somebody else, I'll be punished by the laws of nature that I also have to suffer similar pain in future. Therefore, when the king gives punishment, then the king is doing a great favor to that soul or the person who is inflicting the pain. He gets the lesson that I should not unnecessarily give pain to others because then I will be punished. Then I have to suffer pain. Atmavat sarva bhuteshu If I suffer pain and I don't want to suffer, similarly others also suffer pain, they should not be given pain. They should not inflict suffering on anyone else, any other living creature. So this is the philosophy of life.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the philosophy of 'live and let live' taught in Vedic literature and explains how knowledge is passed down through disciplic succession, using the example of Krishna teaching the Bhagavad Gita to the Sun God, who then taught it to his son Manu, and then to Ikshvaku.

This is the philosophy of life. The Vedic literatures educate us in this philosophy of life. Live and let live. The Vedic literatures have taught in higher planets also, as there is reference in the Bhagavad Gita about the teachings to Sun God Vivasvan by the Lord, Supreme Lord Krishna. And such lessons are transferred by disciplic succession as it was done by the Sun God to his son Manu. imam vivasvate yogam proktavanam abhyayam vivasvan manave praha vivasvan, the Sun God, he has a son by name Manu, vaivasvata Manu. That vaivasvata Manu is ruling in this vanvantara, the human beings. And he was taught, first of all Krishna says he taught the Bhagavad Gita to the Sun God. Sun God means the the controller of the Sun planet, the ruler of the Sun planet. And the Sun God taught it to his son Manu, vaivasvata Manu. The same lessons which Krishna taught to Vivasvan, Sun God, same lessons Vivasvan taught it to vaivasvata Manu. And from Manu to Ikshvaku, Ikshvaku, Ikshvaku is the first king in the in this earth planet, in this vanvantara, Ikshvaku. So Ikshvaku's name is mentioned here. Like Ikshvaku, this child will be maintaining everyone perfectly whoever has taken birth in the land, like Ikshvaku. Ikshvaku was famous. As a saintly king, like him, this Pariksit also will be a saintly king. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "So the teaching of Bhagavad Gita is coming down in parampara, in disciplic succession, in the parampara of Rajarshis, the saintly kings."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the role of saintly kings in protecting all living beings and discusses the parampara (disciplic succession) through which the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita was transmitted, starting from Krishna to Vivasvan, Manu, and Ikshwaku.

the son of Manu, Maharaj Dasaratha. So in the purport, we were discussing that saintly kings, they give protection to all the prajas, all the living beings who are taken birth in a particular land or the kingdom, irrespective of whether that living being is a cow, or a tree, or a human being. So they don't discriminate between giving protection for humans and non-humans. No, there is no such discrimination. Everyone has the right to live. So it was explained in the past two sessions, how the kings in the former times, they were trained up to actually represent Krishna, who is the ultimate protector and maintainer of everyone, to actually give protection to all the creatures who are all living beings. So we had discussed up to the point that Bhagavad Gita was first spoken by Krishna to Vivaswan, the sun god, millions of years back. And the sun god, he spoke that same science of yoga, the Bhagavad Gita, to Vaivasvata Manu. Vaivasvata Manu is the current Manu who is ruling the human being. And his name is Vaivasvata Manu, his name is Shraddha Deva actually. And this Vaivasvata Manu's son, Ikshwaku, Maharaj Ikshwaku, Maharaj Ikshwaku was the emperor of this earth planet at the beginning of this Manvantara. In a day of Brahma, there are 14 Manus. And the Manu referred here is the seventh Manu, the one who is the present Manu. So Shraddha Prabhupada says this Vaivasvata Manu had 10 sons. And Maharaj Ikshwaku is one of the 10 sons of Vaivasvata Manu. Maharaj Ikshwaku learned Bhakti Yoga, as taught in Bhagavad Gita from his father, Vaivasvata Manu. Now this Vaivasvata Manu learned it from his father, Vivasvan. And Vivasvan learned it directly from Krishna, when Krishna instructed Vivasvan.

**Key Quote:** "All the Vedic literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material world."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the breaking of the Rajarshi parampara, the eternal nature of Vedic literatures, and further details about Maharaj Ikshwaku, including his lineage and his prohibition of meat-eating.

So the teaching of Bhagavad Gita is coming down in parampara, in disciplic succession, in the parampara of Rajarshis, the saintly kings. In course of time, this parampara of Rajarshis, where the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita is transmitted without change from one king to the next king, that chain was broken. And therefore, again Krishna had to speak the same Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, all the Vedic literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material world. And thus the Vedic literatures are known as Apavrushaya, not made by any man, not creation of any created being of this world. No, it is coming from Krishna to Brahma down. And the Vedic knowledge... Krishna is first heard at the very beginning of creation by Brahma, the first created being within the universe, directly from Krishna. Then, about Maharaj Ikshwaku, Srila Prabhupada says, he is one of the sons of Vaivasvata Manu, as it was mentioned earlier. Vaivasvata Manu had ten sons, so one of them was Maharaj Ikshwaku. And Maharaj Ikshwaku had... He had one hundred sons. He prohibited meat-eating, and his son, Shashada, became the next king after his death.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Pariksit will be like Ikshwaku in maintaining everyone and highlights the importance of a king receiving knowledge in parampara and possessing specific qualifications to be a proper protector.

So, since the reference is made in this verse, that this child, Pariksit, shall be exactly like King Ikshwaku in maintaining all those who are born. So, maintaining those who are born, the king is able, capable, it's possible for him to maintain all those who are born in a particular land in his kingdom, if he is receiving the knowledge in the parampara, and he is a strict follower of those principles, explained in the authentic scriptures and that way the king will be a perfect representative of the Supreme Lord who is the ultimate maintainer of all living beings taking birth in this material world so for the king to be a perfect representative and therefore a proper protector of the Praja he has to be qualified he has to be trained he has to be knowledgeable he has to be having the

But in the beginning of the creation, only Brahma was there. Brahma created the Prajapatis. The Prajapatis created the first of each species. And then the species multiplied and the population increased. The whole universe was populated. All the plants were populated with different varieties of species of living beings.

#### Matsya Avatar, Vaivasvata Manu, Ikshwaku, protection

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Pariksit will be like Ikshwaku in maintaining everyone perfectly."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Matsya Avatar's appearance during Vaivasvata Manu's reign, the principles of Bhakti Yoga taught to Manu, and how Ikshwaku ruled perfectly, emphasizing that Pariksit will emulate Ikshwaku in providing perfect protection.

So it is explained here, the Lord's incarnation of Matsya Avatara, the gigantic fish, was invented during the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu's reign. Vaivasvata Manu began ruling as the Manu, the mankind, at the beginning of the creation of Brahma. At the beginning of his term, the seventh Manvantara, of which now 28 Mahayugas have already exhausted. In one Manvantara, there are 71 Mahayugas. What is the meaning of Mahayuga? You have heard of Satyavyuga, Treta Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, Kali Yuga, each of different durations. So a cycle of these four yugas on the earth together is called a Mahayuga. So one Mahayuga, like that 28 Mahayugas are already over in this Manvantara. 28 Mahayugas are already over. Totally, a Manvantara consists of 71 Mahayugas. So the beginning of this Vaivasvata Manu's reign, that is 28 Mahayugas before the present time, the Lord incarnated as the gigantic fish, Matsya Avatar. And the Lord, in the Matsya Avatar form, he instructed this Vaivasvata Manu in principles of Bhakti Yoga. And this Vaivasvata Manu also learned the principles of Bhakti Yoga from his father, Vivasvan, who was taught the principles of Bhakti Yoga by Krishna himself. And it is further said, that this Vaivasvata Manu, he instructed the same Bhagavad Gita, the science of Bhakti Yoga, to his son Ikshwaku. And Ikshwaku was perfectly ruling in maintaining all those who are born in the land. So Pariksit will be like Ikshwaku in maintaining everyone perfectly.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Rama appeared as the son of his pure devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to the comparison with Lord Rama, highlighting his adherence to Brahmanical principles and truthfulness, and describes Rama's appearance as an incarnation of the Supreme Lord with his plenary portions.

That is what is being foretold here. Now the next comparison is made to Lord Rama. How this Pariksit will be especially following the Brahmanical principles in being true to his promise, like Lord Rama, who ruled millions of years back, the son of Maharaj Dasharatha. So Srila Prabhupada in the purport describes briefly about Lord Rama. Lord Rama appeared as the son of his pure devotee. Lord Rama is the Supreme Lord himself. Sakshat Bhagavan from the spiritual world is coming and descending and incarnating as Rama, son of Maharaj Dasharatha. When the Lord comes in this world, he appears as the son of his devotee or appears in an extraordinary way. So his birth is not ordinary or his appearance is not ordinary. It is extraordinary appearance. He is not bound by any laws of material nature. He does not accept the material body. He comes in a spiritual form, and his form is completely transcendental to all material modes of nature. So Rama appeared along with his plenary portions who appeared as his younger brothers. Rama had three younger brothers: Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna. And all of them are the personality of Godhead, different plenary portions. Just like Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha appeared as Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna.

**Key Quote:** "Rama was known for giving perfect protection to all the people of Prajna."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts Lord Rama's acts of protecting sages and killing demons, emphasizing his role in providing perfect protection, and reiterates that Pariksit will also offer similar protection before concluding the session.

That's what is explained elsewhere in the Bhagavatam. When this Rama was a young boy, he helped the great sage Vishwamitra by killing one Subahu, one big demon. And these demons were disturbing the sages who were performing yajna for the welfare of the people of the world. So Rama actually killed this Subahu and also he killed 14,000 Rakshasa associates of Ravana. And he specifically also killed Ravana on the request of the devatas. So Rama was known for giving perfect protection to all the people of Prajna, all the living beings in his kingdom. Similarly Parikshit also will give protection. That's what is told. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "That is the responsibility of a ruler"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the qualities of a qualified king as mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing the king's responsibility to ensure the happiness and ultimate liberation of the people.

The two comparisons are made. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: A king becomes famous by his acts of charity, performances of yajnas, protection of the surrendered, etc. So three different aspects are specifically mentioned about Pariksit Maharaj when he grows up to be the king. Emperor, he will be famous for his acts of charity. A king, if he is qualified as mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, he should have the qualifications after having been trained and after having assimilated the knowledge, the skill, the proper understanding, and such a king is able to rule the people, the whole kingdom in such a way that people will be happy when the king is ruling, and at the end, people will be able to get liberation from material bondage.

**Key Quote:** "At the same time he has to also engage the people in acts of sacrifice so that they are ultimately liberated form material bondage"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe the duties of a king, including engaging people in spiritual activities and protecting the surrendered souls.

That is the responsibility of a ruler. Not only he should ensure that people are happy and there is peace and there are no miscreants disturbing saintly persons or weaker sections of society, at the same time he has to also engage the people in acts of sacrifice so that they are ultimately liberated form material bondage. Otherwise, if there is no such endeavor for engaging in spiritual activities, then people simply continue the cycle of birth and death and continue to suffer life after life after life. So it is a king's responsibility as the representative of the Supreme Lord. So here it is said that Srila Prabhupada [mentions] three specific qualifications of an ideal king. He should be well trained to perform acts of charity, dana. He should perform yajna. He should himself perform yajna for the welfare of the whole kingdom and he should engage others in performing yajna according to their position, according to their duty as enjoined in the scriptures and as taught by the scriptures. The Supreme Lord and his representatives, the bona fide spiritual masters, and the king should also give protection to the surrendered souls.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord is all-powerful and true to his word and therefore he never fails to give protection to his different devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept of 'Ishwara Bhava' (attitude of the Lord) in a king, emphasizing the importance of protecting surrendered souls and relating it to the Lord's promise of protection to his devotees.

This is also a king's duty, responsibility, it's one of his qualifications. Now Srila Prabhupada particularly says here, a Kshatriya king is proud to give protection to the surrendered souls. And this is specifically mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. This attitude of a king is called Ishwara Bhava. Ishwara Bhava is mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita in the 18th chapter. So Ishwara Bhava means factual power to give protection in a righteous cause when the citizens are upright in their behavior, in their conduct. Then there should be protection by the king to such righteous people for a righteous cause. They should not be overpowered by miscreants, by demons, by materialists, by all kinds of ruffians. No. Then the king is not a capable person, neither he is doing his duty, nor he is going to help the people in ultimately attaining liberation. So in the Bhagavad Gita, Lord instructs living beings to surrender unto him, and the Lord promises all protection. The Lord is all-powerful and true to his word and therefore he never fails to give protection to his different devotees.

**Key Quote:** "And this was very nicely demonstrated by one former king, Maharaj Shibi, he is famous for giving protection to the surrendered."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the example of Maharaj Shibi as a king famous for giving protection to the surrendered, setting the stage for narrating a story about him.

The Lord never fails to give protection to his different devotees. He says Kaunteya Pratijaanihi Name Bhakta Pranasyati. My devotee is never going to be vanquished because I will always protect my devotee in all circumstances. So Srila Prabhupada particularly points out here, the king being the representative of the Lord, he must possess this attitude of giving protection to the surrendered souls at all risk. The king must give protection to the surrendered souls at all risk. And this was very nicely demonstrated by one former king, Maharaj Shibi, he is famous for giving protection to the surrendered. So that particular instance from the scriptures is narrated by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Maharaj Shibi was the king of Ushinara, a particular province. And Maharaj Jayati was the intimate friend of Maharaj Shibi. Jayati was a famous king in the former times, same time.

**Key Quote:** "The pigeon while being chased by the eagle took the shelter of the lap of Maharaj Shibi."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to narrate the story of Maharaj Shibi, Indra (as an eagle), and Agni (as a pigeon), focusing on the pigeon seeking shelter with Shibi.

And Maharaj Jayati was able to reach the heavenly planets along with Maharaj Shibi. So the scriptures describe how. Well, in the Mahabharata it is mentioned that Maharaj Shibi was aware of the heavenly planet where he was to be transferred after his death. And, the description of this heavenly planet where Maharaj Shibi transferred himself is described in the Mahabarata, Adiparva, 96th chapter verses six to nine. It is particularly mentioned in the Mahabharata that Maharaj Shibi was so charitably disposed because the scriptures say king should be charitable. He would be famous for acts of charity, dana. So Maharaj Shibi was very famous for giving charity that he wanted to give over his acquired position in heavenly kingdom to Yayaati. He was so charitably disposed. But Yayaati did not accept this charity by Shibi. So this Shibi he became a very famous king as a protector of surrendered souls and as a donor of charities. So it is said here that the king of heaven Indra once took the shape of the whole and the form of this kalkin social was the character of Ragamkar as well. So Maharaj Shibi once accepted him as aителя as the arch zoys to make матери sense this family. of a pigeon hunter bird, an eagle. Indra took the form of an eagle. And Agni, the fire god, took the shape of a pigeon. So, eagle and pigeon, actually they are disguised. Indra is disguised as eagle and Agni is disguised as pigeon. The pigeon while being chased by the eagle took the shelter of the lap of Maharaj Shibi. The pigeon came and landed on Shibi's lap. And the hunter eagle wanted the pigeon back from the king. So, King Shibi, since this pigeon had taken shelter of King Shibi, the king did not want that eagle to take away this pigeon.

**Key Quote:** "so when he put himself in the balance i will offer my entire body because any amount of self on the balance to equate with the pigeon the devatas were pleased with him so charitable sacrificed his own life even for the sake of saving the pigeon which has surrendered to him"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Maharaj Shibi, highlighting his willingness to sacrifice his own flesh and eventually his entire body to protect the pigeon, leading to the revelation of Indra and Agni and their blessings.

Kill it and eat the flesh. So, the king wanted to give some other meat to eat for the eagle. And he requested that eagle, please do not kill this pigeon because it has taken shelter of me. I should be giving it protection. So, do not kill this pigeon. You want some flesh, I will give you some other flesh. Now, this hunter bird, the eagle refused to accept the king's offer. The eagle refused to accept this offer by King Shibi. And later on it was settled that the eagle would accept flesh from the body of the king, and it would accept flesh from the body of the king equivalent to the weight of the pigeon. So the king agreed for that, okay, you want my flesh, I'll give you, but don't kill this pigeon. So he was so generous in giving charity. But now listen what happened. The king began to cut flesh from his body to give a weight of his own flesh equivalent to the pigeon's weight. So there was a balance and one side the pigeon was kept in the balance, other side Shibi's flesh was being put in the balance to match the weight of the flesh that was to be given to this eagle, the hunter bird. But what happened when this weighing was going on, the mystic pigeon always remained heavier. How much ever Shibi was cutting his flesh and putting in the balance in the pan of the balance. So then what did Shibi do? How much will I cut? I myself will sit on the pan. I'll offer my entire body because any amount of flesh I am cutting off and putting it doesn't seem to be balancing the weight of the pigeon. So when he put himself in the balance, I will offer my entire body because any amount of self on the balance to equate with the pigeon, the devatas were pleased with him. So charitable, [he] sacrificed his own life even for the sake of saving the pigeon which has surrendered to him, so protector of the surrendered. So then Indra and Agni disclosed their identity and the king was, Shibi was blessed by them. Devarshi Narada also

glorified Maharaj Shibi for his great achievements in specifically giving charity and protection to the surrendered. It is also said this Maharaj Shibi sacrificed his own son for the satisfaction of human beings in his kingdom. So that's another story in the scriptures. So in this way, Shibi was very famous for giving charity and sacrificing his personal interest for the sake of giving protection to somebody else who is a surrendered soul. So therefore, it is said here, this child Pariksit would be as generous in giving charity and as perfect in giving protection to surrendered souls like Shibi. So he was to become a second Shibi in charity and protection. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Now we will discuss about Bharata, the son of Maharaj Dushyanta. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada briefly mentions the history of this Bharata, the son of Maharaj Dushyanta. First of all, Srila Prabhupada says, "There are many Bharatas in history, of which three are very famous." Three Bharatas are famous. Who are the three Bharatas who are very famous? The first one is the Bharata who is the brother of the king, the brother of Lord Ramachandra, who is actually the son of Dasharatha Maharaj, that Bharata. You can say Dasharathi Bharata. The second Bharata who is famous in history, Vedic history, is Bharata, the son of king Rishabha. The Lord appeared as Rishabhadeva, king Rishabhadeva, emperor of the world, and he had one hundred sons. Of these one hundred sons, the eldest one was Bharata Maharaj. That Bharata Maharaj, he renounced his kingdom at a very young age, practiced very nice austerities, and became advanced spiritually. But towards the end of his life, when he was performing tapasya, after retiring from his kingdom, he got attached to a deer, and he had to take a deer's body in his next life, even though he was spiritually very advanced, and he was given remembrance of his spiritual activities by Krishna within his heart, even in the body of a deer. And he was very, very cautious not to get misled by any material, even in the body of a deer. And then he was again given a chance to take birth in a brahmana family, and in that life, third life, he perfected himself and went back to God. So that Bharata is also famous, the second Bharata. And the third Bharata who is famous is mentioned in this verse: Bharata, the son of Maharaj Dushyanta. He is also very famous.

**Key Quote:** "The Vedic scriptures give us knowledge which is comprehensive and vast as compared to the body of knowledge that we have in our modern day."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the comprehensive knowledge of Vedic scriptures with the limited scope of modern-day knowledge, emphasizing the vastness of universal history described in the Vedas.

So, all these Bharatas are historically known to the universe. See, the scriptures describe universal history. And nowadays, the discussion about history is only about some incidents that happened on this planet in the past. But various literature are describing to us the history of the universe. There are millions of planets in one universe. There are millions of universes in this material creation. And apart from this material creation, there is spiritual world which is not created, which is eternal. So all these are described in the Vedic literature, the Vedic scriptures. So the Vedic scriptures give us knowledge which is comprehensive and vast as compared to the body of knowledge that we have in our modern day. The Vedic scriptures give us knowledge which is very, very limited and tiny and incomplete, imperfect knowledge.

**Summary:** The lecture explains how the earth planet came to be known as Bharata Varsha due to King Bharata, the son of Rishabhadeva, while also highlighting the importance of Bharata, the son of Maharaj Dushyanta.

So, the three Bharatas are historically known to the universe. This earth planet is known as Bharata, Bharata Varsha. Bharata Varsha is known as Bharata Varsha due to King Bharata, the son of Rishabhadeva, the second Bharata I mentioned. After Rishabhadeva's son Bharata was ruling, this earth planet became famous Bharata Varsha. Before the reign of this Bharata, king of this earth planet, and all the various planets created, Bharata became the son of King Rishabha. This land was known as Ilaavrita Varsha, and just after the coronation of the King Bharata, who was the son of Rishabha, this land became famous as Bharata Varsha. Now Srila Prabhupada says, even though the second Bharata is very famous because the land itself, the planet earth itself, is famous as Bharata Varsha, nonetheless Bharata, the son of Maharaj Dushyanta, was no less important. He was also a very great personality, and his history is also recorded in our scriptures. Now this Bharata, the son of Maharaj Dushyanta, who is described as Doshan Tyr Eva Yajvanam Doshanti Bharata, son of Dushyanta.

**Key Quote:** "This child Bharata even in his childhood he was so powerful that he challenged the lions and elephants in the forest and would fight with them as little children play with cats and dogs."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Bharata's birth to Shakuntala and Maharaj Dushyanta, and his extraordinary strength as a child growing up in the forest, even comparing him to Tarzan.

He is the son of the famous beauty Shakuntala. So it is described elsewhere, Marnellos themselves fell in love with Shakuntala in the forest, and Bharata was conceived as the son of Maharaj Dushyanta and Shakuntala. Now this Maharaj, he forgot his wife Shakuntala by the curse of one Kanvamuni. The details are given elsewhere. Here Prabhupada mentions briefly the history, and therefore this child Bharata was brought up in the forest by his mother, son of a Kshatriya king, and this child was raised by the mother in the forest itself. Now this child Bharata, even in his childhood, he was so powerful that he challenged the lions and elephants in the forest and would fight with them as little children play with cats and dogs. This much powerful this Bharata, the son of Maharaja Dushyanta, was even when he was a young boy raised in the forest by his mother Shakuntala. Now it is said because of the boys becoming so strong, single-handedly he could combat elephants and lions in the forest, so he became so strong, more than the so-called Tarzan. There are fictitious characters created nowadays who are actually not real people who have got any strength.

**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the reality of Bharata's character and his strength, explaining why he was called Sarva Dhaman and how the Pandavas are addressed as Bharata due to their lineage.

They are characters created for the sake of some entertainment for children. So one such character Prabhupada mentions, Tarzan. This boy Bharata is not a fictitious character created by some imaginative story writer. No, he is a real person, and as a boy he was even more powerful than the so-called Tarzan. Therefore the rishis in the forest, they called him Sarva Dhaman. This means one who is able to control everyone else is so powerful, Sarva Dhaman, they called him like that. And Srila Prabhupada says this Maharaja Bharata, son of Dushyanta, is fully described in the Mahabharata Aadi Parva. Now the Pandavas or the Kurus are saying that his son was a boy, are sometimes addressed as Bharata. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna addresses Arjuna as Bharata.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of performing sacrifices (yajña) for the welfare of the kingdom, highlighting the natural cycle of food production, rainfall, and the role of yajña in maintaining this balance.

So that is because the Pandavas are born in the dynasty of the famous Maharaj Bharata, who was the son of King Dushyanta. That's why the Pandavas are called Bharata or the members of the Kuru dynasty also. Even Dhritarashtra is addressed as Bharata by Sanjaya in the Bhagavad Gita. So that name Bharata for the descendant of Bharata, the son of King Dushyanta. So this Bharata was famous for performing many many sacrifices. A king should perform sacrifices for the sake of the welfare of the whole kingdom, because in the Bhagavad Gita it is explained that annad bhavanti bhutani parjanyad anna sambhavah yajnyad bhavati parjanyo yajna karma samutbhavah.

#### Food Production, Rainfall, Yajna, Prescribed Duties

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, General public
**Key Quote:** "So production of grains, sufficient quantity of grains for all creatures, humans and the animals and the other birds etc. depends on proper rainfall."
**Summary:** The lecture elaborates on the dependence of food production on rainfall, which in turn is dependent on the performance of yajña, emphasizing the importance of prescribed duties for the welfare of all beings.

There is a cycle that is operating in this earth planet. What is that? That all living beings subsist on food grains directly or indirectly. The vegetarians directly subsist on food grains, but the non-vegetarians they subsist on animals who subsist on food grains. So therefore directly or indirectly all living beings are dependent on food grains. And the food grains are due to rains, proper rainfall. We know that when there is excessive rain or there is scarcity of rain then there is no proper production of grains. So production of grains, sufficient quantity of grains for all creatures, humans and the animals and the other birds etc. depends on proper rainfall, because we cannot manufacture food grains in factories and industries and all kinds of scientific research. We cannot manufacture food grains. It has to be grown on the land, fertile land. And even if the land is fertile, unless there is proper rainfall, you cannot get sufficient grains production. So now the rains are dependent on yajñād bhavati parjanyo. Parjanyo means rainfall. Rainfall is dependent on proper performance of yajña. So yajña performance by the human beings ensures adequate rainfall, not too much, not too little. And if there is proper rainfall, there is plenty of grain production, and that grain production will nourish all creatures on this earth planet, human beings and the lower creatures also, everyone. And this is the arrangement of the Supreme Lord. Yajña karma samudbhavaha. Yajña means to perform prescribed duties, not self-assumed duties.

**Key Quote:** "Duty is something that is prescribed in this jastra for the overall welfare of the entire population of this world."
**Summary:** The speaker stresses that duties are prescribed for the welfare of all, and the king's role in performing yajña leads to prosperity for the entire country, foretelling Pariksit's future role.

Nowadays people think, oh my duty is something, according to what I think is my duty. No. Duty is something that is prescribed in this shastra for the overall welfare of the entire population of this world. Otherwise, by artificial means, we cannot get our necessities. Not possible. There will only be a failure of the administrators to provide for the necessities of the people of the country by artificial methods is not going to work. So Bhagavad Gita says the natural method is they should perform yajña. And the foremost person to perform yajña is the king, the ruler, the leader of all the people in the world. He should perform yajña. And when he performs yajña, there is prosperity for all the people of the country. And this Dushyanta was famous for having performed many sacrifices. Similarly, Pariksit also will perform sacrifices for the welfare of the entire kingdom, and there will be prosperity because of this child growing up to rule the whole world. That is what is being foretold by the brahmanas to King Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "Amongst great bowmen this child will be as good as Arjuna."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse to be discussed, focusing on the prophecy that Pariksit will be a great bowman like Arjuna, and the qualities of a powerful king.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 21st verse of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This will be part 1 of this verse which will be discussed. Dhanvinam Agraneer Esha Tulyas Charjunayor Dwayoho Hutasha Iva Durdharsaha Samudra Iva Dustaraha. The meaning of this verse is: amongst great bowmen, this child will be as good as Arjuna. He will be as irresistible as fire. Unsurpassable as the ocean. So, three comparisons are made in this verse. He will be a great bowman like Arjuna. And specifically, there is mention of two Arjunas here. Arjunayor Dwayoho, two Arjunas. Prabhupada mentions in the purport, in history there are two famous Arjunas. One is Kartyavirya Arjuna, who was the king of Haihaya. And the other Arjuna is the famous grandfather of King Pariksit, who is Arjuna the Pandava. Both the Arjunas are famous for their bowmanship. And the child Pariksit is foretold to be equal to both of them, particularly in fighting. King should be a powerful fighter, yes, to subdue the miscreants, to protect the innocent, to give protection to the brahmanas, the women, the children, the saintly persons. Otherwise, if the king is not powerful enough, then these miscreants and rogues and ruffians and thieves will plunder and loot from the innocent people. There will be chaos. So, Pariksit is foretold to be equal to both these Arjunas who are very, very, very powerful in fighting.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna is not an ordinary person."
**Summary:** The lecture details the lineage of Arjuna, his divine birth through Kunti and Indra, and the auspicious circumstances surrounding his birth.

Now, Srila Prabhupada gives a description of Pandava Arjuna, the Arjuna who is the grandfather of this Pariksit. Arjuna's son was Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu's son was Pariksit. In this way, Pandava Arjuna is the grandfather of Pariksit. So, Prabhupada mentions Pandava Arjuna is the great hero of the Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita was spoken by Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. And that's how we know Bhagavad Gita as the most famous scripture. It gives us the essence of the Vedic wisdom. Arjuna is the kshatriya son of Maharaj. Arjuna is the son of Pandu. Queen Kunti Devi could call for any one of the demigods. And thus she called Indra, because Kunti could not beget children through Pandu. So, it is allowed in the former ages that a lady, chaste woman, chaste wife, can beget children through the husband's brother, if the husband is unable to conceive children in his own wife. So, this is called Devarayana Sutodhpakti, and this is prohibited in Kali Yuga. But they were, Kunti and Pandu were living in Dwapar Yuga. So, in Dwapar Yuga, Kunti Devi, she had one mantra given by Durvasamuni, and thus she could call any one of the devatas to conceive a child for Pandu. So, Kunti called on Indra, and Arjuna was born. So, Arjuna is therefore a plenary part of the heavenly king Indra. Arjuna is not an ordinary person. He was. Arjuna has many names. He was born in the month of Phalguna. Therefore, he is also called Phalguni. When he appeared as the son of Kunti, his future greatness is proclaimed by air messages. This is the fame of Arjuna. Even at the time of his birth, it is declared through air messages that he is a great personality who has taken birth. And all the important personalities from different parts of the universe, such as the devatas, the demigods, the Gandharvas, the Adityas from the sun globe, the Rudras, the Vasus, the Nagas, the different Rishis of importance, the Apsaras, all attended the ceremony of the birth of Arjuna.

So, very important personality in the whole universe, Arjuna. The Apsaras pleased everyone by their heavenly dances and songs. Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krishna, and the maternal uncle of Arjuna. Arjuna's mother is Kunti. Kunti's brother is Vasudeva. Therefore, Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krishna, is actually the maternal uncle of Arjuna. Vasudeva sent his priest, representative Kashyapa, to purify Arjuna by all the prescribed samskaras, or reformatory processes. So, Arjuna's samskaras were done by Kashyapa Muni, or Kashyapa Rishi, sent by Vasudeva. His name giving samskara, it's called Namakarna samskara, was performed in the presence of the Rishis, residents of Shatashunga. The famous Rishis. Arjuna married four wives: Draupadi, Subhadra, Chitrangada, and Ulupi, from whom he got four sons, one each from each of the wives, of the names Shrutakirti, Abhimanyu, Babruvahana, and Iravaan respectively. Means Draupadi, through Draupadi, Arjuna had a son by name Shrutakirti. Through Subhadra, Subhadra is Krishna's sister. Arjuna married Subhadra, and through Subhadra, he had a son Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu died in the battle of Kurukshetra. And Abhimanyu's son is, Abhimanyu and Subhadra's son is Parikshit. Sorry. Abhimanyu's son is Subhadra. Abhimanyu and Uttara's son is Parikshit. And Arjuna's wife Chitrangada, their son was Babruvahana. And Arjuna's wife Ulupi, their son was Iravaan. So, he had four sons through four wives.

Now, how studious was Arjuna, that's described here.

At night he would practice the lessons taught by the teacher Dronacharya in the daytime. So, he was very, very studious, very sincere in his Gurukul days. He passed very brilliantly the examination in piercing the target and Dronacharya was very pleased. So, this was the expertise of Arjuna in bowmanship. He learnt from Dronacharya very nicely. Then regarding Arjuna's son Babruvahana, Srila Prabhupada says, royal families at Manipur and Tripura are descendants of Arjuna's son Babruvahana. So, present day the royal families at Manipur and Tripura are descendants of Arjuna's son Babruvahana.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Arjuna saving Dronacharya from a crocodile and being rewarded with the Brahma Shira weapon, emphasizing the importance of a proper guru for learning how to use such weapons.

Arjuna saved the Acharya, that is Dronacharya, from the attack of a crocodile and Dronacharya being pleased with him, rewarded him with a weapon of the name Brahma Shira. Many of these weapons are very, very powerful weapons. And unless one learns them from a proper guru, one will be unable to use those weapons. And many of them are mantra weapons. They are mantra weapons. So, the perfect chanting of the mantra as heard from the expert spiritual master only will enable a student to learn that in such a way that he can use that weapon when required. Now Maharaja Drupada, Draupadi's father, was inimical toward Dronacharya. Now Maharaja Drupada, Draupadi's father, was inimical toward Dronacharya.

The confidential treatment of the weapon Brahma Shira was explained to Arjuna and Dronacharya was promised by Arjuna that he would use the weapon if necessary when Dronacharya personally became an enemy of Arjuna. In this way, Dronacharya forecasted the future battle of Kurukshetra in which Dronacharya was going to fight. Dronacharya was on the opposite side of Arjuna. See, the Acharya is teaching a student and he is able to foresee the future and for the sake of Arjuna to become victorious in the battle of Kurukshetra against the Kauravas, Dronacharya is teaching him in the student days, this particular Brahma Shira.

**Summary:** The speaker explores the philosophical reasons behind Dronacharya's willingness to be killed by his disciple, emphasizing detachment from the body and the glory of sacrificing for the right cause, ending the session with a promise to continue the discussion.

So, Arjuna can use this weapon to win against the Kauravas and he can even use that to kill Dronacharya himself. So, what is the secret understanding? Why Dronacharya would teach his student a particular astra, how to use which the student will use against the teacher himself? So these are all extraordinary incidents described in the scriptures as to how a learned person knows I am NOT the body, death doesn't belong to the soul, death is only for the body and the body is going to die regardless of what happens in course of one's duration of living in this material body. If I don't die by some astra, I may die by some other method or means. So death I cannot escape, but dying for the right cause, sacrificing life for the right cause makes one glorious, makes one advanced spiritually. So that is the principle we have to understand why Dronacharya was willing to be even killed by his own disciple by teaching the disciple the secret Brahma Shira astra mantra. We will continue discussing this in the next.

**Key Quote:** "When you grow up, don't worry. I will give you half of my kingdom because I am the only son of my father. So I will give you half of my kingdom. Don't worry. You don't have to suffer in poverty like your father."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Drupada and Dronacharya, focusing on their friendship in Gurukul and Drupada's promise to share his kingdom.

The history is that Drupada and Dronacharya, when they were young students, they studied in the same Guruko, and they were good friends in the Guruko. But this friendship was between the rich son of the rich Kshatriya. Drupada was the son of a very powerful and rich Kshatriya, and Dronacharya was the son of a poor Brahmana. So when Drupada grew up, he became the king of the province called Panchaladesha, very rich. And Dronacharya grew up, but he was just a poor Brahmana's son. So he was another poor Brahmana. Now during the Gurukul days, because they were very good friends, once Drupada, in a, on a certain occasion, he promised to Dronacharya, "When you grow up, don't worry. I will give you half of my kingdom because I am the only son of my father. So I will give you half of my kingdom. Don't worry. You don't have to suffer in poverty like your father." So Dronacharya took these words of Drupada to heart, and he always remembered, even when they went back to their own country, when they went back to their own home after completing the Gurukul education. And Dronacharya was living in utter poverty. So after he got married and he had a son, Ashwatthama, small boy, the boy one day began to cry to his mother that "I have not tasted what is real milk. All my friends say milk is very, very nourishing and very, very tasty and very nice to drink, but I don't know what is milk." So Dronacharya's wife, Ashwatthama's mother, she felt very bad that they were in such poverty stricken condition, that they could not feed their child cow's milk. So she told her husband Dronacharya that "We are so poor. We cannot even feed our child some cow's milk." So Dronacharya said, "Don't worry. I will go to my friend, my friend from Gurukul days, Maharaj Drupada, and I will beg from him in charity a cow. He has promised to give me half his kingdom, but I don't want his wealth in that way, but I will just ask for a cow donation."

**Summary:** The speaker describes Dronacharya's visit to Drupada and the insult he receives due to his poverty.

So he set out from his place to visit Maharaj Drupada in Panchala Desha. And because he was a brahmana, there was no restriction for brahmanas going and meeting kings. So he was let in. And when he came in presence of Drupada, Drupada looked at him. "Who are you?" So then he said, "You don't remember me? I am your friend from Gurukul days." Then Drupada somehow, he thought it is an insult that a wretched, poor person is claiming friendship with a rich and powerful king. So then Drupada, he told Drona that "Friendship is always between equals. So you are a poor and wretched, poverty stricken person. How can you be my friend? What is my status and what is your status?" So Dronacharya was feeling very, very insulted that this Drupada has become very proud of his power and his position and his wealth. "I am going to teach him a lesson." So thinking, he did not utter a single word. He just walked back to his own place.

Dronacharya was powerful enough to kill Drona himself. Dronacharya never hesitated to impart all the military secrets to this boy because he was a Kshatriya and he had come seeking training in the military arts. So Dronacharya as a liberal Brahmana he taught everything, all the military science to this Drupada's son and that Drupada's son was ready to fight against the Kauravas when he was fighting on the side of the Pandavas and Dronacharya was on the side of the Kauravas.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the story by describing the Swayamvara ceremony where Arjuna, disguised as a brahmana, wins Draupadi's hand in marriage.

house shellac house into which the Pandavas were sent and before Duryodhana could set fire the Pandavas escaped through a secret tunnel they dug in the earth and when they were living incognito after escaping that is when Drupada decided to hold a Swayamvara ceremony for marrying Draupadi and he arranged Draupadi's personal selection of a groom who could pierce the eye of a fish hanging on the ceiling. This trick was made especially because only Arjuna could do it and he somehow thought that Arjuna was killed in that fire of the shellac house but actually the Pandavas had escaped. When the Pandavas heard about Drupada's deciding to hold a Swayamvara ceremony for marrying his daughter the Pandavas went there for that ceremony. Of course they were living incognito as brahmanas. They were dressed as some poor brahmanas. So they went there and when all the other Kshatriya kings were there they were dressed as some poor brahmanas. When the Pandavas heard that the Kshatriya kings failed to pass the test set by Drupada then Arjuna in the guise of a poor brahmana he passed the test and Draupadi was garlanded sorry Draupadi garlanded Arjuna though she did not know he was Arjuna. And later on Lord Krishna disclosed Arjuna's identity to Balaram and when Drupada came to know that this poor brahmana is Arjuna he was very very very happy to marry his daughter to Arjuna.

Will he be as worthy as his forefathers? That was his anxiety. So the brahmanas assured him this child is a highly qualified child.

**Key Quote:** "But we have to purify our consciousness and become free from all the contaminating bad qualities, which are a result of the material contamination in contact with material nature."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the purification of consciousness through yoga, emphasizing the removal of material contamination to reveal inherent good qualities.

This statement is in the Bhagavatam that a pure devotee has all good qualities. Actually, every living being, a spirit soul, has all good qualities, but it's only because we are covered by the material contamination that our good qualities get covered and the contamination which brings forth all kinds of bad qualities. So as spirit soul, nobody is a bad person. No living being is a bad person, a spirit soul. But we have to purify our consciousness and become free from all the contaminating bad qualities, which are a result of the material contamination in contact with material nature. So therefore the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says that by practicing yoga, Yogam Atma Vishuddhi, you purify your heart of all the dirty things, then the good qualities will shine forth from a purified heart. And the process of purification is the process of yoga. But among the yoga processes, the best process is the process of Bhakti Yoga.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna satisfied the fire god, Agnideva, by setting fire to the Khandava forest. And thus the fire god gave him one weapon."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts Arjuna's various achievements, including obtaining weapons from the fire god and other demigods, defeating Indra, and assisting Yudhishthira.

Further it is described, Arjuna satisfied the fire god, Agnideva, by setting fire to the Khandava forest. And thus the fire god gave him one weapon. Arjuna actually was preparing for the big battle of Kurukshetra because the Pandavas were excited. They were exiled by Duryodhana when they were cheated in a gambling match. They were cheated by Duryodhana and they were exiled. So after that exile period was over, Duryodhana refused to give back their kingdom to the Pandavas. So then war was inevitable. But in the meantime, during exile, Arjuna actually was preparing. So he got one weapon from the fire god. And when the Khandava forest was set on fire, Indra became angry. And Indra, assisted by all other demigods, began fighting with Arjuna because Arjuna set fire to the forest. So all the devatas headed by Indra, they were defeated by Arjuna. And Indra returned to his heavenly kingdom after suffering defeat at the hands of Arjuna. Then Arjuna also promised protection to one Mayadanava or Mayasura. And Mayasura, being protected by Arjuna actually, he presented one valuable conch shell celebrated as the devadatta. Similarly, Arjuna received many other valuable weapons from Indradeva when Indradeva was satisfied to see the chivalry of Arjuna. When Yudhishthira was disappointed in defeating Jarasandha, then Arjuna gave assurance to Yudhishthira that Arjuna, Bhima and Krishna will go to Magadha to challenge Jarasandha. And when they went, Bhima was able to kill Jarasandha. And in that way, Yudhishthira was able to hold the Rajasuya sacrifice. Then Arjuna also underwent severe types of penances when he was rewarded by Indradeva. Shiva also once wanted to try the strength of Arjuna, and Shiva disguised as an aborigin, he met Arjuna. There is a fight between Shiva disguised as the aborigin and Arjuna, and Shiva was satisfied with Arjuna's chivalrous nature, his bravery and his skill in fighting, and Shiva disclosed his identity. So, Arjuna prayed to Lord Shiva in all humbleness, and when Shiva was satisfied with Arjuna's behavior, Shiva presented his Pashupatastra to Arjuna. In this way, Arjuna acquired many other important weapons from different devatas. He got Dandastra from Yamaraj. He got Pashastra from Varuna. He got Antaradhanaastra from Kuvera. And actually, Arjuna was fully equipped to fight that battle of Kurukshetra in order to win back Kurukshetra, win back the kingdom from Duryodhana. Even when Duryodhana was under the clutches of some Gandharvas, that time, Arjuna actually fought against the Gandharvas and released Duryodhana. And it is also described that

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the description of Arjuna's life, mentioning his role in the Bhagavad Gita, his actions after Krishna's disappearance, and his journey to Mahaprasthana, before ending the session with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

Arjuna was the one to whom the philosophical discourses on the Bhagavad Gita were spoken by Lord Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. And even on the battlefield, Arjuna fought very very wonderfully against the Kauravas. And after the disappearance of Lord Krishna, the message was brought by Arjuna to Maharaja Yudhishtira. And Arjuna actually, when Vasudeva passed away after the disappearance of Krishna, then Arjuna performed the funeral ceremony of Vasudeva in the absence of Krishna. So at last, when advised by Vasudeva, all the Pandava brothers headed for Mahaprasthana. On the way, at the request of his brother, Arjuna gave up all important weapons as useless, and he proceeded on Mahaprasthana. So this is the description of the history of the Pandava Arjuna as given by Srila Prabhupada in this purport. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "One should be a lamb at home and a lion in the chase."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the comparison of Parikshit to a lion, explaining the qualities of a Kshatriya, emphasizing strength in protecting citizens and chasing enemies, but humility at home.

Wonderful qualities of the child Parikshit are being described by the Brahmanas who are performing the Jatakarma samskara for the child. Yudhishthira is hearing all this and he is very satisfied that such a qualified child has actually taken birth in his family. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, "One is compared to the lion when one is very strong in chasing an enemy among the animals in the jungle. The king of the jungle or the forest is the lion because the lion is very strong in chasing an enemy. One should be a lamb at home and a lion in the chase." So this is the moral instruction that however strong one is or powerful one is, that strength or power is not shown at home. At home in front of elders, family members and other well-wishers one should be very mild and humble. But somebody... Who is a Kshatriya he should be like a lion in the chase, means he should be very strong in chasing the enemy. And Srila Prabhupada says the lion is never a failure when it comes to chasing an animal.

Like even though people are doing so many destructive activities. But earth never fails to provide for the inhabitants of this planet. Whatever their basic needs are. So this child will be forbearing like the earth. That is the prediction being made by the brahmanas. And finally one more characteristic of the child is. The child will be as tolerant as his parents. So Srila Prabhupada says, "Parents are always tolerant to children for all sorts of mischievous activities the child may perform." An ideal king may be possessed of all these blessings. All these good qualities. So this child Pariksit will grow up to be a very good king. Ideal king. Who will be very tolerant towards the citizens. In order to protect them. And give them good shelter. Good protection. So like parents are tolerant. Pariksit also as the emperor. As the king. Will be tolerant of the citizens' different activities. So in this way. They are foretelling Pariksit's good qualities when he grows up. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

#### qualities of Pariksit, comparison to Yudhishthira, Shiva, Narayana

**Key Quote:** "So here three comparisons are made."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 23 of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam and explains the three comparisons made in the verse regarding the qualities of child Pariksit to Yudhishthira/Brahma, Shiva, and Narayana.

In this session we will be discussing from the 23rd verse of the 12th chapter, the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Pita Maha Samas Samye Prasade Girishopamaha Ashraya Sarvabhutaanam Yatha Devo Ramashrayaha. The meaning of this verse is this child will be like his grandfather Yudhishthira or Brahma in equanimity of mind. He will be munificent like the lord of the Kailasha hill, Shiva. He will be the resort of everyone like the supreme personality of God at Narayana who is even the shelter of the goddess of fortune. So further description of the wonderful qualities of child Pariksit are being given by the Brahmanas to King Yudhishthira. So here three comparisons are made. In mental equanimity, he will be like his grandfather Yudhishthira or grandfather Brahma. And in being munificent, very generous, he will be like lord Shiva. And he will be the ultimate resort of everyone like lord Narayana is the resort of everyone including goddess of fortune.

#### mental equanimity, welfare work, Brahma, Yudhishthira

**Key Quote:** "In both cases, the comparison is equally good because both of them are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the comparison of Pariksit to Yudhishthira and Brahma in terms of mental equanimity, explaining their roles in welfare work and how they represent the Supreme Lord.

So Srila Prabhupada has explained little elaborately in the purport how these personalities who are referred to are well known for their specific extraordinary qualities. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, mental equanimity refers both to Maharaj Yudhishthira and to Brahma, the grandfather of all living beings. According to Sridhar Swami, one of the commentators on the Bhagavatam, one of the previous Acharyas, the grandfather referred to is Brahma. How is Brahma the grandfather of all of us? Brahma's son, Swayambhuva Manu, that Swayambhuva Manu is the father of mankind. So all human beings have Swayambhuva Manu as their father and Swayambhuva Manu's father is Brahma. Therefore Brahma is the grandfather of all human beings. In that way, Brahma is referred to as the grandfather in this particular comparison, Pitamaha Samaha Samye. And then according to Srila Vishwanachakruti Thakur, another great Acharya, previous Acharya in our Sampradaya, he has written a commentary on the Bhagavatam. Srila Vishwanachakruti Thakur says, the grandfather referred to here is Maharaj Yudhishthira himself. Now Srila Prabhupada says, of course Yudhishthira is the grandfather of Pariksit. Pariksit's father is Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu is the son of Arjuna and Arjuna's brother, Yudhishthira. So therefore Yudhishthira is in the position of the grandfather of child Pariksit. Now Srila Prabhupada says something very interesting. In both cases, the comparison is equally good because both of them are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord. Both Brahma and Yudhishthira are recognized representatives of the Supreme Lord. Thus both of them have to maintain mental equanimity being engaged in welfare work for the living being.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Anyone in a position of responsibility has to have that equanimity of mind to do the welfare work in spite of criticism from the very people whom they are trying to do welfare activity."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the challenges of welfare work, using the example of Brahma being criticized by the gopis for creating eyelids, and emphasizes the importance of mental equanimity in the face of criticism.

Brahma is engaged in the welfare of all the living beings in the whole universe. That is Brahma's position. And Yudhishthira, as the emperor of the world, he was always engaged in welfare work of the citizens of the whole world. So Srila Prabhupada says, to be able to do welfare work, any responsible executive agent at the top of administration has to tolerate different types of onslaughts from the very persons for whom he works. Example is given by Srila Prabhupada. Brahma was criticized even by the gopis, the highest perfectional devotees of the Supreme Lord Krishna. The gopis were divided. The gopis were dissatisfied with the work of Brahma because Brahma as creator of this particular universe created eyelids which obstructed their seeing Lord Krishna. How were the eyelids obstructing our seeing? That Prabhupada explains, they could not tolerate, the gopis could not tolerate a moment's blinking of the eyes for it kept them from seeing their beloved Lord Krishna. When you blink, you have to keep blinking the eyes. So when you blink, for a moment, we are not able to see the object of affection. So the gopis felt that why has Brahma created these eyelids which momentarily stop us from seeing Krishna. So what to speak of others who are naturally very critical of every aspect of life, the action of a responsible man. Even the gopis, the perfectional devotees, they criticise Brahma for making these eyelids which block their vision of Krishna. So what to speak of others? So the conclusion is that anyone in a position of responsibility has to have that equanimity of mind to do the welfare work in spite of criticism from the very people whom they are trying to do welfare activity. Similarly, Maharaj Yudhishthira had to cross over many difficult situations created by his enemies and he proved to be the most perfect maintainer of mental equanimity in all critical circumstances. So, both are fitting comparisons

#### munificence, Lord Shiva, gifts, Ravana, power, misuse

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Shiva is a celebrated demigod who awards gifts to beggars."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to the comparison of Pariksit to Lord Shiva in terms of munificence, describing Shiva's generosity and using the example of Ravana to illustrate how easily obtained gifts can be misused.

for equanimity of mind. The next, Lord Shiva is described. Lord Shiva is a celebrated demigod who awards gifts to beggars. His name is therefore Ashutosh or one who is very easily pleased. He is also called Bhutanatha or the lord of the common folk who are mainly attached to him because of his munificent gifts even without consideration of the after effects. Shiva is liberal in giving gifts to whoever approaches him and begs for some particular benediction. Shiva liberally gives that. So, it is described here by Srila Prabhupada that Ravana was very attached to Lord Shiva and by easily pleasing him, Ravana became so powerful and he wanted to challenge the authority of Lord Rama. By Ravana's grace, Ravana became very visible and powerful. Lord Rama's grace was so great that Ravana became powerful. And he misused this power in challenging Lord Rama. Ravana was never helped by Lord Shiva when Ravana was fighting against Rama, because the Supreme Lord is not only Lord of everyone, he is also the Lord of Shiva. So when the battle was going on between Ravana and Rama, Shiva could not help Ravana. Then once Shiva awarded a benediction to one Asura by name Vrikasura. And this benediction was an awkward benediction and it was also very disturbing. Vrikasura became empowered by the grace of Lord Shiva to vanquish Ravana.

#### Lord Shiva, Vrikasura, benediction, Vishnu, illusion, generosity

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Lord Shiva never denies anyone any sort of gift. He is very liberal."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the discussion of Lord Shiva's generosity with the story of Vrikasura, who received a dangerous benediction from Shiva and was ultimately stopped by Vishnu, highlighting the potential downsides of indiscriminate giving.

Anyone's head simply by touching the head. This is the benediction that Vrikasura asked Shiva: whosoever head I touch, that person's head should immediately get cut off, just by its touch. So Shiva knew that this Asura is going to misuse this benediction. So when Shiva was refusing to give such a horrible benediction, then Vrikasura became very very restless, and he started cutting off the portions of flesh, his own flesh, and offering it to Shiva in sacrifice. So Shiva took compassion upon this foolish Asura and stopped him from killing himself in that way. And then Shiva had to give this stubborn Asura, Vrikasura, the benediction he wanted. Then what did he do? What did this fellow do, this Vrikasura, after he got the benediction? Although Shiva was the one who gave him the benediction, this cunning Asura, he wanted to make an experiment of the power of this benediction by touching the head of Lord Shiva. Thus Lord Shiva had to take shelter of Vishnu to save himself from this trouble. And Lord Vishnu, what did Vrikasura do? When Vrikasura went chasing, then Shiva took shelter of Vishnu and Vishnu confronted this Vrikasura. And by the illusory energy called Yogamaya, Vishnu was able to ask Vrikasura to make an experiment of this benediction by touching his own head. And so, Vrikasura under the illusion, he touched his own head to test whether the benediction is actually working or not. And in this way, Vishnu saved the whole world from the trouble being created by this cunning beggar of the demigods. So, why Prabhupada is narrating all this is because Lord Shiva never denies anyone any sort of gift. He is very liberal. He is therefore the most generous among the givers of benediction. Shiva is the most generous.

#### Lord Vishnu, protection, goddess of fortune, economic development, illusion

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Instead of seeking directly the protection of the goddess of fortune, one should seek the protection of Vishnu."
**Summary:** The speaker moves to the comparison of Pariksit to Lord Vishnu, emphasizing Vishnu's role as the maintainer of all living beings and the ultimate source of protection, even for the goddess of fortune, and contrasting this with the illusory nature of material economic development.

Although, sometimes some kind of mistake also happens in granting benediction. Then the next description is about Lord Vishnu. It is described here, Rama means the goddess of fortune, Yatha Devo Rama Shrayah, and her shelter, Rama Devi or Lakshmi Devi, her shelter is Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu is the maintainer of all living beings. There are innumerable living beings, not only on the surface of this planet, but also in all other hundreds of thousands of planets in this universe. All of them are provided with all necessities of life for the progressive march towards the end of self-realization. The Upanishads say, Eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman. That is the position of the Supreme Lord Vishnu or Krishna, that it is only the Supreme Lord who maintains all living beings. But, in spite of this protection by the Lord, Srila Prabhupada says, on the path of sense gratification, these living beings are put into difficulty by the agency of Maya, the illusory energy. When we violate the laws of nature or laws of God, and we encroach on somebody else's property, or we give trouble to others unnecessarily, then the illusory energy actually punishes such wrongdoers. And it's only under illusion that the living beings who are desirous of enjoying this material world, they are traversing the path of a false plan of economic development. Such economic development is never successful because it is illusory. So, instead of seeking directly the protection of the goddess of fortune, one should seek the protection of Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "Only Vishnu or his pure devotee can give protection to everyone."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that only Vishnu or his pure devotee can provide true protection, and that Pariksit Maharaj, being protected by Vishnu, would offer protection to those under his rule.

Because, even the goddess of fortune is sheltered by Vishnu. And therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, only Vishnu or his pure devotee can give protection to everyone. And therefore, it is predicted that Pariksit Maharaj, who was protected by Vishnu, himself would give all protection to people who wanted to live under his rule. In this way, it is being predicted about Pariksit.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verse, describing the inquiry of Maharaj Yudhishthira and the brahmanas' response about Parikshit's future qualities.

So three comparisons have been made in this particular verse. This comparison is being made by the brahmanas who are performing the jatakarma samskara of child Parikshit, just after his birth. And brahmanas are addressing Maharaj Yudhishthira, who was inquiring from the brahmanas, "Will this child be having good qualities when he grows up, and will he be a proper successor for me?" That's the enquiry made by Yudhishthira. And in response to that, the brahmanas are describing this child is going to grow up to be a great devotee, a pure devotee of the Lord, and he'll have wonderful qualities. And they're mentioning specifically those, what are those qualities.

**Key Quote:** "Sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Krishna's final instruction in the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Krishna and the difference between intelligent and less intelligent people in following this instruction.

So, as good as Lord Krishna by following in his footsteps. This is explained by Prabhupada in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says, the last instruction of Lord Sri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita is that, one should give up everything and should follow in the footsteps of the Lord alone. Sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja. This is Krishna's final instruction in the Bhagavad Gita, 18th chapter, 66th verse. Then further Srila Prabhupada says, less intelligent persons do not have the power to do good deeds. Less intelligent persons do not have the power to do good deeds. He said that, those who do not agree to this great instruction of the Lords, as ill luck would have it. So Srila Prabhupada is telling, unfortunately people don't agree to follow this instruction of Krishna. But, one who is actually intelligent catches up this sublime instruction and is immensely benefited. So, in this saying, spoke about, world there are two classes of people: intelligent people and not so intelligent people. So the less intelligent don't care to follow this particular instruction of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, the intelligent ones they agree to follow this great instruction of Krishna, the final instruction and they get immense benefit. So what is the benefit they get? That Prabhupada explains further: foolish people do not know that association is the cause of acquiring qualities. Association is the cause

of acquiring qualities. If I want to develop good qualities or acquire good qualities, I should associate with people or a person who has got all good qualities. Now who is the one who has got all good qualities? Two different classes of people have all good qualities. One is a pure devotee of the Lord. One class of persons who has all good qualities is a pure devotee of the Lord. Yasyasti bhaktir bhagavati akinchana sarvair gunai sthatra samasate surah, the statement of the Bhagavatam fifth canto: a pure devotee has all the good qualities that are to be found in the devatas, in the divine persons, divine qualities, all good qualities. And the second category is obviously the Supreme Lord who has unlimited good qualities. Samasta guna Gana dhama, this is the statement of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur that the Supreme Lord is full of all wonderful qualities.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Association with fire makes an object hot."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of fire to explain how association with Krishna leads to acquiring His qualities, mentioning that a jiva can attain 78% of the Lord's godly qualities through intimate association.

So this is further explained by Srila Prabhupada. How does it work? Prabhupad says association with fire makes an object even in the material sense proper. He is explaining how does it work. He gives an example: any object you bring it in contact with fire, the object becomes hot. Therefore association with the supreme personality of Godhead makes one qualified like the Lord. Since the Lord is full of all good qualities, if we associate with Krishna, the Supreme Lord, we also get all the good qualities of Krishna. Now as regards getting the good qualities, Srila Prabhupada specifically says here, now as we have discussed previously, this is discussed earlier in one earlier purport, one can achieve 78 percent of the godly qualities by the Lord's intimate association. Close association is required with the Lord to get 78 percent of godly qualities which are there in the Lord. Now why 78 percent? Why not hundred percent? So that's a different subject, we don't have time to discuss that. A jiva can get maximum of 78 percent of the qualities of the Lord's intimate association, emits of the Lord in a very, very, very, very minute quantity because we're tiny, the Lord is unlimited, we are infinity simile, Lord is infinite. So he has infinite qualities, but of them the common qualities that are we found among various categories of personalities in the whole cosmic manifestation, 78 percent of the utilities of Jesus are put in theıyı about the déjà vu etc. So the idea is to get the qualities or qualities we see can arrive from the Lord daaráne rú lo såoy球ês Toryácus venus101 values that are 고양 zú qualitas men zú lar Shield of the Prophets Thehee yoSLah of Her eаяă truths and great qualities 78% of the Lord's godly qualities can be acquired by a human being

**Summary:** The speaker explains that following the instructions of the Lord is equivalent to associating with Him due to the absolute nature of the Lord and His instructions (Advayagyana).

by intimate association with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now how to associate with the Lord? If that question is asked, Srila Prabhupada says, to follow the instructions of the Lord is to associate with the Lord. Why? Why is it said like this? Because the Lord is absolute. There is no difference between the Lord, His name, His form, His qualities, His instructions, there is no difference. Both are, all are absolute. Advayagyana, this is called Advayagyana. So there is no difference between the Lord and His instructions.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord is present everywhere and at all times."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that associating with Krishna is not about physical contact but about understanding His transcendental nature and omnipresence.

So to follow the instructions of the Lord means to associate with the Lord. Now, Srila Prabhupada also says that we should not mistakenly think to associate with Krishna is something like, a material presence. The Lord is not a material object whose presence one has to feel for such association. Like in our ordinary day to day dealings, material dealings, to associate means we think in terms of physical association, physical contact. But no, the Lord, you cannot have association with Krishna with krishna by physical contact, not possible. It's not possible because God is not at all having any material attributes, he does not have any material qualities or material characteristics. So with these material eyes we cannot see the transcendental form of the Lord, with our material senses we cannot perceive the presence of the Lord who is always transcendentally present, transcendentally available like that. And further Srila Prabhupada says the Lord is present everywhere and at all times. He is present everywhere because he is all-pervading and uh this is described in the Bhagavad-Gita, mayatatam idam sarvam jagat avyaktam i am all-pervading everywhere i am present krishna says in Bhagavad-Gita.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord can be present everywhere simultaneously."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the limited presence of jivas with the Lord's omnipresence as Brahman and Paramatma, reiterating that association with Him is possible by following His instructions.

So Lord is present everywhere and at all times eternally he is so always always is present he is not limited by time or space unlike us every jiva in this material world at least and even in the spiritual world we are present only in limited space and we are present in limited time even brahma even though he's got a fantastic long life span he also has to die with the divine presence with the dissolution of the entire universe at the end of brahma's lifespan case to die so nobody can remain in their material body forever neither even for the limited duration of time according to our lifespan we cannot be present everywhere simultaneously the lord can be present everywhere simultaneously not can he is he is present everywhere he is present everywhere as brahman and he is present everywhere as paramatma in this material world and therefore sheila prabhapa says it is quite possible to have his association simply by following his instruction

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Parikshit associated with the Lord even from the womb of his mother up to the last day of his valuable life."
**Summary:** The speaker returns to the topic of Parikshit, explaining how his association with Krishna began in the womb when Krishna saved him from the Brahmastra.

because the Lord and his instruction are all identical with him, being absolute knowledge, Advaya Gyan. Now, regarding Parikshit, what is being told here? Parikshit, it was told that this child will be almost as good as Lord Sri Krishna by following in his footsteps. So, it is said here that Maharaj Parikshit associated with the Lord even from the womb of his mother up to the last day of his valuable life. We discussed this earlier, when Parikshit was in his mother's womb, one Ashwatthama, son of Dronacharya, he attempted to kill this last surviving descendant of the Pandavas. And he was killed by releasing one Brahmastra. Now, Brahmastra, it goes and strikes the target wherever the target is. And only the target, nothing else. But, Parikshit was saved from this attack of Brahmastra by Krishna personally. And Krishna entered the womb of Parikshit's mother, Uttara, Abhimanyu's wife. So, Krishna entered personally and protected the child.

**Key Quote:** "Even though I am equal to everyone, but I am specially inclined to my pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing Krishna's special interest in His devotees and how Parikshit continued to associate with Krishna until the end of his life, ultimately acquiring all good qualities, ending with Hare Krishna.

Because Krishna has interest in the pure devotee, special interest. Ye bhajan titumam bhaktya maite teshu chaapyaham. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita. Even though I am equal to everyone, but I am specially inclined to my pure devotees. That's what Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita. So, accordingly, Krishna entered the womb of Mother Uttara, when Parikshit was present in that womb. And Krishna neutralized the Brahmastra and Parikshit was saved. And since that time, his association with Krishna began till the end of his life. The whole Bhagavatam is about Parikshit being cursed when he was ruling. He was cursed to die untimely, to die within seven days. And he accepted to quit the body after seven days. But he wanted to prepare. And he decided to go to holy place. And actually, Krishna prepared himself for quitting the body. And he had association of saintly persons, specially Srila Shukadeva Goswami, from whom he heard the Bhagavatam. So, till the end, he had association of Krishna in that way. And he acquired all good qualities of Krishna in all perfection. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "even lord sri krishna praised his acts of charity and hospitality this is the greatness of rantideva"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe Rantideva's virtues, including his acts of charity, hospitality, and adherence to religious principles, noting that he never ate flesh.

He was blessed by the great Vasishtamuni for supplying him cold water, and thus he achieved the heavenly planet, to be elevated to heavenly planet, just by being a king but acting properly by giving charity. Danam is one of the qualities of a kshatriya, ideal qualities of a kshatriya, and hospitality to receive the guests who come uninvited, unannounced, to receive them respectfully, properly, according to religious principles, to honor them, that is hospitality. So, Rantideva was famous for this. Although a kshatriya by birth, he never ate flesh in his entire life. The scriptures say kshatriyas under exceptional circumstances, they may eat a flesh of an animal, but Rantideva was a saintly king who never touched flesh of animal, never whole life he never did that. He is one of those pious kings whose names are remembered in the morning and evening.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Rantideva didn't strive for material gain but accepted what came through providence, but he always gave everything to guests, even undergoing suffering.

So, about Rantideva, in another part of the Bhagavatam, it's explained he never endeavored to earn anything, but he would enjoy whatever he got by the arrangement of providence. In the Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna says this is a characteristic of a yogi. Yogi means a devotee. So, Krishna says a devotee never endeavors for acquiring many things for his material subsistence, but he is satisfied with whatever is coming to him by arrangement of providence. Providence means higher arrangement. But still, there was an exception to this behavior Ranthideva. What is that? When guests came, he would give them everything he wanted had. Thus, he underwent considerable suffering along with his members of his family. On one occasion indeed, he and his family members shivered for want of food and water, yet Ranthi...

**Key Quote:** "because Ranthi Deva is perceived the presence of the supreme Godhead everywhere and in every living entity he received guests with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Rantideva breaking his 48-day fast and offering food to a Brahmana guest, demonstrating his unwavering hospitality and spiritual vision.

About Ranthi Deva, once after fasting for 48 days, in the morning Granthi Deva received some water and some foodstuffs made with milk and ghee. But when he and his family were about to eat, a Brahman and his family were about to eat a Brahman and his family were about to eat a Brahman, a guest arrived. Here the word used in Sanskrit for guest is atithi. Atithi means one who comes without invitation, without prior arrangement, without any intimation to the host, suddenly arrives. So, just Ranthi Deva is about to break his fast after 48 day fasting and the Brahmana guest is arrived. Because Ranthi Deva perceived the presence of the supreme Godhead everywhere and in every living entity, he received guests with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food. The Brahmana guest ate his share and then went away. So, the Brahmana guest was received properly even though Ranthi Deva was about to break the fast his faster 48 days. He remained sober. He never became disturbed, agitated. Properly received the guest, fed.

**Summary:** The story continues with Rantideva offering food to a Shudra guest, highlighting his spiritual vision of seeing everyone in relation to Krishna and demonstrating true equality.

Having divided the remaining food with his relatives, Ranthideva was just about to eat his own share when a Shudra guest arrived. So after feeding the Brahmana whatever was left he gave to all the relatives who were also fasting, his family members. And then he share he was about to eat. When a Shudra guest arrived is said, seeing the shudra in relationship with the supreme personality of godhead king rantideva gave him also a share of the food. See the magnanimity of rantideva how is he seeing? He's seeing everyone as spirit soul. This is the equality, not artificial equality that in terms of body trying to equalize everyone. No, body cannot be equalized, but within the body, the resident of the body, they he, not they ha not the body, they he, the occupant of the body, the resident of the body, the spirit soul within the body, that spirit soul is equal as part and parcel of Krishna. And therefore there is always a relationship between every living being and Krishna. So, Rantideva was enlightened spiritually, so he could see the relationship of every living being with Krishna and therefore he also gave this shudra guest a share of the food.

**Key Quote:** "rantideva offered the balance of the food to the dogs and the master of the dogs would come as guests the king offered them all respects and obeisances"
**Summary:** The speaker describes Rantideva offering food and respect to a guest with dogs, clarifying that this is based on spiritual vision and should not be imitated superficially, emphasizing the importance of cleanliness and proper discrimination.

When the shudra went away, another guest arrived surrounded by dogs and said, oh king, I and my company of dogs are very hungry, please give us something to eat. Now with great respect, Rantideva offered the balance of the food to the dogs and the master of the dogs would come as guests. The king offered them all respects and obeisances. Now offering obeisances to the master of the dogs is okay, but what about offering obeisances to the dogs? This is again seeing the spirit soul within the dog's body or the shudra's body or the master of the dog's body in relationship with Krishna. It is not to be imitated artificially by somebody who doesn't have a spiritual understanding. So people sometimes think that we can have the dog in our house by giving it a special protection. No, the dog can be given some food, but it has to wait outside your door and maybe it will do some service as guarding your house, that's okay, but not that you fondle the dog, make it sleep next to you in your own bed and allow it to roam everywhere in your and make your whole house unclean. Dog is the most unclean animal. So one should never allow a dog inside one's house to maintain cleanliness, but that doesn't mean one has to be cruel to the dog or negligent of the dog. No, a dog which requires some food you may give it food, but it has to wait outside your door. So, Ranthi Deva offered respect to the dog recognizing the living being inside, a spirit soul part and parcel of Krishna, not the dog's body or not the dogs consciousness, no not that. See this is a difference between Ranthi Deva treating equally all living beings and foolish people who want to imitate equality of all living beings by being particularly attached to a dog or a cat even though they seem to be very compassionate to some dog or cat, but they don't offer the same hospitality or treatment to another fellow human being who may be in need of.

**Summary:** The story culminates with Rantideva offering his last portion of water to a Chandala, expressing his desire to alleviate the suffering of all beings, showcasing his ultimate magnanimity.

Thereafter, so he offered the balance of the food to the dogs and the master of the dogs and then only the drinking water remained, his share, Ranthi Deva share after fasting 48 days and there is only enough to satisfy one person. When the king was just about to drink that water, a chandala appeared and said, Oh King, although I am lowborn, kindly give me some drinking water because I am very thirsty. See how Ranthi Deva has being tested. And then agree that hearing the pitiable words of the poor fatigue chandala Maharaj ranthi deva spoke the following nectarian words. What did he say? I do not pray to the Supreme Personality of God it for the eight perfections of mystic yoga not for Salvation from repeated birth and death I want to only stay out of the difamento der 愛 hablar dasi ben beber stay a little bit of rest will bring Allah to those living beings but as long as you live to see being healed by the highest self and remembrance of the یا among all the living beings and suffer all distress on their behalf so that they may be freed from suffering. See how very magnanimous and there is a comparison ranthi deva eva udara is as magnanimous he'll be as magnanimous this pariksit as ranthi deva. Ranthi Deva had that feeling that I don't want to see anybody else suffer and I want to remain among them and actually suffered distresses on their behalf so that they may be freed from suffering. This is very very very magnanimous quality. Having spoken thus, Ranthi Deva although on the verge of death because of thirst gave his own portion of water to the chandala.

**Summary:** The demigods reveal themselves, pleased with Rantideva's generosity, and Rantideva prays for devotion to Lord Vishnu, reinforcing the theme of magnanimity and its connection to spiritual realization; the speaker concludes by reiterating that Parikshit will be as magnanimous as Rantideva.

And soul and then what happened? The demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva, they had disguised themselves and appeared as the brahmana, the shudra, the master of the dogs and the chandala. They disclosed their identity and they said we are very pleased with your generosity, with your magnanimity, kindly ask us any benediction. Ranthi Deva had no ambition to enjoy any material benefits, so he simply prayed that I may always be fixed at the Lotus feet of Lord Vishnu in devotion to the supreme. So this is the magnanimity of Ranthi Deva and child Pariksit is foretold to be as magnanimous.

**Summary:** The speaker begins to narrate the history of Maharaja Yati, focusing on his early life, his lustful desires, and his relationship with Devayani, the daughter of Shukracharya.

part, we will discuss the comparison with Maharaja Yati. So, Srila Prabhupada in the purport gives a brief history of this great King Yati. The great emperor of the world and the original forefather of all great nations of the world who belong to the Aryan and Indo-European stock. Yati is a great forefather of all races in this world. He is the son of Maharaja Nahusha, and he became the emperor of the world due to his elder brothers becoming a great and liberated saintly mystic. He ruled over the world for several thousands of years and performed many sacrifices and pious activities recorded in history. This is the greatness of this Maharaja Yati. He was Dharmikaha. He was a strict follower of religious principles. For a king, the most important religious principle is to perform sacrifices as prescribed for a Kshatriya or a king in the scriptures and ensure the welfare of the entire kingdom or the entire planet of all the people. So, because in the Bhagavad Gita it is said all necessities are provided by the Supreme Lord. If people perform sacrifices, especially the King, the leader of all the people in this world, the ruler, if he performs sacrifices, then people will get their necessities without any difficulty. Now regarding Yati, there is a mention here by Srila Prabhupada, even though he's famous for having performed a lot of sacrifices and many pious activities. In his early youth, he was very lustful and full of lusty desires for enjoying young girls. He fell in love with Devayani, the most beloved daughter of Shukracharya. Who is Shukracharya? Shukracharya is the spiritual master of the demons, the Asuras. And he was a Brahmana, qualified Brahmana, Shukracharya. His daughter Devayani somehow. That is explained in another part of the Bhagavatam. I will try to say

**Key Quote:** "Sharmishta threw her, threw Devayani into a well and left her there and went away with her other friends."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story, detailing the incident where Sharmishta throws Devayani into a well, leading to Yayati rescuing her and the subsequent conflict involving Shukracharya.

in brief, narrate in brief. Shukracharya's daughter, Devayani, had a girlfriend named Sharmishta before her marriage with Yayati. Now, this Sharmishta, the friend of Devayani, was the daughter of one king Vrishapurva. Once it so happened, Sharmishta was sporting in the water with thousands of her girlfriends, and Devayani was also there with Sharmishta, sporting in the water. When the young girls saw Lord Shiva seated on his bull carrier with Uma or Parvati, they immediately dressed themselves because they were sporting in water, they had left their dress outside the bank of the water reservoir. Suddenly they saw Shiva, and to respect him, immediately they covered themselves. But Sharmishta mistakenly put on Devayani's clothes because they were in a hurry. Now Devayani became very angry at Sharmishta and rebuked her. Now Sharmishta responded by rebuking Devayani, and not only did she rebuke her, but Sharmishta also threw her, threw Devayani into a well and left her there and went away with her other friends. She was the daughter of the king, so she was very proud of her special position. So she ill-treated Devayani. By chance, when Devayani was trapped in that well, King Yayati came on a hunting expedition, and he came searching for water. By chance, he found Devayani and rescued her, and in this way, Devayani accepted Maharaj Yayati as her husband. But before accepting Yayati as husband, Devayani crying loudly told her father Shukracharya about Sharmishta's behavior. But before accepting Yayati as husband, Devayani crying loudly told her father Shukracharya about Sharmishta's behavior. But before accepting Yayati as husband, Devayani crying loudly told her father Shukracharya about Sharmishta's behavior. But before accepting Yayati as husband, Devayani crying loudly told her father Shukracharya about Sharmishta's behavior.

Now Shukracharya was very angry at Sharmishta, and he went to King Vrishapurva and complained that your daughter has insulted my daughter. Now Shukracharya was very angry at Sharmishta, and he went to King Vrishapurva and complained that your daughter has insulted my daughter. Now Shukracharya was very angry at Sharmishta, and he went to King Vrishapurva and complained that your daughter has insulted my daughter.

**Key Quote:** "Shukracharya again became angry against Maharaja Yati and he cursed Yati to become old."
**Summary:** The story progresses with Shukracharya cursing Yati to become old due to Devayani's envy and anger over Sharmishta's pregnancy.

So because Shukracharya was the Brahmana advisor to the king, the king was very afraid that Shukracharya would leave and go away. So he pacified and said, "My daughter Sharmishta will actually become the maidservant of your daughter Devayani." So then Shukracharya was satisfied. He did not chastise Vrishaparva or Vrishaparva's daughter Sharmishta. So then Sharmishta, after the marriage of Devayani with Maharaja Yati, went with Devayani as Devayani's maidservant to Maharaja Yati's palace. Now, when Sharmishta found that her friend Devayani had a son through Maharaja Yati, she also desired to have a son, and she requested Maharaja Yati for sex. And when Sharmishta became pregnant, Devayani became very envious. Devayani became very envious of her maidservant becoming pregnant, and in great anger, she left Maharaja Yati and went away to her father's house and narrated everything that happened to her father, Shukracharya. Shukracharya again became angry against Maharaja Yati, and he cursed Yati to become old. When he was just still young, he was cursed to become old. When he was just still young, he was cursed to become old. When he was just still young, he was cursed to become old and invalid.

**Key Quote:** "These material desires for enjoyment of lust are like a fire."
**Summary:** Yati exchanges his old age with his son Puru, enjoys material life, and eventually becomes disgusted, using the analogy of a goat to illustrate the insatiable nature of lust.

And then Yati became very, very morose naturally, that he had lost his youth when he had not actually grown sufficiently by age. So he begged Shukracharya, "Do something about my youth. How can I regain youth? I have not yet satisfied my desires for enjoyment, material enjoyment. Kindly give me back my youth." So then Shukracharya gave him the benediction that he could transfer his old age to someone else, some young man, and thereby get back the youth. So Yati exchanged his old age for his youngest son, Puru. So Yati exchanged his old age for his youngest son, Puru, and thus he was able to enjoy with young girls. Now after many, many years of enjoyment in the material world, Yati finally became disgusted with this material enjoyment. When satiated, he devised his story corresponding to his own life and narrated that story before his beloved wife Devayani. and narrated that story before his beloved wife Devayani. and narrated that story before his beloved wife Devayani. The story is described in the Bhagavatam as follows. Once upon a time, this is Yayati telling Devayani this story. Once upon a time, there was a goat who was searching in a forest for different types of vegetables to eat, and by chance, this goat came to a well. And in that well, the goat saw a she-goat. He became attracted to the she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and they were united. Thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another she-goat, she became angry, abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her brahmana owner to whom she described. The brahmana became angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual power. Thereupon, the he-goat begged the brahmana's pardon and was given back the power for sex. Then the he-goat enjoyed sex with the she-goat for many years, but still, he was not satisfied. If one is lusty and greedy, even the total stock of gold in the entire world cannot be sold. The he-goat cannot satisfy one's lusty desires.

**Key Quote:** "King Yayati, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons."
**Summary:** Yati renounces worldly life, engages in devotional service, and the speaker concludes by comparing Pariksit to Yati in terms of religiousness and charity.

This is the conclusion of Maharajayati. He says, "These material desires for enjoyment of lust are like a fire. One may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished because of pouring clarified butter. Such a fire, one must adopt a different process." The shastra therefore advises that by intelligence one renounces the life of enjoyment. So, now those who are not sufficiently intelligent, they cannot give up sense enjoyment because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned woman. because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned woman. King Yayati, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons. He personally adopted the life of a mendicant, giving up all attraction to material enjoyment, and engaged himself fully in devotional service to the Lord. Thus he attained perfection. So, this is the history of Yayati described in the Bhagavatam. This Yayati, even while he was ruling, he performed many sacrifices and ensured the prosperity for everyone in his kingdom, and he was also engaged in very many pious activities by which he gave a lot of charity. So, in this respect, Pariksit is compared to King Yayati that Pariksit will be as magnanimous, sorry, as religious and as charitable as Maharaj Yayati, who is famous in history for being very religious minded.

**Key Quote:** "This child will be like Bali Maharaj in patience, a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna like Prahlad Maharaj, a performer of many Ashwamedha sacrifices, and a follower of the old and experienced men."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 25th verse of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the qualities of Pariksit, particularly his patience compared to Bali Maharaj, who is one of the 12 authorities in devotional service.

In this session we will be discussing from the 25th verse of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This will be discussed in two parts. So in this session we will discuss part 2. The verse, 25th verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: This child will be like Bali Maharaj in patience, a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna like Prahlad Maharaj, a patient devotee of Lord Krishna like Prahlad Maharaj, a performer of many Ashwamedha sacrifices, and a follower of the old and experienced men. Four different qualities are glorified about Pariksit by the brahmanas while foretelling about the greatness of the child when he grows up. So the first comparison is made that this child will be like Bali Maharaj in patience. So the history of Bali Maharaj is described as this, described again in the Bhagavatam in detail, great detail in the 8th canto, in connection with the pastime of Lord Vamanthi. So Srila Prabhupada says, one of the 12 authorities, Bali Maharaj is one of the 12 authorities in devotional service of the Lord, Mahajana Dvadash Mahajana. Bali Maharaj is a great authority in devotional service because he sacrificed everything to please the Supreme Lord and relinquished the connection with the Lord. He sacrificed everything to please the Supreme Lord and relinquished the connection with the Lord. He has a close connection with the so called spiritual master who obstructed him on the parts of risking everything for the service of the Supreme Lord. Now in the brief history of Bali Maharaj, because the comparison is made, how great was Bali Maharaj in being very, very patient, being very patient, that's how this Pariksit will also be very patient.

**Key Quote:** "So, Vaman Dev was received very respectfully by Bali Maharaj as a Brahmachari boy."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Vamanadeva's appearance as a Brahmachari and his visit to Bali Maharaj's sacrificial arena, highlighting Bali's respectful reception and offer of charity.

So the description is, so the description is that the Supreme Lord appeared as Vaman Dev, as the son of Aditi and Kashyapa and he particularly came on the request of Aditi. So, Vaman Dev wanted to satisfy Aditi's desire that Aditi's sons headed by Indra who had lost their kingdom to Bali Maharaj, they get back their kingdom. So, Vaman Dev came to actually restore Indra's kingdom by taking it away in a way of tricking Bali Maharaj and Vaman Dev took away from Bali Maharaj by trickery and gave it to Indra. So, what was Bali's reaction to all this? That is very nicely described here. So, Vaman Dev as soon as he appeared, he disguised himself as a small Brahmachari boy and visited the sacrificial arena where Bali Maharaj was performing sacrifices. Now, Vaman Dev appeared in the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaj with his transcendentally effulgent form. Because he is the Supreme Lord, his form is full of transcendental effulgence called Brahmajyoti. So, normally the Lord in the material world will not display his Brahmajyoti. Then nobody will be able to see him. So, he partially displayed his transcendental effulgence and all the priests in that sacrificial arena they stood up from their seats and offered all respects and prayers to this Brahmachari. Of course, they didn't know it is Vaman Dev. So, they thought some very, very, very austere Brahmachari, some great personality. We do not know who he is. He has appeared with this effulgence which is very, very dazzling. And they stood up in respect and offered prayers to him. Now, so Vaman Dev was received very respectfully by Bali Maharaj as a Brahmachari boy. And Bali immediately washed the feet of this Brahmachari who is Lord himself as Vaman Dev and sprinkled that water that washes the feet of the Brahmachari on his head. And then Bali Maharaj inquired Vaman Dev that you may ask me for some dana. Either you may ask for some money or jewels or anything else you might desire. Because I am the emperor of the world. So, you may ask me anything that you desire.

**Key Quote:** "Even if this Brahmachari is Vishnu. And even if he is going to take away everything I possess still, I do not want to go back on my promise."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story, describing Vamanadeva's request for three paces of land, Bali Maharaj's willingness to grant it, and Shukracharya's warning, followed by Bali's decision to uphold his promise despite the potential consequences.

Now, Vaman Dev praised Bali Maharaj. And Vaman Dev actually asked Bali Maharaj that I will be satisfied with just three paces of land measured by my footprint. A small Brahmachari boy, how much will his footprint be? So, Bali Maharaj thought this Brahmachari, even though he is so bright and effulgent and very, very, very austere, he does not have sufficient experience what to ask. So, Bali Maharaj said I can give you something much more than that. And he offered to give more. But Vaman Dev described to Bali Maharaj that one should be satisfied with the minimum necessities. Otherwise, there is no end to one's desire for possessing more and more and more. So, then Bali Maharaj hearing this enlightening words from this Brahmachari, he became very impressed and said, Oh, you are very, very learned and even realized. Okay, according to your desire, whatever you want, I am ready to give you, offer you in charity. I will give you three steps of land measured by your footprint. So, then when he is about to accept to give, agree to give, immediately Shukracharya stopped him. Stop. My dear King, please stop. What is the matter? So, then Shukracharya said, You do not know who this Brahmachari boy is. He is actually Vishnu disguised as a Brahmachari boy. He has come here on behalf of the devatas, our enemies. And he has come to take away your entire kingdom, on the plea of taking three steps of land in charity, he is going to take away your entire kingdom. So, beware, do not give what he is asking for in charity, because he has come to cheat you. So, then Bali Maharaj heard Shukracharya and he considered that Bali Maharaj thought it is the duty of a householder to maintain the principles of religion. And he thought it improper to withdraw his promise to the Brahmachari. Even if this Brahmachari is Vishnu. And even if he is going to take away everything I possess still, I do not want to go back on my promise, because lying is a sinful activity. So, I should not go back on my promise. And therefore, I want to give this Brahmachari whatever I have promised.

The lecture ends by connecting Bali's patience to the future patience of Pariksit.

So, then when Bali Maharaj was deprived of all his possessions then all the associates of Bali Maharaj became angry at this Brahmachari boy who cheated Bali. And they wanted to attack this Brahmachari boy who is now in this form, universal form. And they attempted but immediately Vishnu's associates defeated all the associates of Bali Maharaj and sent them to the lower planets. And then Bali Maharaj was arrested by the ropes of Varuna by Garuda the carrier of Lord Vishnu. But when Lord Vishnu said to Bali Maharaj you have not fulfilled your promise to give me three steps of land. Where do I place my third step? So, then Bali Maharaj, he explained to Lord Vamana, Lord Vishnu that I have given away whatever is my possession. But I am still there. So, I will give my head in charity as the place for Lord Vishnu's third step. Now, that was very very pleasing to Lord Vishnu. Look at the patience of Bali Maharaj. He is completely bereft of all his possessions. He has been taken, all his possessions have been taken away and he is nothing. And still he is offering his own self, Atma Nivedanam. Of course, Bali Maharaj is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. So, the Lord performed this pastime to glorify Bali Maharaj and show to the whole world that my devotees are so very dedicated to my seva, that they are willing to give up everything just to please me, to satisfy me, to serve me. In this way, Bali Maharaj proved to be very very successful in his conduct as giving charity. So, his patience was tested by Lord Vamana Dev and he became successful. So, similarly Pariksit also will be very very patient. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada says a perfect devotee of Lord Krishna, his father, Prahlad's father, Hiranyakashyapu, chastised him severely when he was only five years old, for his becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker begins narrating the history of Prahlad Maharaj, highlighting his devotion to Lord Krishna and the opposition he faced from his father, Hiranyakashipu.

So, in a purport, Srila Prabhupada says about Prahlad Maharaj, he gives a brief description of the history of Prahlad Maharaj. Prabhupada says, "A perfect devotee of Lord Krishna, his father, Prahlad's father, Hiranyakashyapu, chastised him severely when he was only five years old, for his becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord." This is the history of Prahlad Maharaj. So, the details of Prahlad Maharaj's history is given in the seventh canto of the Bhagavatam. So, I will try to narrate in brief some more details about the history of Prahlad Maharaj. It is said in the seventh canto that by severe austerities, this demon Hiranyakashipu satisfied Lord Brahma and obtained the benedictions he desired. Nonetheless, he continued to be envious of Lord Vishnu. He conquered the three worlds. He brought all living entities, both demigods and asuras, under his control. All the demigods except Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma, and Lord Shiva came under his control and began serving him. Practically, Hiranyakashipu terrorized the whole universe. Since Hiranyakashipu was the oppressor of all the demigods and envious of the Supreme Lord, he would naturally be killed. Hiranyakashipu had four sons, of whom the eldest, Prahlad, was a Mahabhagavata. Hiranyakashipu's spiritual master, Shukracharya, had two sons, Shanda and Amarka. Now, Prahlad Maharaj was entrusted to Shanda and Amarka for education.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Prahlad's disinterest in material education and his continued devotion to Krishna, even teaching his teachers about the falsity of ownership.

Although the teachers tried to educate the boy Prahlad Maharaj in politics, economics, and other material activities, he did not care for their instructions. Instead, Prahlad continued to be a pure devotee. Prahlad never liked the idea of discriminating between one's friends and enemies, because he was spiritually inclined, he was equal to everyone. Once upon a time, Hiranyakashipu inquired from his son Prahlad what was the best thing that Prahlad had learned from the teachers. So, Prahlad Maharaj replied that a man engrossed in material consciousness of duality, thinking this is mine and something else belongs to an enemy, such a person should give up his householder life and go to the forest to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Hiranyakashipu heard this from his son, speaking about devotion and service, Hiranyakashipu decided this small boy has been polluted by some friend in school. So, he advised the teacher to take care of the boy so that he would not become a devotee of Krishna. However, when the teachers inquired from Prahlad why he was going against their teachings, Prahlad taught the teachers that the mentality of ownership is false and that he was therefore trying to become an unalloyed devotee of the Lord Vishnu.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the escalating conflict between Prahlad and Hiranyakashipu, including Hiranyakashipu's attempts to kill Prahlad due to his devotion to Vishnu.

The teachers, being very angry, chastised and threatened the boy with many fearful conditions. They taught him to the best of their ability and then brought him before his father. So, Hiranyakashipu affectionately took his son Prahlad on his lap and then inquired from him what was the best thing that he had learned from his teachers. As usual, Prahlad Maharaj began praising the nine processes of devotional service such as Shravanam and Kirtanam, Vishnu. The king of the demons, Hiranyakashipu, being extremely angry, chastised the teachers, Shanda and Amarka, for having wrongly trained Prahlad Maharaj. The so-called teachers informed King Hiranyakashipu that Prahlad Maharaj was automatically a devotee and did not listen to their instructions at all. When they proved themselves innocent, Hiranyakashipu inquired from Prahlad, where have you learned about Vishnu Bhakti? Prahlad Maharaj's reply was very profound. Prahlad Maharaj said, those who are attached to family life do not develop Krishna consciousness, either personally or collectively. Instead, they suffer repeated birth and death in the material world and continue simply chewing the chewed. Prahlad explained that the duty of every man is to take shelter of a pure devotee and thus become eligible to understand Krishna consciousness. Hiranyakashipu became angry. He was very, very angry hearing this answer. He threw this small boy down from his lap. Since Prahlad was so treacherous that he had become a devotee of Vishnu, who had killed his uncle Hiranyakashipu, Hiranyakashipu asked his assistants to kill him.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Prahlad's divine protection despite Hiranyakashipu's relentless attempts to harm him, highlighting Hiranyakashipu's lack of understanding.

Now, the assistants of Hiranyakashipu struck Prahlad with sharp weapons, threw him under the feet of elephants, subjected him to hellish conditions, threw him from the peak of a mountain, tried to kill him in thousands of other ways, but were always unsuccessful. Hiranyakashipu therefore became increasingly afraid of his son Prahlad and arrested him. Can you imagine? A small five-year-old boy, he is just innocently practicing bhakti, Vishnu bhakti, and his father is so angry, he is trying to kill the boy. And even after being unsuccessful, nothing is striking him that this boy is completely protected. Nobody can do anything to the boy because he is protected by the Supreme Lord. Hiranyakashipu is not understanding this point. But the sons of Shukracharya, Chandana Marka, or the teachers of Prahlad, they pacified Hiranyakashipu and told, "We will still try to change his mind. He is after all a small boy. He is speaking based on whatever he knows from the past. So we will try to change his mind as he grows up. Don't worry."

So, while the teachers were absent from the classroom, Prahlad began to preach Krishna Consciousness to the classmates. And following the instructions of Prahlad, all the sons of the demons who were Prahlad's classmates became attached to Lord Vishnu. When this attachment became pronounced, Shanda and Amarka were very afraid that the boys would become more and more devoted to Lord Vishnu. In a helpless condition, they approached Hiranyakashipu and described in detail the effect of Prahlad's preaching. After hearing of this, Hiranyakashipu decided to kill his son Prahlad personally. Hiranyakashipu was so angry that Prahlad Maharaj fell down at his feet and said things like, just to pacify him. But Prahlad was unsuccessful in satisfying his father. Hiranyakashipu, as a typical demon, began to advertise himself as being greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vishnu. But Prahlad Maharaj challenged him saying that Hiranyakashipu was not God. And Prahlad began to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Vishnu, declaring that Lord Vishnu is all-pervading. Everything is under his control. No one is equal to or greater than Lord Vishnu. Thus he requested his father, please be submissive to the Omnipotent Supreme Lord. The more Prahlad glorified Vishnu, the more angry and agitated

Suddenly, there issued a tumultuous sound and the Supreme Lord in his wonderful form of Narasimha, half man, half lion, came out of the pillar.

The Lord performed some pastime of fighting with the demon for some time. And in the evening, the border between day and night, the Supreme Lord captured the demon, threw him on his lap, and killed him by piercing his abdomen with his nails and tearing apart his body into pieces. Then the associates of Hiranyakashipu came to attack Lord Narasimha, but Lord Narasimha easily killed every one of them.

**Key Quote:** "The wisest man in the world is a devotee of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the wisest person is a devotee of the Lord and discusses the lineage of wise kings in Maharaja Yudhishthira's family.

The wisest man in the world is a devotee of the Lord. Ye Krishna bhaje se bada chatura. Also Krishna says, Tesham satata yuktaanam bhajatam pritipurvakam dadami buddhi yogam tam. So the wisest man is always a devotee of the Supreme Lord. The sages are called wise men and there are different types of wise men for different branches of knowledge. Unless therefore the king or the head of the state is the wisest man, he cannot control all types of wise men in the state. So Prabhupada is explaining what is the necessity for the king to be the wisest because he is to control different types of wise people in the state. In the line of royal succession in the family of Maharaja Yudhishthira, all the kings without exception were the wisest men of their times. And so also it is foretold about Maharaja Pariksit and his son Maharaja Janamejaya who was yet to be born. Such wise kings can become chastisers of upstarts and uprooters of kali or quarrelsome.

Kali Purusha, personified kali, was trying to enter the kingdom of Pariksit Maharaj. When Pariksit Maharaj is ruling, that is going to be described in the next few chapters. And this Kali Purusha was chastised severely by Pariksit Maharaj. Why? Because this Kali Purusha was trying to kill a cow. It was unheard of, unknown during Pariksit Maharaj's time. Nobody would even hurt a cow in any minor way. Forget about killing a cow, that was unknown. But in such a place, at such a time, Kali Purusha attempting to kill a cow was intolerable.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the symptoms of Kali Yuga and contrasts them with the four pillars of Dharma in Satya Yuga, explaining how irreligion destroys these pillars.

And Srila Prabhupada says further, the symptoms of kali are wine, women, gambling and slaughterhouses. Four symptoms of kali yuga. What are they? Wine, women, gambling, slaughterhouses. This is explained very nicely in the later chapter that in the Satya yuga, as opposed to kali yuga. The four legs of dharma were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. The Sanskrit words are Tapa, Shaucha, Daya, Satya. Tapa means austerity, Shaucha means cleanliness, dhaya means mercy and Satya means truthfulness. So, religion stands on four legs of four pillars. These are the four pillars. And these four are destroyed by rampant irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women, intoxication and...

**Key Quote:** "With the progression of the age of Kali people are becoming very proud they are becoming attached to women and they are attached to intoxication"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how pride, lust, and intoxication are rampant in Kali Yuga, leading to corruption and moral degradation.

with the progression of the age of Kali, people are becoming very proud, they are becoming attached to women and they are attached to intoxication. So Srila Prabhupada gives example, by the influence of the age of Kali even a pauper is proud of his penny. People may have very little wealth but they think they are very, very rich or they're very, very wealthy. The women are always dressed in an overly attractive fashion to victimize the minds of men and of course there are lusty people, the men who want to exploit and enjoy women, but still women also, they are, though at least the ones who are not conducting themselves in the outside world properly, they are also inciting the lasty men to actually attack them. And people are addicted to drinking wine, they're addicted to smoking, they are addicted to drinking tea, chewing tobacco, etc. This is their addiction to intoxicants, different varieties. All these habits are so-called advancement of civilization are the root causes of all irreligiousity. Why are people becoming indifferent to religion? Why are they not following religious principles? Because they are victims of habits, bad habits, particularly these bad habits in Kaliyuga. So you can't explain such people to have good behavior, you can't expect them to have good moral character, you can't expect them to be civilized, no, that's not possible. And because of irreligiosity it is not possible to check corruption, bribery and...

**Summary:** The speaker suggests that the solution to these problems lies in promoting Brahmanical culture and the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy, and truthfulness.

consequently they resort to taking bribes, cheating, plundering, becoming corrupt and earning money by dishonest means like that. So Prashula Prabhupada says, man cannot check all these evils simply by statutory acts and police vigilance, but the people can be cured of these evils by advocating the principles of Brahmanical culture or the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, Tapa, Shaucha, Daya, Satya. So actually Srila Prabhupada says that religion is not based on some sentiment or some feeling that I belong to such and such a community or some caste, no, that is not real religion. Real religion is based on these four factual principles. It doesn't matter where one has taken birth or it doesn't matter whether somebody claims to be a Hindu or a Christian or a Muslim or a Atheist. These things don't matter. It is actually based on these four...

**Key Quote:** "The solution to this problem is to create a new society... and educate them in god consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes modern civilization for creating poverty and irreligion, advocating for a new society based on God consciousness.

Only then in the society there will be peace, there will be prosperity, there will be harmony or it's not possible. So Srila Prabhupada says modern civilization and economic development are creating a new situation of poverty and scarcity with the result of blackmailing the consumer's commodities. This is the effect of so-called advancement of civilization. People are becoming more and more addicted to these bad. They are becoming more and more irreligious which means they don't follow the principles of austerity, tenderness, mercy and truthfulness. So the whole atmosphere is surcharged with all bad qualities. So how can you expect peace and prosperity in such an atmosphere? So Srila Prabhupada says the solution to this problem is to create a new society. The solution to these problems is that the leaders and rich men of society should spend 50% of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of people and educate them in god consciousness, the knowledge of Srimad Bhagavatam so that Kali will be defeated in its attempt to trap the conditioned souls.

**Key Quote:** "We have to defeat Kali by spreading Sankirtana, the chanting of the holy name of God. So that is the only solution."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of Sankirtana and following the example of Maharaj Pariksit to maintain peace and morality, ending the lecture with Hare Krishna.

Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says wise rulers of all states should take lessons from Maharaj Pariksit in how to maintain peace and morality by subduing the upstarts and quarrelsome people who indulge in wine, illicit connection with women, gambling and meat eating supplied by regularly maintained slaughterhouses. This has to stop. It's not that there was no meat eating in the former times, but it was restricted, highly restricted, and there was no mass killing of animals, open sale of meat or liquor. No, this was never there in the former times. So some few people would indulge in these very, very... A hidden way. So that was the situation in the former times. But now it has become very much rampant in the society and openly they're selling, advertising, making propaganda. Come, enjoy, eat, drink, be merry. The hedonistic philosophy, which is going to ruin the whole society. So therefore we should adopt the principles followed by Maharaj Pariksit and thereby create a good atmosphere of peace and prosperity through the method suggested here by Srila Prabhupada. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "He will free himself from all material attachment and surrender to the Supreme Lord taking complete shelter of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about Parikshit Maharaj knowing his death in advance and surrendering to the Lord.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 27th verse of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Takshakad Atmano Mrtyum Dvija Putropasarjithat Prapatsyata Upashrutya Muktasangapadam Harehe. The meaning of this verse is: After hearing about his death, which will be caused by the bite of a snake bird sent by a son of a brahmana, he will get himself freed from all material attachment and surrender unto the personality of Godhead, taking shelter of Him. So, this foretold about this child Parikshit that he will know about his death in advance. 7 days before his death, he will come to know about his death because he will come to know that he has been cursed by a brahmana boy to be bitten by a snake bird. And upon hearing of his death, what will be his reaction? He will free himself from all material attachment and surrender to the Supreme Lord, taking complete shelter of the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Material attachment means ignorance of transcendental happiness under the shelter of the Lord taking shelter of the Lord means one will be completely in spiritual bliss they'll not care for anything material"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the incompatibility of material attachment and taking shelter of the Lord, emphasizing the bliss of spiritual life.

So, you can see this story from here. For preparing to quit the body and go back to Godhead, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport: material attachment and taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord don't go together. I mean, they don't go together. If somebody is materially attached, they cannot take shelter of the Supreme Lord's lotus feet, and one who has taken shelter of the Lord's lotus feet cannot have any material attachment. So, material attachment means ignorance of transcendental happiness under the shelter of the Lord. Taking shelter of the Lord means one will be completely in spiritual bliss. They'll not care for anything material. They'll never seek any material happiness. They'll understand that material happiness is illusory, insignificant, momentary, worthless. So, a factual devotee who has tasted even a glimpse of what is spiritual happiness, transcendental bliss, never will turn towards anything material.

**Key Quote:** "Eternally we are related to Krishna as this part and parcel, inseparable part."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the practice of devotion, our eternal relationship with Krishna, and how it leads to freedom from material attachment, highlighting Parikshit Maharaj's early Krishna consciousness.

So, devotion to material happiness is not a material happiness; it is a spiritual happiness. So, the unconditional service to the Lord while existing in the material world is a way to practice one's transcendent relation with the Lord. I am explaining what is this position of a practicing devotee who's not yet pure. It is a way to practice one's transcendent relation with the Lord. One has got an eternal connection or relationship to the one which links you with Krishna, every living being. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita: mamayivamsho jeevaloke jeevabhutasanatanah. Eternally, we are related to Krishna as His part and parcel, inseparable part. When one's practice of bhakti is matured, one gets completely free from all material attachment and becomes competent to go back home, back to Godhead. So, Maharaj Pariksit, being especially attached to the Lord from the beginning of his body, from the beginning in the womb of his mother, was continuously under the shelter of the Lord, even before he came to know of his death, right from the time he was in the womb of his mother. You have heard this earlier, but I will repeat, that when he was in the womb of his mother, Ashwatthama attempted to kill this child in the womb itself by releasing one's brahmastra to strike the target of the child in the mother's womb, Pariksit, to kill the last surviving descendant of the Pandavas. Ashwatthama attempted this, but Ashwatthama was completely unsuccessful because Krishna personally entered the womb of Pariksit's mother and saved the child by

neutralizing that brahmastra. At that time, Pariksit had darshan. For a brief moment, he had darshan of the Supreme Lord. And ever since, he became so much attached and attracted to that beautiful form of Krishna which he saw in his mother's womb, and he was always searching, where is this person or this beautiful personality I have seen? I want to see him. I am searching for him, searching, searching. So, he became known as the examiner, Pariksit. That's how he got that name, Pariksit, examiner. He is examining everybody. Are you the person I have seen? Are you the person I have seen? Are you the person I have seen? So, he is searching for Krishna, because Krishna is so attractive. So, being in the womb of the Supreme Lord, being an examiner, always he was Krishna conscious. So, he was always continuously Krishna conscious and therefore under the shelter of Lord Krishna, even before he got notice of death. But when he got the warning of his death within seven days, that was the end of his life. That curse of the Brahmana proved to be a boon to him, to enable him to prepare himself to go back to Godhead. Now, briefly I will just mention what happened.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the incident of Parikshit Maharaj insulting Shamika Rishi and his subsequent repentance.

As regards the curse by the Brahmana boy, Pariksit, as the emperor of the world, he was ruling from his capital city, Hastinapura. He once went hunting, because the Kshatriyas had to practice killing to keep themselves fit for giving protection to the citizens. So, he went hunting and he became thirsty. He started searching for water. He came across the ashram of one Shamika Rishi. He went inside that ashram and he saw that there was a sage sitting there, half-closed eyes. The sage was in meditation. So, the sage was not conscious of his externals. But Pariksit, being very thirsty, not finding water, not being welcomed by this sage, he mistook the sage to be feigning to be meditating in order to avoid receiving the king. So, Pariksit became angry. He took one dead snake that was just lying outside the ashram of that Shamika Rishi, garlanded the sage who was sitting in the meditation room with that dead snake, and walked away from that place. As he was going away, Pariksit reflected on what he did. Then he began to consider, maybe the sage was actually in trance. He was not externally conscious. So, how could he have received me properly? How could he have even noticed me entering his ashram? And why did I insult the sage in that way? He doesn't deserve to be insulted in that way at all. So, reflecting on his action, Pariksit began to feel very, very repentant for having insulted that great sage. And he began to think, may the sage's wrath or anger burn me and my entire kingdom to ashes immediately now. I deserve the worst kind of punishment

That news of the king garlanding the Shamika Rishi with a dead snake reached the boy, Sringi, who was the son of Shamika Rishi, playing outside with his friends. Shamika Rishi's son, Sringi, when he heard this, he became very angry against that king. And he said, how dare the king insult my father, who is a Brahmana, who is a Tapasvi. So, let me teach this king a lesson. Eight-year-old boy, who was actually very powerful, because he was trained by his father in Brahmanical practices. So, he decided, I'm going to curse this king to die. Instantly, he decided. He took some water and purified himself and uttered a curse: May that king, who insulted my father, die within the next seven days by a snake bite.

by a snake bite. And the father, when he came out of trance, first thing he noticed, the dead snake round his neck. He just took that dead snake and threw it away. And he looked at his son and said, my dear son, why are you crying, what happened? Then the boy narrated whatever happened. And then the sage said, my dear son, for a very, very small mistake, you have wrongly punished the king who is the protector of all saintly persons. He himself is a Mahabhagavata. You shouldn't have cursed him to die. It is completely wrong on your part to have given a severe punishment for a minor mistake. It's not proportionate. So anyway, the sage, Shamika Rishi, sent word to Pariksit that Pariksit has been cursed by this immature, a foolish boy misusing his Brahmanical power. And Shamika Rishi begged forgiveness from the Supreme Lord to excuse this foolish boy and also sent word to Pariksit that Pariksit has been cursed and Pariksit may take appropriate steps to counteract this curse.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the story by describing Parikshit Maharaj's acceptance of the curse, his renunciation, and his preparation for death on the banks of the Ganga.

Now Pariksit, when he received the news, he thought that Pariksit was a fool. He thought that I deserve to die by this thing, right? So thinking, Pariksit, even though he could have counteracted the curse, he actually renounced his kingdom, handed over charge to his son to rule the kingdom, and went away to a sacred spot on the bank of the river Ganga and sat there and began to pray. And he began to fast the next seven days and began to inquire from the saintly persons, how should I prepare for quitting my body when I'm going to be bitten by a snake bird due to a curse? So the saintly persons tried to advise him in different ways, but none of them were able to assure him of achieving perfection in the next seven days by practicing whatever they were recommending. Till Sukhadeva Goswami arrived in that assembly, he was not able to do anything. He was unable to do anything, not even for one day. And he was experiencing a state that was stylized, and he experienced a state that was so strong, and he is allied, and he is going to die soon. And he was going to die long ago. He was going to die soon. But, he was in that state for a long time. So in a way, he was able to express himself that he was a saint, and he was part of the village. He was able to go to the village and have food, and he was able to read the sun. He was able to learn the language, and he was able to pray. And he was able to perform those rituals. So he was able to attain the divine wisdom, he went back to Godhead, quit his body and went back to Godhead. So that's the description in the

So Srila Prabhupada explains this is the foretelling about what will happen when he is cursed to die within seven days. He will renounce all material attachments and he will go to the sacred place on the bank of the river Ganga, and he will inquire about proper self-knowledge from the son of Vyasa Deva, from Shukadeva Goswami, Vyasa Sutta, and he will achieve a life of fearlessness. So what is that life of fearlessness? Prabhupada explains in the purport: Material knowledge means ignorance of the knowledge of one's own self. The self is spirit, spirit soul, spiritual nature, same nature as the Supreme Lord, not this material body or material nature, not material, not matter, but spiritual reality won't be there.

you will also become an interior body full of spiritual types, not material, released which plays aší dot accumulations of the leadership powers to create a spiritual nature. The message now in the opposite of matter, so Srila Prabhupada says philosophy means to seek after the right knowledge of one's own self or the knowledge of self-realization. We are born into ignorance, so in ignorance we do not know who we are. We think I am this body, or we may think I am this mind, but we are neither the body nor the mind. We are not even at the intelligence, but we are spirit soul. So this correct understanding of our real self as spirit soul is called self-realization. So Srila Prabhupada says about self-realization, without self-realization, philosophy is dry speculation or a waste of time and energy. There are many philosophers in this world and they have the ability to think about what is the absolute truth, what is this world, who am I, or what is the ultimate reality. They can think about it, but if they don't take proper guidance from a self-realized soul, from an enlightened person, then they simply speculate and waste time and energy. So Srimad Bhagavatam gives the right knowledge of one's own self. Bhagavatam gives the right gift.

So we are meant to prepare ourselves by becoming free from all material attachment and thereby keeping the goal of life as entering into the kingdom of fearlessness, the kingdom of God.

**Key Quote:** "This material world has been discovered as a prison house."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the material world as a prison house filled with fear and anxiety, even for those who try to follow the laws of nature.

its prisoners are always fearful as within a prison house. This material world has been discovered as a prison house in the- just like in a prison house no one can violate the jail rules and regulations, and if they do violate, that means another term for extension of prison life. Similarly, in this material existence, we are always fearful. Somebody may say, I'm not afraid of death, I'm not afraid of anything, I'm a bold person, courageous person. Somebody may say that, but as soon as there is some danger to his life, immediately he starts becoming fearful. Till there is no danger or there's no apparent difficulty or problem, people may speak so many things, but they stop speaking all this rubbish when there is actual danger for their life. Actually, the fearfulness in this material world is called anxiety. Everyone in material life, in all species and varieties of life, is full of anxiety, full of anxiety. You either by breaking or without breaking the laws of nature. Some people they break the laws of nature because they are sinful, and some people are avoiding sin, so they adhere to the laws as far as possible, but both the categories of people have got one common desire for sense gratification, material enjoyment. So such people anyway are always in anxiety.

**Key Quote:** "Liberation or mukti means getting relief from these constant anxieties."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that liberation means freedom from anxiety, which arises from false identification with the material body.

So therefore, Srila Prabhupada says liberation or mukti means getting relief from these constant anxieties. These anxiety is described in the Bhagavatam: Sada Samudvigna Dhyam A-sat-grahat. Life in the material world means Sada, always Samudvigna Dhyam, always being in peace, all your entire race, all the various events are connected to you and your starting point are connected to God which means you are conscious of the two dispfta and zodiac so that is the 뭐라사 자기 사 progressed av bins 싶은 첫 superfic sinister어 Life in the material world means Sada, always Samudvigna Dieam meritorious relations is there between you and your opponent any based on your limits of knowledge and passion always bewildered in one's own mind, always filled with anxiety because Asad Grahat have accepted something false as real. It's like we accept this body as the self, but this body is not the self. This body is simply an external covering of the real self. So therefore, as long as we are not enlightened about our real self, we will always be in anxiety with false understanding of our actual self as this material body.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that relief from anxiety is possible through devotional service and enlightenment about one's real self, emphasizing the unique guidance of Shukadeva Goswami.

And this material body is always subject to disease, old age, death, misery, suffering. So always in anxiety, always in anxiety. So how is it possible to get relief from all anxieties? That is possible only when the anxiety is changed to devotional service of the Supreme Lord. We should not simply try to counteract anxiety by some material methods, which we generally do. No, that's not going to be successful. We should turn to devotional service of Krishna. Only way to become completely free from all anxieties. So Srila Prabhupada says, Srimad Bhagavatam gives us the chance to change the quality of anxiety from matter to spirit, to become the true self. So this is possible only when we are not enlightened about our real self. How is this done? This is done in the association of a learned philosopher like the self realized Shukadeva Goswami, the great son of Sri Vyasadeva. Shukadeva Goswami instructed Parikshit Maharaj, what should Parikshit actually do to prepare for death and achieve perfection, going back to Godhead after quitting the body. Other saintly persons could not give this assurance to the entire world. What is the difference to Parikshit?

That means all other methods, other than the methods suggested by Shukadeva Goswami, are not effective in helping us to prepare for death in such a way that at the end of this life, we can go back to Godhead. So Shukadeva Goswami recommended to Parikshit Maharaj that you become Krishna conscious by hearing about Krishna, by hearing about Krishna's activities, Krishna's names, Krishna's forms, Krishna's pastimes, Krishna's devotees, Krishna's paraphernalia, Krishna's creation. Everything in connection with Krishna. Krishna Katha. You hear Krishna Katha. Absorb your mind in Krishna Katha and become completely transcendental to everything material. And in that way, if you are situated at the time of death, then you straight go back to Godhead.

And that's exactly what Parikshit did. So Srila Prabhupada says, Maharaj Parikshit, after receiving warning of his death, took advantage of this opportunity by association with Shukadeva Goswami and achieved the desired result. This is Parikshit Maharaj's good fortune that he was very anxious when he was sitting for, preparing for death. He was very anxious to somehow hear about Krishna, think about Krishna, talk about Krishna, engage in devotional service to Krishna. And when he got the association of Shukadeva Goswami, he took full advantage of hearing about Krishna and getting to know about Krishna properly, and thereby becoming attached to Krishna, automatically detached from everything material.

**Summary:** The speaker warns against imitating the seven-day Bhagavatam recitation and emphasizes the importance of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam daily for the rest of one's life to prepare for death and return to Godhead.

after quitting the present body. Srila Prabhupada warns that because Shukadeva Goswami spoke for seven days the stream of Bhagavatam to Parikshit Maharaj, other people are imitating Shukadeva Goswami by speaking Bhagavatam for only one week. They call it Bhagavata Saptaha. But this Saptaha is not at all effective. We can clearly see. So, for us to be successful in preparing ourselves to go back to Godhead, we should not only hear seven days but we should hear every day for rest of the life, the Srimad Bhagavatam. That is the recommendation of Bhagavatam: Nityam Bhagavata Sevaya. And in that way we can prepare ourselves to go back to Godhead. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "We cannot be completely free from all suffering in material existence, simply by performing pious activities, materially pious activities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the four fundamental miseries (janma, mrutyu, jara, vyadhi) and three kinds of other miseries (adhi daivika, adhyatmika, adhibhautika klesha) inherent in material existence, emphasizing that pious activities alone cannot eliminate suffering.

implicated because of which we can lead a happy, healthy, prosperous life in this world. While that is partially correct, it is not the complete truth. Under the influence of illusion, we don't take note of the fact that there are four fundamental miseries and three kinds of fundamental other miseries which are imposed upon everyone in the whole material creation, beginning from Brahma down to the most insignificant creature. Brahma, situated in the highest mode of goodness, even he is a father of all good things, and he is afraid of death. Even he is in anxiety. Even he ran, as Paula terrorized the whole universe. So nobody is freed from fear, anxiety, sadhassa mudbhikta GnadiBS asad grahat. You accept material existence via this material body and you're forced to suffer four fundamental miseries, janma, mrutyu, jara, vyadhi, dukkha, dosha, anu, darshanam. I mentioned this several times in the past, and also the three impositions of material nature, adhi daivika klesha, adhyatmika klesha, adhibhautika klesha. Everyone suffers this throughout the universe.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of spiritual knowledge from the Vedas, particularly the Bhagavad Gita, in understanding oneself as a spirit soul and achieving eternal bliss through Krishna consciousness.

So, we cannot be completely free from all suffering in material existence simply by performing pious activities, materially pious activities. So, that is particularly highlighted in the spiritual knowledge given in this book, in the Vedas. While people are engrossed in the material knowledge, either given by modern books of knowledge, or given by the Vedas, they forget the ultimate reality of material existence, which in essence is simply suffering. All those who have born, have to die. In the Bhagavad Gita, second chapter, Krishna says, of one who has taken birth in this material world, it is certain that such person will have to die. And the example is in the Bhagavatam, here are Nikashipa who wanted to be immortal in that very body that he had taken birth, and Brahma said, no, you cannot be immortal in this body, nobody can be immortal, even Brahma cannot be immortal in the same body in which he has taken birth, even he has to leave his body. Therefore, the Vedas instruct us, especially Bhagavad Gita, which gives the essence of the Vedic wisdom, the spiritual wisdom in the Vedas, that you are spirit soul, and as spirit soul, you are entitled to spiritual bliss, eternal life of spiritual bliss and spiritual knowledge, Satchidananda, state of existence, and that is possible by realizing yourself as spiritual by nature, same quality as Krishna, the Supreme.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is the opportunity to get free from all material miseries, it is properly guided by the knowledge of the Vedas in the matters of both material needs and spiritual salvation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vedic knowledge guides individuals towards both material needs and spiritual salvation, emphasizing that merely becoming free from material bondage without realizing one's spiritual self is imperfect because the soul is always active.

And such realization is perfected by Krishna consciousness, by bhakti yoga, not by any other method. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, the knowledge of the Vedas ultimately aims at perfection of self-realization. In other words, Srila Prabhupada says, the Vedas are the guides for the civilized man in every respect, since human life is the opportunity to get free from all material miseries, it is properly guided by the knowledge of the Vedas in the matters of both material needs and spiritual salvation. Material needs and spiritual salvation. Material necessities are there of the body, but that is very easy, taken care of by following the Vedic directions and most importantly if we follow the Vedas then we can also achieve spiritual salvation, spiritual liberation. There is a material conception of liberation where one merely thinks that let me become free from all material problems or material miseries or material bondage, but merely becoming free from all material bondage without realizing one's own spiritual self is imperfect, why? Because as spirit soul we are, we are always active. We are always active. We cannot be inactive. We cannot be without activity, a spirit soul. So those who become free from

It is one of the most important aspects that life libretto lives are Graveос in mining and efflores advisory services a month prior to their mark from material bondage by any process other than bhakti, but do not realize their spiritual self, they actually do not sustain their state of freedom from material bondage because they do not know about the activities after becoming free from material bondage. If they are not engaged in pure devotional service to Krishna, so pure devotional service to Krishna is not only freedom from material bondage but also engagement in the spiritual state of existence, active service to Krishna, spiritual state of existence. So therefore we need not only to fulfill the demands of this body, the material needs, but also work for attaining the spiritual state of existence beyond this material existence.

**Key Quote:** "By birth everybody is ignorant."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the intelligent class of men devoted to the Vedas, called vipras, and explains that everyone is born ignorant, even in a brahmana family, requiring purification through samskaras.

And that is possible only by bhakti, bhakti yoga. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, the specific intelligent class of men who were devoted particularly to the knowledge of the vedas were called the vipras or the graduates of the vedic knowledge. There are four stages of this development in terms of the brahmanical culture. What do the scriptures say? Janmana jayate shudra, by birth everybody is ignorant. Shudra here means one is born ignorant. Please explain in the Bhagavad-Gita also, icha dvesha samuthena dvandva mohena bharata sarva bhutani sammoham sargayanti parantapa. Everyone is born into ignorance in this material world, even if one takes birth in a brahmana family with good parents, very nice cultured family, very nice, one may have a very nice upbringing, but it is necessary to actually undergo samskara, purification, cultural purification, even after taking birth in a brahmana family. And that's what exactly Yudhishthira Maharaj is doing. He is doing this samskara called jatakarma for the child Parikshet which is performed by qualified brahmanas and the vedas further say, janmana jayate shudra samskara vijam ucyate.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of a second birth through cultural purification (samskaras), highlighting jatakarma and upanayana (sacred thread ceremony) as essential for spiritual progress.

One gets a second birth. The first birth is by the parents, the mother and father who conceive a child. The second birth is by cultural purification, samskara. There are ten kinds of samskara, dashavida samskara and jatakarma is one of them. So samskara vijam ucyate, the particular samskara which actually gives one the status of being twice born, second birth is called upanayana, the sacred thread ceremony. So this samskara is required for advancement or progress on the spiritual path in the human form of life. So I'll stop here, we'll discuss more in the

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about Maharaj Pariksit and Sukadev Goswami, emphasizing the mutual benefit of hearing and chanting.

In this session we will be discussing from the third verse of the twelfth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter describes birth of Emperor Pariksit. Tad idam srotum ichchamo gaditum yadimanyase bruhina shraddadhananam yasyagyanam adachukaha The meaning of this verse is, "We all respectfully want to hear about him, that is Maharaj Pariksit, to whom Sukadev Goswami imparted transcendental knowledge, please speak on this matter." So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains Sukadev Goswami imparted transcendental knowledge to Maharaj Pariksit during the remaining seven days of his life, and Maharaj Pariksit heard him properly just like an ardent student. The effect of such a bona fide hearing and chanting of Srimad Bhagavatam was equally shared by both the hearer and the chanter.

**Summary:** The lecture expands on the nine processes of devotional service (Navavidha Bhakti), highlighting how Pariksit Maharaj and Sukadev Goswami achieved perfection through hearing and chanting.

Both of them were benefited. Elsewhere it is explained that there are nine different ways of executing devotional service, Navavidha Bhakti, and nine different personalities, they attained perfection of self-realization simply by adopting one of the nine ways of doing self-realization. And in that description it is said Pariksit Maharaj attained perfection simply by hearing properly the Srimad Bhagavatam as was spoken to him by Sukadev Goswami. Then it is said Sukadev Goswami attained perfection of self-realization simply by speaking Srimad Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj and all the assembled saintly persons. So the benefit of speaking Bhagavatam was shared by the hearer and the chanter. Hearer was Pariksit, chanter was Sukadev Goswami. So Srila Prabhupada says both of them were benefited.

**Key Quote:** "Transcendental realization is attained by such serious hearing and chanting and not otherwise."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts genuine devotional service with bogus methods of spiritual realization, particularly criticizing the idea of transferring spiritual power through touch.

Pariksit Maharaj as well as Sukadev Goswami. Out of the nine different transcendental means of devotional service to the Lord prescribed in the Bhagavatam: Shravanam, Kirtanam, Vishnu, Asmaranam, Padusevanam, Archanam, Vandanam, Dasyam, Sukhyam, Atmanivedanam, either all of them, or some of them, or even one of them, were benefited. equally beneficial if properly discharged. Maharaj Pariksit and Shukadev Goswami were serious performers of the first two items namely the process of chanting and the process of hearing and therefore both of them were successful in their laudable attempt. Srila Prabhupada is now going to tell a very very important point for all of us to note regarding devotional service. Transcendental realization is attained by such serious hearing and chanting and not otherwise. There is a type of spiritual visualization that has made perfect sense to all of us and to wish master and disciple much advertised in this age of Kali. It is said that the master injects spiritual force into the disciple by an electric current generated by the master and the disciple begins to feel the shock. He becomes unconscious and the master weeps for his exhausting his store of so-called spiritual assets. Such bogus advertisement

is going on in this age and the poor common man is becoming the victim of such advertisement. So, Srila Prabhupada is talking about the bogus methods adopted by some bogus spiritualists or spiritual masters or spiritual learners. Both are bogus because nowhere in the scriptures you can find any description that the master is touching the disciple, the spiritual master is touching the disciple and some spiritual force is injected. All this is bogus. This is rubbish, nonsense. There is no such thing in the entire Vedic literature. And further you see the description here of this bogus people that some by the touch some electrical current is generated and the disciple feels some kind of shock. And suddenly the disciple becomes unconscious because of the shock. And this bogus spiritual master, he begins to cry. Oh, by touching you, my spiritual asset is completely become nil. I have lost all the knowledge that I had. This kind of advertisement is going on and it's being glorified. This is a great enlightenment of the disciple by the touch of the master.

**Key Quote:** "No such thing is there."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that authentic Vedic literature focuses on hearing and speaking, not on physical touch or miraculous experiences, reiterating the warning against false practices.

This is totally bogus. Nowhere in the entire Vedic, authentic Vedic literature you find that somebody is touching and then he becomes bereft of all his transcendental knowledge and the disciple is enlightened and the disciple is enlightened. The disciple feels shock. All these bogus things are never there in any authentic scriptures. On the other hand, we find in every Upanishad, in every Purana, we find they are sitting and hearing, asking intelligent questions and the spiritual master is speaking coherently, very, very specifically answering questions. The spiritual master is answering the question to the point without any of this kind of touching and shock and unconscious experience. None of these bogus things are there in the scriptures. So Srila Prabhupada is warning us, please don't become victim of such false propaganda. These are all for... Innocent, ignorant, poor people who do not know what is spiritual life and they are somehow attracted by some advertisement and they are cheated, completely cheated. Nothing is going to happen by somebody touching that some touch will make somebody enlightened. No such thing. No such thing. No such thing is there.

**Key Quote:** "If touch were to work, why there has to be so much of knowledge?"
**Summary:** The speaker questions the need for extensive scriptures and commentaries if enlightenment could be achieved through touch, highlighting the importance of knowledge and the role of acharyas.

Why are there so many books? Why is there so much wealth of literature? What is the reason? If touch were to work, why there has to be so much of knowledge? Why Krishna has to speak Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna and through Arjuna to all of us? And that has to be explained. Every single word spoken by Krishna is explained by the... ...atcharyas. Nowhere we find any acharyas touching somebody and making that person enlightened. Nowhere we find like that. Why the acharyas have to write commentaries? Why they have to explain systematically? So please beware of false advertisement by such bogus spiritual masters and bogus disciples, that is Şathrâäm but that is big deal... it's total cheating I don't want to mention the name but you inquire and you will know that this is so much advertised of one so called guru and his disciple and both are worshipped and become very very popular and a big institution is today they're standing in the name of that bogus master and bogus disciple and people are glorifying this business of touching and electric current and enlightenment and unconscious experience they are

**Summary:** The speaker returns to the example of Sukadev Goswami and Maharaj Pariksit, emphasizing that ardent hearing from a bona fide master is the true path to transcendental knowledge.

glorifying this this is total cheating so Srila Prabhupada says we do not find a such folk tales in the dealings of Shukadev Goswami and his great disciple Maharaj Pariksit the sage that Shukadev Goswami recited Srimad Bhagavatam in devotion and the great king heard him properly the king did not feel any shock of electric current from the master nor did he become unconscious while receiving the knowledge from the master No such thing is described anywhere in the entire Bhagavatam one should not therefore become a victim of these unauthorized advertisements made by some bogus representative of Vedic knowledge the sages of Navamishan Ranya were very respectful in hearing about Maharaj Pariksit because of his receiving knowledge from Shukadev Goswami by means of ardent hearing very respect abiding viewers following Mr. Shreed Mector's teachings. respectfully, very attentively, very seriously, very nicely, Parikshit Maharaj sat down firmly and heard every single word spoken by Sukhadev Goswami. Ardent hearing from the bona fide master is the only way to receive transcendental knowledge and there is no need for medical performances or occult mysticism for miraculous effects.

None of these things are described anywhere in the scriptures. The process is simple but only the sincere party can achieve the desired result which means that as practitioners of Bhakti Yoga, each one of us, we have to properly hear from Srila Prabhupada or those who are speaking on behalf of Prabhupada, as a representative of Prabhupada, those who are speaking, exactly what Prabhupada has spoken or what he has taught and reasonably explaining to the hearers, to the inquisitive learners, very systematically, patiently, clearly explaining the subject matter. And the hearers also ask questions to clear doubts, to enrich themselves in the knowledge. That's why we have exclusive question and answer session where devotees, who are hearing, are asking questions to clarify certain points. We don't have any such bogus touching and enlightenment and electric current. Neither any bona fide spiritual master will ever do that. Please remember this.

In this session, we will be discussing three verses, verses 31, 32, and 33 of the twelfth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The thirty-first verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: as the moon in its waxing fortnight develops day after day, so the royal prince Pariksit very soon developed luxuriantly under the care and full facilities of his guardian grandfathers. So, after the foretelling of the brahmanas, the child was raised. Pariksit was raised very nicely by the grandfathers, the five Pandava brothers, the Pandavas, headed by Yudhishthira. The only surviving descendant was this Pariksit. So, therefore, this Pariksit was raised very nicely and he had good care and attention of all the grandfathers, all the five grandfathers.

**Key Quote:** "So, in order to become free from that guilt, he heard instructions of Bhishma Deva."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Yudhishthira's desire to perform the Ashwamedha sacrifice to atone for the deaths in the Kurukshetra war, and his lack of funds.

The thirty-second verse: Yatsyama. Yatsyama no ashwamedhena nyati droha jihasaya raja labdh dhano dadyau nan yatra karadandayoh. The meaning of this verse is: just at this time, King Yudhishthira was considering performing a horse sacrifice to get freed from sins incurred from fighting with kinsmen, but he became anxious to get some wealth for there were no surplus funds, funds outside of fines and tax collection. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, as the brahmanas and viparas had a right to be subsidized by the state, the state executive head had the right to collect taxes and fines from the citizens. After the battle of Kurukshetra, the state treasury was exhausted and therefore there was no surplus fund except the fund from tax collections and fines. Such funds were sufficient only for the state budget and having no excess fund, the king was anxious to get more wealth in some other way in order to perform the horse sacrifice. Maharaja Yudhishthira wanted to perform the sacrifice under the instruction of Bhishma Deva. So, the history is that after the battle of Kurukshetra, Yudhishthira was thinking that he was responsible for the massacre of such a huge number of Kshatriyas who died in the battle. So, he felt very guilty. Just for me to become the emperor, so many had to be killed. So, in order to become free from that guilt, he heard instructions of Bhishma Deva. And Bhishma Deva instructed him that you are not at all at fault because it is the dharma yudha, and even if you feel that you want to, you have become sinful somehow, you can become free from those residual sins if any, by simply performing this aswam idaiyajna. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj wanted to perform this because Bhishma Deva instructed and he had no surplus funds outside of what he considered the–

**Summary:** The speaker describes how Yudhishthira's brothers, guided by Krishna, went to collect wealth for the sacrifice, emphasizing that sacrifices are meant to please Lord Vishnu.

Whatever taxes he was collecting and fines he was imposing on the citizens and that was just enough for running the state, day to day state administration. So how will he get extra wealth? That is described in the next verse. The 33rd verse, tad abhipretam alaksya, brātaro achyuta choditāha, dhanam prahīnam ājahror, udīcchyām diṣi bhūriṣaḥ. The meaning of this 33rd verse is, understanding the hearty wishes of the king, his brothers, as advised by the infallible Lord Krishna, collected sufficient riches from the north left by king. So Yudhishthira sent his brothers, four brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, to search for wealth and collect that extra wealth and bring it to Yudhishthira so that Yudhishthira can perform this Ashwamedha yajña. Such sacrifices are performed and by kings only because it requires huge arrangements, huge amount of wealth and that is only possible to be organized or arranged by a king. And the emperor, when he performs at the scale of befitting his position as emperor of the whole world, so then he has to organize in a very big way. So for Yudhishthira to organize in a big way the Ashwamedha yajña, his four brothers went to collect riches from the north. Now they were advised by the Supreme Lord Krishna as to where they can find the wealth. Krishna is of course the Supreme Lord, who is all-knowing. But still Krishna wanted to encourage Yudhishthira to perform that sacrifice. And ultimately sacrifices are meant for pleasing Lord Vishnu. So Yudhishthira went to Yudhishthira and told him, Yajñārthāt karmaṇo anyatra lokayam karma-bandhanah tadartham karma kaunteya mukta-saṅga-samācarāt. So tadartham, the sacrifice ultimately is meant for pleasing Lord Vishnu, the act of sacrifice. So Yudhishthira Maharaj wanted to perform this sacrifice and he required wealth for arranging it. And the four brothers whom he sent for fetching wealth, they were guided by Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "He was so powerful an emperor that at the end of the day's end of sacrifice, the demigods from the other planets like Indra, Chandra and Brihaspati used to visit his palace."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Maruta Maharaj, a wealthy and powerful emperor who performed grand sacrifices and was visited by demigods.

So Prabhupāda describes the history of this Maruta Maharaj, who was a predecessor king of Yudhishthira. So Mahārāja Maruta, one of the great emperors of the world, Yudhishthira Maharaj was an emperor, so many millions of years before, Maruta Maharaj was the emperor of the world. He reigned over the world before the reign of Mahārāja Yudhishthira. He was the son of Mahārāja Avikṣit and was a great devotee of the son of the sun god known as Yamarāja. So this Mahārāja Maruta was the devotee of Yamarāja. His brother Sambhartha was a rival priest of the great Brihaspati, the learned priest of the demigods. He conducted one sacrifice called Shankara Yagna by which the Lord was so satisfied that he was pleased to hand over to him the charge of a mountain peak of gold. This peak of gold is somewhere in the Himalaya mountains and modern adventurers may try to find it there. It is there in the Himalayas, this peak of gold. He was so powerful an emperor that at the end of the day's end of sacrifice, the demigods from the other planets like Indra, Chandra and Brihaspati used to visit his palace. And the demigods generally don't come to the earth. But in exceptional cases where the emperor is a very powerful emperor or very qualified emperor or very pious Rajarishi, they visit the earth and become guests of such great emperors or great personalities on this earth. And because he had the gold peak at his disposal, he had sufficient gold in his possession, the canopy of the sacrificial altar was completely made of gold. In his daily performances of the sacrificial ceremonies, some of the inhabitants of the Vayu loka, airy planets, were invited to expedite the cooking work of the ceremony. So these kings were so powerful that they were sumptuously feeding and giving gifts to all the Brahmanas who would help them to perform the sacrifice. And they would invite even the devatas to be their guests. And in order to expedite the cooking work, because so many people would assemble, they had to prepare food for all of them, they would expedite the cooking work by taking help of the inhabitants of Vayu loka, the wind god, their assistants.

They would help in spiritual work. And the assembly of the demigods in the ceremony was led by Vishwadeva. Different categories of demigods were different powers. But it is prestigious that a king is able to get on the earth, is able to get as his guests and get assistance from demigods from the higher planets, who are expert in performing sacrifices, who are expert in making arrangements. Those people helped this Maruth Maharaj was able to perform very nice sacrifices. By his constant pious work, he was able to drive out all kinds of diseases from the jurisdiction of his kingdom. All the inhabitants of higher planets like Deva loka and Pitra loka were pleased with him for his great sacrificial ceremonies. Every day he used to give in charity to the learned brahmanas such things as bedding, seats, conveyances and sufficient quantities of gold, because he had a whole peak of gold at his disposal. Because of munificent charities and performance of innumerable sacrifices, the king of heaven Indra Deva was fully satisfied with him and always wished for his welfare. Due to his pious activities, he was able to take care of thousands of men throughout his life and reigned over the world for one thousand years, surrounded by satisfied subjects, ministers, legitimate wife, sons and brothers. Even Lord Shri Krishna praised his spirit of pious activities. He handed over his only daughter to Maharishi Angira and by his good blessings he was elevated to the kingdom of heaven. He was blessed with a great wealth of wealth. First of all, he wanted to offer the priesthood of his sacrifices to learn his prahaspati. But the demigod refused to accept the post because of the king's being a human being, a man of this earth. He was very sorry for this, but on the advice of Narada, he appointed Sambhartha to the post and he was successful in this mission. Now, Prabhupada explains a very important point. The success of a particular type of sacrifice completely depends on the priest in charge. The priest had to chant proper mantras in a fire sacrifice. Now, if they are not qualified to chant the mantras effectively, the sacrifice will not be successful, the fire sacrifice. Therefore, Prabhupada says that in this age, Kali Yuga, all kinds of sacrifices are forbidden because there is no learned priest amongst the so-called brahmanas who go by the false notion of becoming sons of brahmanas without brahminical qualifications. That's what is happening now. Somebody claims I am a brahmana because he is born in a brahmana family. Whether he has the qualification, whether he is trained up, whether he can chant mantras effectively to perform fire sacrifices, all that is not considered at all. In this age of Kali, therefore, only one kind of sacrifice is recommended, Sankirtan Yajna, as inaugurated by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

#### Yudhishthira's fear, sinful reactions, Ashwamedha sacrifice

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Yudhishthira Maharaj is very, very conscientious. He is not comfortable with his acquired position because it involved a killing, mass killing of so many millions of Kshatriyas soldiers."
**Summary:** This segment explains Yudhishthira's fear and desire to perform the Ashwamedha sacrifice to atone for the sins of the Kurukshetra war.

In this session we will be discussing from the 34th verse of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We will be covering this verse in two parts. So this session will be part 1 of this 34th verse. The verse is as follows: तेन संभृत संभारो धर्मपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरहा वाजिमेधैस् तृभिर्भीतो यज्ञेई समयजद्धरिम्. The meaning of this verse is: By those riches, the king could procure the ingredients for three horse sacrifices. Thus the pious king Yudhishthira, who was very fearful after the battle of Kurukshetra, pleased Lord Hari, the personality of Godhead. So in the previous verse it was described how Yudhishthira Maharaj sent his brothers to fetch wealth for performing this Ashwamedha sacrifice. So they were directed by Krishna to bring some gold, gold which was left behind by the brahmanas who were engaged in sacrifice by a former emperor, Maruth Maharaj. So that gold, Arjuna brought it for Yudhishthira Maharaj to procure ingredients for performing three horse sacrifices. So however good they want to crucify Yudhishthira and take away their wealth through a battle of Kurukshetra, Kanpaksara's desires became as strong as their Councill. So Ripaaprasadana introduced this 2004 shloka here, that Maharaja Yudhishthira was that ideal and celebrated pious king of the world and still he was greatly afraid after the execution of the battle of Kurukshetra, because of the mass killing in the fight, all of which was done only to install him on the throne. Yudhishthira Maharaj is very, very conscientious. He is not comfortable with his acquired position because it involved a killing, mass killing of so many millions of Kshatriyas soldiers. So he was very, very much afraid of the sinful reactions incurred due to such a massacre. He therefore took all the responsibility for sins committed in the warfare and to get rid of all these sins, he wanted to perform three sacrifices in which horses are offered at the altar.

**Key Quote:** "Sometimes the wealth is considered an impediment in spiritual progress."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the contrast between Vedic times, where people were satisfied with basic needs and focused on spiritual goals, and modern civilization, which is driven by sense gratification and material pursuits, also mentioning how wealth should be used.

Ashwamedha Yagna or Vajimedha Yagna. Such a sacrifice is very costly. Even Maharaj Yudhishthira had to collect the necessary heaps of gold left by Maharaj Marutta and the brahmanas who were given gold in charity by King Marutta. The learned brahmanas could not take away all the loads of gold, and therefore they left behind a major portion of the gift. And Maharaj Marutta also did not again collect such heaps of gold given away in charity. Once it is given in charity, it should not be taken back. Besides that, all the golden plates and utensils which are used in the sacrifice were also thrown in the dustbins and all such heaps of gold remained unclaimed property for a long time till Maharaj Yudhishthira collected them for his own purposes. You see how people were, Prabhupada will explain that, people were satisfied with the basic needs because they had a higher goal in life. The modern civilization, people are just having some immediate goal of living their life for satisfaction of the senses. But in the former times, as directed by the Vedic scriptures, people had the spiritual aim of life. And for attaining that ultimate spiritual goal of life, you don't require to have lot of wealth. Sometimes the wealth is considered an impediment in spiritual progress. Sometimes. Of course, all wealth should be utilized for yajna, for Vishnu, for the supreme personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "The defect of the modern civilization is that people simply know one thing in life, sense gratification."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Yudhishthira utilized the unclaimed gold for sacrifice and contrasts the contentment of people in the past with the modern focus on industrial enterprise and sense gratification, leading to material bondage.

And that's what we will see Yudhishthira Maharaj utilizing this gold which was collected by Arjuna. It was Yudhishthira Maharaj who utilized all that gold for performing three hard sacrifices. Lord Sri Krishna advised the brothers of Maharaj Yudhishthira to collect the unclaimed property because it belonged to the king. This is the understanding, when the king is ruling a certain tract of land, then that tract of land belongs to the king. The king will also utilize it properly for the welfare of the state, the citizens. So Srila Prabhupada explains here, the more astonishing thing is that no subject of the state also collected such unclaimed gold for industrial enterprise or anything like that. Nowadays people are so busy mining for the sake of developing industry. But formerly, even if there was unclaimed gold left behind somewhere, nobody would go and touch that. How is that people were not attracted to go and fetch or take away such gold? Because they know that something that does not belong to me, if I take it, I am going to incur reactions, sinful reactions, for stealing, for taking away something that is not lawfully mine, something not properly earned by me, I cannot take that. This means that the state citizens were completely satisfied with all necessities of life and therefore not inclined to accept unnecessary productive enterprises for sense gratification. The defect of the modern civilization is that people simply know one thing in life, sense gratification, and their entire life is simply meant for such sense gratification, which is implicating them in material bondage.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of taking lessons from Yudhishthira's example, highlighting his fear of sins and his desire to satisfy the Supreme Lord through sacrifice, even for unintentional actions.

Aspirants must know the truth, precwrights should know the truth, that is, respect, caring, love, respect. One should take lessons from the acts of Maharaj Yudhishthira. He was afraid of sins committed on the battlefield, and therefore he wanted to satisfy the supreme authority. Maharaj Yudhishthira is a very, very pious king. He is son of Dharmaraja, Yamaraja, and he is perfectly aware of all the laws of karma. So in spite of being pious, in spite of being very conscientious, still he was afraid of sins committed on the battlefield, unintentionally, unknowingly. Unknowingly he will never do it. Intentionally he will never have an intention of killing anybody unnecessarily, never. But unknowingly, accidentally, unintentionally something might have happened in a battle. So he is afraid of that. This indicates that unintentional sins are also committed in our daily occupational discharges. And to counteract even such unintentional crimes, one must perform sacrifices as they are recommended in the revealed scriptures. So Shastra says, if you have committed some sin unintentionally, unknowingly, still you have to perform recommended sacrifices.

**Verse References:** BG 3.9
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Therefore, the main purpose of performing sacrifices is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari."
**Summary:** This segment explains the importance of performing sacrifices as recommended in the scriptures to counteract sinful reactions and satisfy the Supreme Lord, leading to peace and prosperity.

The Lord says in Bhagavad Gita, yajñārthāt karmano anyatra loko yam karma-bandhanah. In the third chapter, ninth verse, Krishna says this, that one must perform sacrifices recommended in the scriptures in order to get rid of commitments of all unauthorized work or even unintentional crimes which we are apt to commit. Therefore, if one performs the recommended sacrifices, then they are freed from sinful reactions. And those who do not do so, those who do not perform sacrifices, but work for self-interest or sense gratification, such people have to undergo all tribulations accrued from committed sins. The laws of nature are very subtle and they are working perfectly and there is an enforcing authority, material nature itself being directed by the Supreme Lord Krishna. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ śūyateśaccharācaram. So, intelligent people understand that any person suffering in this world is only because that person has committed sinful activities for which he is suffering the reactions in the form of miseries, troubles and dangers, diseases and all kinds of, any kind of suffering. Therefore, the main purpose of performing sacrifices is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari. The process of performing sacrifices may be different in terms of different times, places and persons. Kāla, Deśa and Pātra. These are Sanskrit words: Time, place and person. But the aim of such sacrifices is one and the same at all times and in all circumstances, namely, satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Hari. Only one aim of performing sacrifices as given in the scriptures, simply to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari. That is the way of pious life and that is the way of peace and prosperity in the world at large. So, by performing sacrifice for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord Hari, we not only are engaged in pious activity but we are also able to attain peace and prosperity by such performance sacrifices.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Then we can just imagine the amount of sins committed consciously or unconsciously by the untrained population of the Kali Yuga who have no way to perform sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difficulty of avoiding sin in Kali Yuga, especially compared to the time of Yudhishthira, and the lack of means for the general population to perform sacrifices to atone for sins.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session, we will continue discussion of the 34th verse, which we began in the previous session, of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The verse I will just recite once again just to refresh your memory: Tenasamrita Sambharo Dharmaputro Yudhishthiraha Vajimedai Stribirbhito Yajnai Samayajad Harim. The meaning of this verse is: by those riches, the king could procure the ingredients for three horse sacrifices; thus, the pious king Yudhishthira, who was very fearful after the battle of Kurukshetra, pleased Lord Hari, the personality of Godhead. So continuing the purport, if Maharaj Yudhishthira is a sinner in his daily discharge of duties in royal administration of state affairs, wherein the killing of man and animals is a recognized art, then we can just imagine the amount of sins committed consciously or unconsciously by the untrained population of the Kali Yuga, who have no way to perform sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord. So those days when people were very careful when they would indulge in killing, whereas nowadays people are not trained, and the influence of Kali is such that they become indifferent to the sins they may commit. They are not worried about it, but they have to suffer. Suffering cannot be avoided simply by being ignorant or claiming that I don't know that I will be punished by doing something wrong.

**Key Quote:** "सम्सिद्धि, सम्सिद्धि means the highest perfection, is simply possible by pleasing the Lord Hari."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the prime duty is to satisfy the Lord through occupational duty and recommended sacrifices, especially chanting the holy name of Krishna in Kali Yuga, which leads to freedom from sins and the highest perfection.

Srila Prabhupada specifically says here, in Kali Yuga people do not have a way of becoming free from the sinful reactions. Srila Prabhupada says therefore that the prime duty of the human being is to satisfy the Supreme Lord by the performance of one's occupational duty under varnashrama dharma. स्वानुष्ठितस्य धर्मस्य संसिद्धिर् हरितोषणम्. संसिद्धि, संसिद्धि means the highest perfection, is simply possible by pleasing the Lord Hari. So, should I proper further explain? Let any man of any place or community, caste or creed be engaged in any sort of occupational duty, but he must agree to perform sacrifices as it is recommended in the scriptures for the particular place, time, and person. So the occupational duty per se does not matter so much, but rather the people should perform recommended sacrifices and thereby become free from all reactions. In the Vedic literatures, it is recommended that in Kali Yuga or present age, people engage in glorifying the Lord by chanting the holy name of Krishna. In the Bhagavatam, in different places it is said that people should engage in glorifying the Lord by chanting his holy name. In the twelfth canto also it is told, kirtanadeva krishnasya muktasanga param vrajet. So people have to actually perform the sacrifice of chanting the holy name of Krishna. That is what people have to do. By doing so, one can be free from all sins and thus can attain the highest perfection of life by returning home back to Godhead. People think of the highest perfection of life is to attain liberation, but that liberation is not possible if one does not engage in devotional service. So therefore, by devotional service one can be free from all sins and can also attain the highest perfection simultaneously by practising bhakti regularly.

#### Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Sankirtan Yagna, sacrifice, Kali Yuga

**Key Quote:** "Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has taught us simply perform this Sankirtan Yagna and get the highest benefit."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teaching of Sankirtan Yagna as the most beneficial sacrifice in Kali Yuga, as it is simple and effective.

Especially in the introductory portion, by sketching the life of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, in the beginning of this Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada has given a biography of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and it is observed that in Kali Yuga people are generally not inclined to perform sacrifice due to different reasons, but Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has taught us simply perform this Sankirtan Yagna and get the highest benefit. The Lord has declared openly in Bhagavad Gita how he becomes pleased with us, and the same process is practically demonstrated in the life and preaching work of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Bhagavad Gita Krishna clearly says if you perform sacrifice for the sake of my pleasure, that is the proper way. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu practically demonstrated in this life and also preaching that anyone can actually chant Hare Krishna and perfect their life. It is possible for anyone. The perfect process of performing Yagna or sacrifice to please the Supreme Lord Hari is to follow the ways of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in this dark age of quarrel and dissension. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has taught a specific method of performing Yagna and that is called Sankirtanam, congregational chanting of the holy name. That is the way especially in this Yuga, Kali Yuga.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Just suitable for the age is the method recommended by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in terms of the Shastra."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the difficulty of performing traditional Yagnas requiring vast resources with the simplicity and effectiveness of chanting Hare Krishna as taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, which requires no expenditure.

Maharaj Yudhishthira had to collect heaps of gold to secure the paraphernalia for the horse sacrifice Yagnas in days of sufficiency. Those days people had lot of natural resources and all their desires easily fulfilled by the Supreme Lord, they are all pious. But in other cases, somebody may not be able to offer sacrifices to the Supreme Lord, sacrifices to the Supreme Lord the way Yudhishthira Maharaj performed. That is not possible. So people of this age can hardly think of such performance of Yagnas in these days of insufficiency and complete scarcity of gold. Where will they get gold from, so much of gold that Yudhishthira Maharaj spent? So it is not practically possible. It is not practically possible. And Prabhupada makes a remark about the modern system of economy. At the present moment, we have heaps of papers and promises of their being converted into gold by economic development of modern civilization, and still there is no possibility of spending riches like Maharaj Yudhishthira either individually or collectively or by state patronization. State never promotes and finances such Yagnas, but even people cannot spend the kind of money individually or collectively which Yudhishthira Maharaj spent. So Srila Prabhupada says just suitable for the age is the method recommended by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in terms of the Shastra. Now what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is recommending is not his own recommendation, though it is Supreme Lord disguised as a devotee, but he is not recommending anything which is not in the scriptures. Such a method requires no expenditure at all. What is the expenditure in chanting Hare Krishna and yet can award more benefit than other expensive methods?

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So therefore, it is recommended to chant the holy name of Supreme Lord Hari and easy, inexpensive, effective way of doing sacrifice in this age."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that animal sacrifices in Vedic times were different from modern slaughter, as the animals were rejuvenated by Vedic mantras chanted by qualified brahmanas, which is not possible today, making chanting the best sacrifice.

Somebody takes up ashtanga, sorry, the method of meditation, the method of cultivating knowledge, etc., then we cannot get more benefit in this way than what is obtained by chanting Hare Krishna in the association of devotees. The horse sacrifice Yagna or cow sacrifice Yagna performed by the Vedic regulations should not be misunderstood as a process of killing animals. Sometimes meat eaters they say that you tell us not to eat meat, but then formerly even the pious people used to perform animal sacrifices. So isn't it very difficult to eat meat? People they always took sin as soul to kill animals and eat their flesh when plenty of fruits, vegetables, and all vegetarian food stuff is available. So therefore, the proper... Now, Prabhupada says, animals offered for the yajna were rejuvenated to a new span of life by the transcendental power of chanting the Vedic hymns, the brahmanas who chant the mantras. And by the power of the mantra, the animal which was sacrificed or killed in a horse sacrifice, that animal would be revived when the priest in the sacrifice would actually chant mantras, suitable mantras. So therefore, the misunderstanding that formerly they were killing animals for the sake of performing sacrifice, now they are killing animals for the sake of feeding the slaughterhouse, but that is not the real proper understanding. The Veda mantras are all practical and the proof is rejuvenation of the sacrificed animal. So when an animal is killed for a sacrifice, then the animal is revived. But reviving such an animal requires the power of the mantra to be chanted by duly qualified brahmanas. And Srila Prabhupada says, there is no possibility of such methodical chanting of the Vedic hymns by the so-called brahmanas who preach of the present age. So therefore, it is recommended to chant the holy name of Supreme Lord Hari, an easy, inexpensive, effective way of doing sacrifice in this age.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains Srila Prabhupada's commentary on the importance of qualified brahmanas for performing sacrifices, emphasizing that birth alone is insufficient.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udeerayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 35th and the 36th Lokas, the verses of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavata. Ahuto Bhagavan Ragna Yajayitva Dvijayan Dripam Uvasa Katichin Masan Surudam Priyakam Yaya. The meaning of this verse is: Lord Shri Krishna, the personality of Godhead, being invited to the sacrifices by Maharaj Yudhishtira, who does behind him the noble positions of a highly ranked brahmana. Later He retrospectively says that their roles in the업bapar to receive suffering will be defined by això act as well. Lord Krishna Dvinam have the Dvija who is the demon arbitre. Sirila Prabhupāda explains powerfully that Lord Krishna is the only greedy person among the people of this route. Peti, Rajas, Sahara, and holdalword are called truestadt? caused the performance of yajnas by learned twice born brahmanas.

**Key Quote:** "Such brahma bandhus or unqualified once born skyans must be rejected for any purpose of religious responsibility"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the necessity of proper training and initiation for brahmanas, stating that unqualified brahmanas are equated with shudras and should not be entrusted with religious duties, highlighting Krishna's role in ensuring qualified individuals performed sacrifices.

Further, Shri la Prabhupada says, simply taking birth in the family of a brahmana does not make one qualified to perform yajnas. One must be twice born by proper training and initiation from the bona fide acharya. Here is a very important point: it is not enough to merely take birth in a certain family; it is very important to acquire the qualification by proper training and initiation from the proper acharya. The once-born's kinds of brahmana families are equal with the once-borns born shudras. So, the first birth is by the parents, and in this regard, whether one takes birth in a brahman family or a shudra family, it does not matter; both by birth are not qualified, and such unqualified brahmanas are actually equated with shudras. This may sound very harsh, but this is the reality. And Srila Prabhupada says further, such brahma bandhus or unqualified once born skyans must be rejected for any purpose of religious responsibility, and such unqualified brahmanas are actually equated with shudras or vedic function. If somebody is not qualified, such a person cannot be engaged for performing some yajna or some religious ritual. It's not possible. Lord Shri Krishna was entrusted to look after this arrangement, and perfect as he is, he caused the yajnas to be performed by the bona fide twice-born brahmanas for successful execution. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took help of Krishna, and Krishna ensured that Yudhishthira Maharaj's sacrifices were actually properly performed under the guidance of qualified brahmanas. The next verse, the 36th verse.

**Key Quote:** "In Kali Yuga, only the Sankirtan Yagna is recommended."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of qualified priests for Vedic sacrifices and notes their rarity in the current age (Kali Yuga), recommending the chanting of the holy name as the primary yagna.

So, we have to understand the importance of engaging qualified brahmanas to perform a Vedic sacrifice. So, elsewhere Srila Prabhupada explains, to perform a sacrifice successfully, at least four expert priests are required. Who are the four expert priests who should be present for successfully executing a sacrifice? One who can offer, is called Hota. One who can chant, Utgata. One who can kindle the sacrificial fire without the aid of separate fire, Advaryu. And one who can supervise, Brahma. So, Hota, Utgata, Advaryu, Brahma. Four kinds of priests are required for performing a Vedic sacrifice. Such sacrifices were conducted from the birth of Brahma, the first living creature, and were carried on till the reign of Maharaja Yudhishthira. But, such expert brahmana priests are very rare in this age of corruption in India. And therefore, in the present age, only the Yagna of chanting the holy name of the Lord is recommended. The scriptures enjoin, Hare Nama Hare Nama Hare Namaiva Kevalam Kalau Nastyeva Nastyeva Nastyeva Gathiranyatha.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates a story about Krishna and Balarama sending covered boys to ask brahmanas performing a Vedic sacrifice for food, illustrating the boys' respectful approach and their explanation of their needs.

So, in Kali Yuga, only the Sankirtan Yagna is recommended. And to chant the Hare Krishna Mantra does not require previous qualification. Another place, Prabhupada says that once Krishna had gone with some covered boys. Krishna and Balarama had gone with some covered boys early morning, taking the calves for grazing. And the boys, after some time, became very, very hungry. So, they told Krishna, please arrange for some foodstuff. Krishna then told the boys that nearby this place, wherever they were, there are some brahmanas who are performing a Vedic sacrifice. So, Krishna told the boys, go to those brahmanas and ask for some charity, some dana. Then those covered boys went to those brahmanas and approached them with folded hands and fell down to the ground to offer them respect. So, what did the covered boys say? They addressed the brahmanas and they said, O earthly gods, kindly hear us, who are ordered by Lord Krishna and Lord Balarama. We hope you know them both very well, and we wish you all good fortune. Krishna and Balarama are tending cows nearby, and we have accompanied them. We have come to ask for some food from you. You are all brahmanas. You are knowers of religious principles. And if you think that you should give us charity, then give us some food, and we shall all eat along with Krishna and Balarama. The boys continued to speak to those brahmanas. You are the most respectable brahmanas within the human society, and you are expected to know all the principles of religious procedure. So, this is what the boys said to those brahmanas.

**Key Quote:** "If you associate with Krishna or his pure devotee, then automatically you are able to get enlightenment simply by performing devotional service"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that association with Krishna or his devotees leads to enlightenment and understanding of religious principles, emphasizing that the brahmanas should have immediately offered food to Krishna and Balarama.

Now, Srila Prabhupada explains, although the boys were village boys and were not expected to be learned in the Vedic principles of religion, they hinted that because of their association with Krishna and Balarama, they knew all those principles. If you associate with Krishna or his pure devotee, then automatically you are able to get enlightenment simply by performing devotional service in understanding all the religious principles, especially those which are meant to enliven us, enlighten us, without separate endeavour at studying or doing some other practice. Simply by association with the right people, you become enlightened, you become enlivened. Now, these boys, covered boys, because they were associating with Krishna and Balarama, they expressed the point of view that when the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna and Balarama were asking for food, the brahmana should immediately deliver some without hesitation, and they should actually perform yajna only for the satisfaction of Vishnu.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story, explaining the boys' understanding of when food can be accepted and highlighting the brahmanas' mistake in ignoring the request, thus missing an opportunity for devotional service.

Now, the boys continued to speak to the brahmanas. They said, Lord Vishnu, as Krishna and Balarama is standing waiting, and you should immediately deliver whatever food you have in your stock. So, the Vedic culture is no food is refrigerated, but the food may be kept, fresh food may be kept, to actually feed some guests or feed some extra people like that. Now, these covered boys, they also explained to those brahmanas that when food is to be accepted, and when food is not supposed to be accepted. The Vaishnavas generally don't perform ordinary sacrificial ceremonies, but still the devotees know very well about all the ceremonial rituals in connection with offering to Krishna. So, they began to speak to the brahmanas that we can take your food at the present stage of your ceremony. For now, it will not be prohibited. So, you can deliver us the food. We'll take it to Krishna and Balarama. Although the companions of Krishna and Balarama were so very simple in their habits, still, they were in a position to dictate to high-class brahmanas engaged in Vedic rituals of sacrifice. That is because of their association with these with Krishna and Balarama. Simply because of associating Krishna and Balarama they were able to dictate even to the high-class brahmanas. But the brahmanas being very very fruity-minded, they ignored this request of these covered boys, and the boys went back disappointed. So, the brahmanas lost that opportunity for rendering pure devotion service to Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that Krishna accepts offerings made with devotion, either directly or through a devotee, and reiterates that the brahmanas missed the central point by ignoring the boys' request, ending with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

And therefore, we should be careful in understanding that Krishna accepts either directly from the devotee or through the medium of another devotee provided it is offered with devotion. But these covered boys they were misunderstood and Krishna Krishna sorry the brahmanas who have performed sacrifice missed the central point and ignored these boys' request. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "There is a need for the science of Krishna in human society for all the suffering humanity of the world."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of discussion, verse 4 of the 12th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, and emphasizes the importance of the science of Krishna for the well-being of humanity, referencing Srila Prabhupada's vision.

In this session, we will be discussing from the fourth verse of the twelfth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Suta Uvacha Apipalad Dharma Rajaha Pitruvad Rajayan Prajaha Nispraha Sarvakamebhya Krishna Padanu Sevaya. The meaning of this verse is: Shri Suta Goswami said, "Emperor Yudhishthira administered generously to everyone during his reign. He was exactly like his father. He had no personal ambition and was freed from all sorts of sense gratification because of his continuous service unto the lotus feet of the Lord Shri Krishna." So Suta Goswami is beginning to answer the point raised by Shaunaka Rishi on behalf of the sages of Naimishaharanya. Srila Prabhupada explains this elaborately in the purport. As many of you know, in our introduction, there is a need for the science of Krishna in human society for all the suffering humanity of the world. And we simply request the leading personalities of all nations to take to the science of Krishna for their own good, for the good of society, and for the good of all the people of the world. This is the vision of the Acharya.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada as the Acharya is thinking about the well-being of every living entity in this entire world."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's concern for all living beings and how Acharyas, particularly Srila Prabhupada, share this concern and advocate for the science of Krishna to benefit the world, especially if leaders participate.

Srila Prabhupada's vision is meant for doing good to the entire world. Acharyas come to this world on behalf of Krishna. Krishna's concern is every living entity in this material world who is suffering. Krishna's concern is all such suffering souls. Krishna wants to deliver, wants to take back all the suffering souls who are suffering in this material world to his personal abode. So just like Krishna thinks of the entire world, every living being, similarly the Acharyas, and in our present times, Srila Prabhupada as the Acharya is thinking about the well-being of every living entity in this entire world. Therefore, he is suggesting, based on the Srimad Bhagavatam's recommendation, that everyone should simply take to the science of Krishna. That will do them good. And if leaders simply participate in this attempt to distribute this science of Krishna to the entire world, then it will do good to the whole world, to the entire campus, to everyone.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The king represents all living beings."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the examples of Maharaj Yudhishthira and Ramachandra as ideal kings and explains the meaning of the word 'Praja' to encompass all living beings, not just humans.

So it is confirmed herein by the example of Maharaj Yudhishtira. Ramachandra was the ideal king, and all other kings or emperors in India controlled the destiny of the world for the prosperity of every living being who took birth on the earth. You see, Ramaraja is important because Lord Ramachandra ruled in such a way that there was prosperity for every living being. And Srila Prabhupada now particularly explains the word Praja. Herein, the word Praja is significant. The etymological import of the word is that which is born, Praja, that which is born. On the earth, there are many species of life from aquatics up to the perfect human beings, and all are known as Prajas. Praja doesn't mean only human beings. Praja means all living beings who take birth in this world. Lord Brahma, the creator of this particular universe, is known as the Prajapati because he is the grandfather of all who have taken birth. Thus, Praja is used in a broader sense than it is now used. The king represents all living beings: the aquatics, the plants, trees, reptiles, birds, animals, and man.

**Key Quote:** "Every one of them is a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita to emphasize that all living beings are part of the Supreme Lord and that a true leader should provide protection to all, contrasting this with the current demoralized system of administration.

Every one of them is a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. And this is mentioned in Bhagavad Gita, 14th chapter, 4th verse: Sarva Yoni Shukanteya Am Bija Pradapita. Krishna says, "Of all species of life, I am... I am the seed-giving father." So, every living being is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The king, being the representative of the Supreme Lord, is duty-bound to give proper protection to every one of them. This is not the case with the presidents and dictators of this demoralized system of administration in the present times. The same then Telugu The rent which has been laid at times happened in the late mud days to the gametea, however the man fewer, better persons where the lower animals are given no protection, while the higher animals are given so-called protection. It's the animal society The man more important such that simply neglectful of the spiritual culture and they live like animals and the government is not really bothered about the real welfare of the people neither they give proper protection to the poor animals the lower animals so Srila Prabhupada says this is a great science how to give protection to all

By knowing the science of Krishna, one can become the most perfect man in the world. And unless one is knowledgeable in the science, all qualifications and doctorate diplomas acquired by academic education are spoiled and useless. Nowadays, people claim to have done so much advancement in different branches of science and technology, but they don't have any knowledge about the science of Krishna, and therefore all their other knowledge is useless. It results in defeat of human birth, defeat of the entire civilization. Maharaj Yudhishthira knew this science of Krishna very well, for it is stated here, and by continuous cultivation of this science or by continuous cultivation of devotional service to Lord Krishna, he acquired the qualification of administering this state.

**Key Quote:** "He wants to free all the people from the shackles of material suffering."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service is not sectarian and is meant for every human being, highlighting Maharaj Yudhishthira's desire to free people from material suffering and his administration based on the good of the citizens.

So this is the necessity for the king or the governmental head to actually continuously cultivate this devotional service to the Supreme Lord Krishna. This is not a sectarian process meant for some believers. No, it is meant for especially every human being. The father is sometimes seemingly cruel to the son, but that does not mean that the father has lost the qualification to be a father. A father is always a father because he always has the good of the son at the heart. The father wants every one of his sons to become a better man than himself. Therefore, a king like Maharaj Yudhishthira, who was the personality of goodness, wanted everyone under his administration, especially human beings who have better developed consciousness, to become devotees of Lord Krishna so that everyone can become free from the trifles of material existence. See the lofty thinking of Maharaj Yudhishthira. He wants to free all the people from the shackles of material suffering. He wants to make them completely free from material suffering. And for that, there is a definite process recommended in the Srimad Bhagavatam. His motto of administration was all good for the citizens, for as personified goodness, he knew perfectly well what is actually good for them. He conducted the administration on that principle

**Key Quote:** "Modern day administrators they rule the world based on giving sense gratification to the people and that is demoniac."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the demoniac principle of sense gratification with the ideal of serving Krishna, explaining that serving Krishna includes serving all living beings as parts and parcels of the whole.

and not on the Rakshasi demoniac principle of sense gratification. Modern day administrators, they rule the world based on giving sense gratification to the people, and that is demoniac. It makes people degraded. It makes people selfish. It makes people cruel. It makes people envious. So that is not the proper way to rule the world or the nation or the kingdom. As an ideal king, he had no personal ambition: Nisriha Sarvakamyaipya. Personally, he had no desire for material enjoyment, and there was no place for sense gratification because all his senses at all times were engaged in the loving service of the Supreme Lord, which includes the partial service to the living beings who form the parts and parcels of the complete whole. So when Yudhishthira Maharaj is serving the Supreme Lord Krishna, that means he is also engaged in serving the living beings who are part of Krishna. Those who are busy rendering service to the parts and parcels, leaving aside the whole, only spoil time and energy as one does when watering the leaves of a tree without watering the root.

**Key Quote:** "When one renders service to Krishna who is the complete whole, then all the parts and parcels, the living entities, they are automatically served."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of watering the root of a tree to explain that serving Krishna automatically serves all living beings, emphasizing that Yudhishthira Maharaj's administration ensured both comfort in this life and progress in the next, concluding the lecture with thanks and Hare Krishna.

This is the example given in the Bhagavatam. As when watering the root of a very big tree, all the branches, the leaves, the twigs, every other part of the tree is completely nourished by the watering of the root of the tree. Exactly like that. When one renders service to Krishna who is the complete whole, then all the parts and parcels, the living entities, they are automatically served by this one action of serving Krishna. If water is poured on the root of the tree, the leaves are enlivened perfectly and automatically. But if water is poured on the leaves only, the whole energy is spoiled. Maharaj Yudhishthira therefore was constantly engaged in the service of the Lord, and thus the parts and parcels of the Lord, the living beings, under his careful administration, were perfectly attended with all comforts in this life and all progress in the next. That is the way of perfect management of state administration. See, not only this life, when Yudhishthira Maharaj was doing administration, their next life was also safeguarded. It was the best preparation for the people for the next life by rendering service to Lord in this life. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on King Yudhishthira's perfect rule and how his good administration was so exceptional that it garnered attention even in the heavenly planets, where they usually don't pay attention to earthly affairs.

So this is the wonderful description about King Yudhishthira Suta Goswami is describing. So Srila Prabhupada elaborates in the purport: Only a rich and great man's name and fame are known as the name of the great man all over the world, and the name and fame of Maharaj Yudhishthira who reached the higher planets because of his good administration, worldly possessions, glorious wife Draupadi, the strength of his brothers Bhima and Arjuna, and his solid sovereign power over the world known as Jambudvipa. You see, Yudhishthira was so perfectly ruling. He was the emperor of the entire earth planet, and he was so perfectly ruling in accordance with the instructions given by Krishna and confirmed by the saintly advisors in his kingdom. So he was ruling perfectly, and therefore his administration became very famous, that news reached the heavenly planets. We should always remember in the heavenly planets, they don't really bother much about what's happening on earth except when such an excellent devotee is ruling the entire earth planet perfectly. Except in such cases, the heavenly residents do not bother about what's happening on the earth.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the significance of the word 'loka' and emphasizes that life exists on every planet in the universe, contrary to the modern scientific view, and that Vedic literature provides accurate descriptions of these higher planets.

So, here the word lokāha is a significant word that is used in this fifth verse: Sampadaha kratavo lokāha. Why this word is significant? Śrīla Prabhupāda says there are different lokas or higher planets scattered all over the sky, both material and spiritual. The inhabitants of this earth planet, especially the scientists and some philosophers, in the modern days they tend to think there is life only on the earth planet, and this is completely wrong. There is life on each and every planet in this universe. Every planet there is life. And there are millions and billions of planets, and the living conditions on the planets are variegated. There are much better planets in terms of the facilities provided to the residents of those planets, as described in the scriptures called Svarga loka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Satyaloka, Cetaloka. To each planet there are lives. So, whatever are the problems, they are not for everyone. For the one who lives and lives, every planet lives. And there are millions and billions of planets. And the Satyaloka, these are unknown to the so-called scientists and modern-day educated class of people, they do not know about this, but there is complete, very accurate and perfect description of these lokas in the Vedic literature.

**Key Quote:** "Those who worship Krishna they are eligible to be transferred to Krishna's planet."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the different destinations one can attain after death based on their worship, referencing Bhagavad Gita 9.25, and clarifies that one cannot forcefully enter the higher planets without following natural laws and qualifying oneself.

A person can reach them, that is the higher planets, by dint of his work in the present life as stated in Bhagavad Gita 9.25. What is the verse? yanti deva vrata devan pitrin yanti pitr vrataha bhutani yanti bhute jya yanti madhyajino pimam. Four different destinations are described for four different classes of people in this world. What is that? Those who worship demigods, they reach the planet of the demigods in their next life. Those who worship the pitris, the ancestors, they go to the planet of the ancestors in their next life. Those who worship ghosts and spirits, they attain the above the ghosts and spirits, and those who worship Krishna, they are eligible to be transferred to Krishna's planet, the top most planet, the spiritual planet. So this is the way worship according to the recommendation in the Shastra. So Srila Prabhupada clarifies here further, just like Srila Prabhupada says, the tiny material scientists and engineers who have discovered vehicles to travel over a few thousand miles in outer space will not be allowed entrance into the higher planets. Will not be allowed entrance. Why? Because they are all governed by natural laws. If we don't follow those laws, we cannot enter any of those upper planets. That is not the way to reach the better planets. They have some sputnik, they have some space vehicle and they think by simply travelling they are going to forcefully enter. No, never possible.

**Key Quote:** "One must qualify himself to enter into such happy planets by sacrifice and service."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of sacrifice (Yajna) and service (Seva) to qualify for entering the higher planets, highlighting that these planets are free from sinful activities.

One must qualify himself to enter into such happy planets by sacrifice and service. Yajna and Seva, Bhakti Seva. Yajna means authorised sacrifice given in the scriptures. Those who are sinful in every step of life can expect only to be degraded animal life, to suffer more and more the pangs of life, material existence. And this is also stated in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 16th chapter 19th verse. It is stated there in the 16th chapter 19th, word of the Bhagavad Gita, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by me into the ocean of material existence into various demoniac species of life. So demons degrade themselves. They cannot forcefully enter the upper planets. That's not possible. Maharaj Yudhishthira's good sacrifices and qualifications were so lofty and virtuous that even the residents of the higher celestial planets were already prepared to receive him as one of them. So the residents of the higher planets are all pious beings and they are engaged in sacrifice. They are engaged in seva, in service. They are free from sinful activities. Sin is unknown in the upper planets.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the sinful activities on Earth, particularly animal killing, with the purity of the higher planets, emphasizing that one cannot reach those planets through mere technological advancement but through scriptural recommendations.

On the other hand, we see on the earth so many people committing sin by killing animals just for the sake of satisfying their tongue to eat some flesh, animal flesh. So this is not at all proper for such people to think that they can travel by some spacecraft to the higher planets where the standard of living is thousands and millions of times better than the best standard of living on the earth. So the method is sacrifice, service, worship, as recommended in the shastra, not concocted worship, not concocted yajna, but as recommended in the shastra.

**Key Quote:** "It's not going to work."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that King Yudhishthira's proper execution of duties led to earthly abundance and reiterates that forceful entrance into higher planets through space travel is not possible, as it's driven by sense gratification.

So the scriptures are giving perfect knowledge about this process. Yanti deva vrata deva. Now Maharaj Yudhishtira, he was carrying out his duties as given in the shastra. But the result of Yudhishtira Maharaj doing his duties properly is that he was able to cultivate the earth in such a way that the earth was providing everything in plenty. That was described in the earlier chapter. So this is possible not because of forceful entrance into the upper planets by means of some space vehicle or some kind of spacecraft. It's not going to work. As Prabhupada says, they may go some few thousand miles into outer space, but they cannot land anywhere. That's why they are always coming back. If they really were to go to upper planets where standard of living is millions of times better, why will they come back to this earth planet which is filled with misery? Why will they come back to this situation? It's because they are not going anywhere into outer space. Neither they are actually able to land in any particular place, suitable place. They are simply engaged in

**Summary:** The speaker condemns cow killing as the greatest sin, describing the severe punishment awaiting those who commit it, and offers Krishna consciousness as a means of relief from sinful reactions.

sense gratification, giving trouble to lower animals and committing so many sinful activities, especially killing the cow. It's the worst kind of sin, the greatest sin. What do the shastras say about cow killing? The killers of the cow, they will be punished in hell for as many years as there are hair on the body of the cow. Can you count the body of the cow having how many hair? Impossible. So that is the fate that is awaiting all these sinful people. Their future is very, very bleak. Of course, if they take to Krishna consciousness, then they can be relieved of all the sinful reactions. That's possible if they take to Krishna consciousness, not otherwise.

**Key Quote:** "even such opulences cannot bewilder a pure devotee, because the pure devotee's mind is fully absorbed in devotional service to Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains that a pure devotee, absorbed in Krishna's service, remains unaffected by material opulence, even those that enchant heavenly beings.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Kimte Kama Suras Parha Mukunda Manasodvijaha Adhijakhrur Mudham Ragnaha Shuditasya Yathetare. The meaning of this verse is, O Brahmanas, the opulence of the king was so enchanting that the denizens of heaven aspired for it. But because he, the king, Yudhishthira, was absorbed in the service of the king, nothing could satisfy him except the Lord's service. So this clearly explains the position of a pure devotee, even though he may be emperor of this world, with opulences which are able to bewilder even the heavenly residents, even such opulences cannot bewilder a pure devotee, because the pure devotee's mind is fully absorbed in devotional service to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Constitutionally means the way we are made. We are meant to simply serve, serve, serve."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the constitutional position of the living being as a servant, contrasting it with the illusion of being the served, and highlighting how people are often servants of their senses.

So Srila Prabhupada explains very nicely in the purport, there are two things in the world which can satisfy living beings, this world. When one is materially engrossed, he is satisfied only by sense gratification. But when one is liberated from the conditions of the material modes, he is satisfied only by rendering loving service for the satisfaction of the Lord. This means that the living being is constitutionally a servitor. The way we are made. Constitutionally means the way we are made. We are meant to simply serve, serve, serve. And we are never the one who is served. Krishna is the only one who is always served by everyone else. Everyone else is a servant, a servitor. Being illusioned by the conditions of the external energy, material energy, illusory energy, maya, one falsely thinks himself to be the served, but actually he is not served. He is servant of the senses like lust, desire, anger, avarice, pride, madness, and intolerance. Even people who are very, very powerful, very rich, very nicely educated, very influential, but ultimately they are all servant of their senses. When it comes to them becoming victim of lust, desire, anger, pride, madness, intolerance, they cannot control themselves. When one is in his proper senses by attainment of spiritual knowledge, he realizes that he is not the master of the material world, but is only a servant of the senses.

**Key Quote:** "Happiness in the service of Krishna is real happiness."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the realization of one's position as a servant through spiritual knowledge, leading to happiness through devotional service to Krishna, contrasting it with illusory material happiness.

To realize this requires spiritual understanding. At that time, that is when one comes to understand his position as a servant, as a saint. He begs for the service of the Lord, and thus becomes happy, without being illusioned by so called material happiness. Material happiness is not real happiness. Happiness in the service of Krishna is real happiness. Maharaj Yudhishthira was one of the liberated souls. How is that? Because, pure devotee and therefore for him there is no pleasure in a vast kingdom, good wife, obedient brothers, happy subjects, and prosperous world. None of these things could give him real happiness. These blessings automatically follow for a pure devotee even though the devotee does not aspire for them. That means a devotee may be blessed with a vast kingdom, any material opulences, he does not aspire for them. The example set herein is exactly suitable. What are the example? It is said that one who is hungry is never satisfied by anything other than food. Can hunger be satisfied by anything else other than food? Nourishing, relishable, palatable food is the only thing that can satisfy hunger. Similarly, a devotee's heart is only satisfied by devotional service to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "the whole material world is full of hungry living beings the hunger is not for good food is not for shelter is not for sense gratitude the hunger is for the spiritual atmosphere why because we are spirit soul we are not the body"
**Summary:** This segment explains that the material world is full of living beings hungry for spiritual satisfaction, which is often misrepresented as material hunger for food, shelter, and sense gratification, even among the materially satisfied.

And not by anything else. Now Srila Prabhupada explains a very, very important point that we should carefully note. The whole material world is full of hungry living beings. There is no exception to this reality, fact of life. The whole material world is full of hungry living beings. The hunger is not for good food, is not for shelter, is not for sense gratitude. The hunger is for the spiritual atmosphere. Why? Because we are spirit soul. We are not the body. We are not a material product. Due to ignorance only, they think that the world is dissatisfied because there is not sufficient food. Due to ignorance only people think the world is dissatisfied. The world is dissatisfied because there is no sufficient food or no sufficient shelter, defense, and objects of sense gratification. Ahara, nidra, bhaya, maithu, namcha. These are four demands of the body. Every living entity's body demands these four things. And people think there is some scarcity of one or more of these four things. That's why people are dissatisfied. But that's not the real fact. This is called illusion. To think that people are dissatisfied because of the scarcity of one of these four things, ahara, nidra, bhaya, maithu, namcha, is actually due to illusion. When the living being is hungry for spiritual satisfaction, he is misrepresented by material hunger. But the foolish leaders cannot see that even the people who are most sumptuously, materially satisfied are still hungry.

**Key Quote:** "This hunger is actually for spiritual food, for spiritual shelter, for spiritual defense, and spiritual sense gratification."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the concept of spiritual hunger, explaining that the true need is for spiritual food, shelter, defense, and sense gratification, which can be found in association with Krishna.

Even the people in rich nations, in rich households, in very powerful, influential, opulent positions, even they are hungry. So hunger is not for any of those four material needs. And what is their hunger and poverty? This Prabhupada explains. This hunger is actually for spiritual food, for spiritual shelter, for spiritual defense, and spiritual sense gratification. There are two things. There is something called material hunger, material food, material shelter, material defense, material sense gratification. This we all know. We have experience of this. But there is something else we do not know. What is that? Spiritual food, spiritual shelter, spiritual defense, spiritual sense gratification. This is something we have to learn from the Bhagavatam. These can be obtained in the association of the Supreme Spirit, Lord Sri Krishna. And therefore, one who has them cannot be attracted by so-called food, shelter, defense, and sense gratification of the material world, even if such material food, shelter, defense, and sense gratification are relished by the denizens of the heavenly planet. We may see that somebody else in a relatively higher material position may be relishing something, apparently, better than what we have with us in terms of material food or material facilities. But the reality is all living beings in every position in this material world are hungry for spiritual atmosphere, for spiritual food, spiritual shelter, spiritual defense, spiritual sense gratification.

#### liberation, eternity, devotional service

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma, any devata, anybody belonging to this material world cannot give you liberation from material existence."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the limitations of material existence, even in the highest planets like Brahmaloka, and emphasizes that true satisfaction and liberation can only be attained through devotional service to Vishnu/Krishna.

Therefore, in the Bhagavad Gita 8.16, it is said by the Lord that even in the topmost planet of the universe, namely the Brahmaloka, what is the situation in Brahmaloka? In Brahmaloka, the duration of life is multiplied by millions of years by earth calculation. Sahasra yuga pariyantam aharyat brahmano vidhu. That twelve hours of Brahma, Brahma loka, the residence of Brahma loka, where Brahma lives, is equal to one thousand maha yugas of this world. This earth planet. That comes to some four billion years of our calculation. Twelve hours of Brahma, half a day of Brahma, is four billion solar years on the earth. So, in that Brahma loka also, one cannot satisfy his hunger by any material food, material arrangements, no. Such hunger can be satisfied only when the living being is situated in immortality. Asatoma saggamaya. This is one of the statements in the original Vedas. Don't remain in asat, in material existence. Come to spiritual existence. Satgamaya. Eternity. Come to eternity. Come to eternality. This immortality is attained in the spiritual sky, far, far above Brahma loka, in the association of Lord Mukunda. The Lord, who awards his devotees, the transcendental pleasure of liberation. Lord Mukunda. There are so many verses that describe. Mukunda means the giver of liberation. Mukti pradata sarveshaam vishnur eva na samshayah. Lord Shiva says that, Mukti, if you want liberation from this material existence, then that it can be only given by Vishnu or Lord Krishna or Mukunda, one who can give liberation, one who gives liberation, one who factually gives liberation. Even Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma, any devata, anybody belonging to this material world cannot give you liberation from material existence.

**Summary:** This segment concludes by reiterating that liberation is granted only to those engaged in devotional service to the Lord, not through other means.

So this we have to always remember. And, to whom does the Lord give liberation? He gives liberation to those who are engaged in his devotional service. And not to anybody else who may be doing so many other things other than devotional service. They don't get liberation. They are only given relative material facilities. That's all.

#### Brahmastra, Mantra Astra, Rebirth, Womb Experience

**Key Quote:** "After seven months, a child in the womb of a mother comes to external consciousness."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of mantra weapons, the process of rebirth, and the uncomfortable experience of a child within the womb after seven months.

Something extraordinary happened at the time when Pariksit was in his mother's womb and Ashwathama attempted to kill this child by releasing a Brahmastra targeted at this child only. Unlike the modern weapons, the mantras which are used as weapons, mantra, astra, they can be directed towards a very specific target and they will go searching for the target wherever the target may be and destroy the target, attack the target. So that is explained by Prabhupada in the purport. Death generally involves remaining in trance for seven months. A living being, according to his own action, is allowed to enter into the womb of a mother by the vehicle of a father's Samina, semen, and thus he develops his desired body. This is the law of birth in specific bodies according to one's past actions. When he is awake from trance, he feels the inconvenience of being confined within the womb. After seven months, a child in the womb of a mother comes to external consciousness, awakens from something like sleep. When the child enters the womb as a soul, transfer from one body to the next body, a human body, then he enters a human mother's womb. And then for seven months the child is lying, lying as if unconscious, or as if sleeping. But he awakens after the seventh month, and in the seventh month when he awakens, he is like in a mother's womb, in an airtight bag, in a very uncomfortable position, feels the inconvenience of being confined in that airtight bag called the womb of the mother, and also experiences the surroundings are full of all kinds of secretions in the mother's womb, all kinds of urine, pus, mucus, blood, stool, all kinds of obnoxious things, and thus he wants to come out of the mother's womb.

**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes Pariksit's devotion, Krishna's personal intervention to protect him from the Brahmastra, and Pariksit's ability to endure the heat due to his nature as a great fighter.

And sometimes, fortunately, such a soul prays to the Lord for such liberation. I want to get out, please, my dear Lord, help me. Maharaj Pariksit, while in the womb of his mother, was struck by the Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama, and he was feeling the burning heat. But Maharaj Pariksit is no ordinary soul. He is described here because he was a devotee of the Lord. The Lord at once appeared himself within the womb by his all-powerful energy, and the child could see that someone else had come to save him. Pariksit is bold enough to face the Brahmastra, but still, even though he is bold, because he is a devotee, Krishna personally entered the womb of his mother to save the child. Krishna has a personal interest in that devotee, and Pariksit could see someone else has come into the womb, into this place, even at a helpless condition. The child Pariksit endured the unbearable temperature due to his being a great fighter by nature, and for this reason the word Viraha has been used. Pariksit has been described as Matur Garbhagato Viraha. Viraha is a very powerful fighter, brave, bold, able to tolerate the extraordinary heat of the Brahmastra released by Ashwathama.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the form of the Lord as seen by Pariksit in the womb, referencing verses eight and nine, detailing his size, color, dress, and ornaments.

And then he saw Krishna entering the womb of his mother in order to save him. Then in the eighth verse, it is described, Angushta matram amalam, Spurat puratam aulinam, Apivya darshanam shyamam, Tadidvasasam achyutam.

**Key Quote:** "It is said in the Brahma Samhita that the Supreme Lord Govinda by his one plenary portion enters into the hallow of the universe and distributes himself as Paramatma of the Supersoul."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the Lord's all-pervading nature as Paramatma, referencing the Brahma Samhita and explaining how Maha Vishnu enters the universe in seed form and expands.

The meaning of this ninth verse: The Lord was enriched with four hands, Chaturbahum, earrings of molten gold, Kanchana kundalam, and eyes blood red with fury, Chatajaksham, and as he loitered about, his club constantly encircled him like a shooting star. Krishna was carrying the club in his hand, Gadapanim, Bhramayantam, holding his gada, he was just encircling like a shooting star, Ulkabham. Srila Prabhupada says in the purport that it is said in the Brahma Samhita that the Supreme Lord Govinda, by his one plenary portion, enters into the hallow of the universe and distributes himself as Paramatma of the Supersoul, not only within the heart of every living being, but also within every atom of the material elements, Andantarastaparamanuchayantarastam. He enters into the Anda. Anda means the egg, egg-shaped universe, universal shell. This is the beginning of creation, that Lord Maha Vishnu, he lies on the Karna ocean, he breathes out universes. They come in seed-like form, but that seed-like form of the universe, into that, Maha Vishnu expands as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu and enters into it. Vishnu means one who enters. So as Vishnu he enters, first of all the material dormant material energy, and then that material energy develops into universes, seed-like form, into each seed-like form of the universe.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the Lord's presence in every atom and living being, emphasizing his inconceivable energy and connecting it to his ability to enter Uttara's womb to protect Pariksit.

Lord expands and enters the second Vishnu, Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, and it begins to develop. So entering into that universe, it is described, in the universe, he enters, and then it develops, and he also, as the development happens and living entities are produced, the whole material world is created. Every atom of the universe, material atom also, he enters as Paramatma, Antantarasta, Paramanu chayantarastam. Paramanu means the material atoms, the whole universe. Thus the Lord is all-pervading by his inconceivable energy. Who can conceive the Lord in his form as Paramatma has entered the hollow of the universe? He has entered into the heart of every living being, every living being is entered into the inside every material atom. Who can conceive this? It's inconceivable, achintya. And he also entered the womb of mother Uttara to save his beloved devotee Maharaj Parikshit. If he can enter into every material atom, he enters into every universe, he enters into the heart of every living being, why can't he enter the womb of mother

**Key Quote:** "The Lord assured everyone that his devotees are never to be vanquished."
**Summary:** The lecture highlights the Lord's promise to protect his devotees, referencing Bhagavad Gita 9.31, and uses Ravana as an example of someone who couldn't be saved when Krishna desired his demise.

Uttara for the sake of his devotee, to save his devotee from the attack of the Brahmastra? So in the Bhagavad Gita, again Srila Prabhupada is quoting the Bhagavad Gita 9.31, 9th chapter, 31st verse, the Lord assured everyone that his devotees are never to be vanquished, Kaunteya pratijaanihi na me bhakta-pranasyati, my devotee, mad-bhakta na pranasyati, is never vanquished. So no one can kill a devotee of the Lord because he is protected by the Lord, and no one can save a person whom the Lord desires to kill, maare Krishna rakshake ke, rakshake Krishna maare ke. If Krishna wants to protect a devotee, nobody can kill that devotee, and if Krishna wants to kill some Asura or demon or some miscreant, nobody can protect that miscreant. And that's what happened to Ravana. He was a devotee of Shiva, and he is praying to Shiva, kindly protect me when Rama came to attack Ravana, and Shiva said, Rama, the Supreme Personality of God, wants to kill you, who can protect you? Nobody can save you. And if Krishna wants to protect Parikshit Maharaj, no brahmastra, no person, no weapon, nothing can destroy

The Pariksit Maharaj devotee. The Lord is all-powerful, and therefore he can both save and kill as he likes. He became visible to his devotee Maharaj Pariksit, even in that awkward position in the womb of his mother, in a shape just suitable for his vision. Lord gave him darshan. And Srila Prabhupada explains, the Lord can become bigger than thousands of universes, Mahavishnu. He is lying on the causal ocean, and within his body there are millions of universes, and he can become smaller than an atom at the same time and enter into the... Every material atom. Merciful as he is, he becomes just suitable to the vision of the limited living being. He is unlimited. He is not limited by any measurement of our calculation, but he can become bigger than we can think of, and he can become smaller than what we can conceive. But in all circumstances, he is the same all-powerful Supreme Lord. His position, his power does not change. Unlimited power is always with him. So, the Lord mercifully gave darshan to Pariksit and also saved him. That's his mercy upon his pure devotee.

In this session, we will be discussing the first and second verses of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, with this session, we are beginning a new chapter in the first canto, the 13th chapter. The 13th chapter is entitled Vritrashtra Quits Home. And here is the first verse: Suta Vacha Viduras Tirthayatrayam Maitreyad Atmanogatim Nyatvagat Hastinapuram Taya Vapt Vividsitaha. The meaning of this first verse is: Shri Suta Goswami said, "While travelling on a pilgrimage, Vidura received knowledge of the destination of the self from the great sage Maitreya and then returned to Hastinapuram. He became as well versed in the subject as he desired." Who was Vidura? Shrilairati Amarath Shilaprabha explains in the purport. He gives a brief history of the personality of Vidura. In this purport, Shrilaprabha says, "One of the prominent figures in the history of the Mahabharata." He is describing Vidura. Vidura was conceived by Vyasa Deva in the 14th century. He took a sweet, light, and gentle way of living. So, Vidura quitted his old Soyine form. He became the central figure of the Mahabharata. In this way, he is the leader of the Mahabharata. He has been a leader for two centuries. He was a great figure and the most experienced in the Mahabharata of this time around because he was a great person. He was a great warlord. Yasadeva in the womb of the maidservant of Ambika who was the mother of Maharaj Pandu. He is the incarnation of Yamaraj. Being cursed by Mandukamuni, he was to become a Shudra. The story is narrated as follows. Prabhupada's story. How Yamaraj had to take birth after being cursed as Vidura, the son of a maidservant. Once upon a time, the state police caught some thieves who had concealed themselves in the hermitage of Mandukamuni. The police constables, as usual, arrested all the thieves and Mandukamuni along with them. The magistrates specifically punished the Muni to death by being pierced with a lance. When he was just to be pierced, the news reached the king, and he at once stopped the act on consideration of his being a great Muni. The king personally begged the Muni's pardon for the mistake of his men. And the saint, that is Mandukamuni, at once went to Yamaraj who prescribes the destiny of the living beings. Yamaraj being questioned by the Muni. The king replied that the Muni in his childhood pierced an ant with a sharpened straw and for that reason he was put into difficulty. The Muni thought it unwise on the part of Yamaraj that he was punished for his childish innocence. The Muni thought it unwise on the part of Yamaraj that he was punished for his childish innocence. And thus the Muni cursed Yamaraj to become a Shudra. And thus the Muni cursed Yamaraj to become a Shudra. And this Shudra incarnation of Yamaraj was known as Vidura, the Shudra brother of Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Pandu. And this Shudra incarnation of Yamaraj was known as Vidura, the Shudra brother of Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Pandu. But this Sudra son of the Kuru dynasty was equally treated by Bhishma Deva along with his other nephews, and in due course, Vidura was married with a girl who was also born in the womb of a Sudrani by a Brahmana. Although Vidura did not inherit the property of his father, that is the brother of Bhishma Deva, still he was given sufficient state property by Dhritarashtra, the elder brother of Vidura. Vidura was very much attached to his elder brother Dhritarashtra, and all along he tried to guide him on the right path. During the fratricidal war of Kurukshetra, Vidura repeatedly implored his elder brother Dhritarashtra to do justice to the sons of Pandu, but Duryodhana did not like such interference by his uncle Vidura, and he refused to do so. And thus Duryodhana practically insulted Vidura. This resulted in Vidura's leaving home for pilgrimage and taking instructions from Maitreya.

**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of the second verse, focusing on Vidura's attainment of transcendental loving service to Krishna through questioning Maitreya Muni.

This resulted in Vidura's leaving home for pilgrimage and taking instructions from Maitreya. This is the history of Vidura described by Prabhupada. The meaning of this second verse is: after asking various questions and becoming established in the transcendental loving service of Lord Krishna, Vidura retired from putting questions to Maitreya Muni. That means he kept asking questions till he was properly established in transcendental loving service of Krishna, so which means you can understand the goal of all preliminaries in practicing religious principles is basically to come to the point of becoming established in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Vidura retired from putting questions before Maitreya Muni when he was convinced by Maitreya Rishi that the samambonam of life is to be finally situated in the transcendental loving service of Lord Sri Krishna."

**Key Quote:** "Like Vidura an inquisitive conditioned soul must approach a bona fide spiritual master like Maitreya and by intelligent inquiries must try to know everything about karma fructive activities about jnana philosophical research for the supreme truth and about yoga the linking process of spiritual realization."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the futility of seeking happiness through material means and emphasizes the importance of approaching a qualified spiritual master to understand karma, jnana, and yoga.

Who is Govinda? Or one who satisfies his devotees in all respects. The conditioned soul, the living being in material existence, seeks happiness by employing his senses in the modes of materialism, but that cannot give him satisfaction. Under illusion, we think, "I can be happy, satisfied in every respect if I somehow engage in sense gratification." He then searches after the supreme truth by the empiric philosophical speculative method and intellectual feats, but if he does not find the ultimate truth, ultimate goal, he again goes down to material activities and engages himself in various philanthropic and altruistic works which all fail to give him satisfaction. So, neither fruitive activities nor dry philosophical speculation can give one satisfaction because by nature a living being is the eternal servitor of Vishnu, and all the Vedic literatures give him direction towards that ultimate end. The Bhagavad-Gita confirms the statement. Krishna says, "From all the Vedas, I am to be known." Like Vidura, an inquisitive conditioned soul must approach a bona fide spiritual master like Maitreya, and by intelligent inquiries must try to know everything about karma, fruitive activities, about jnana, philosophical research for the supreme truth, and about yoga, the linking process of spiritual realization.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of a genuine spiritual master who can guide disciples to devotional service of Krishna, highlighting that bhakti is the ultimate goal.

One who is not seriously inclined to put questions before a spiritual master need not accommodate a show bottle spiritual master, nor should a person who may be a spiritual master for others pose to be so if he is unable to engage his disciple ultimately in the transcendental loving service of Lord Shri Krishna. So, Prabhupada clearly explains here the goal of all Vedic rituals is ultimately to come to the point of engaging in devotional service of Lord Krishna. So, Vidura was successful in approaching such a spiritual master like Maitreya, and he got the ultimate goal of life. What is that ultimate goal of life? It is bhakti unto Govinda.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, Vidura inquired from Maitreya and Maitreya was competent to answer all of Vidura's questions because Maitreya was one of the sages who heard from Lord Brahma about self-knowledge."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Vidura's pilgrimage as an example of exemplary Krishna conscious behavior and reiterates that the ultimate goal of life is to be situated in loving devotional service to Krishna.

Thus, there was nothing to be known further about spiritual progress. So, Vidura apparently, as will be explained in the later verse, left his palace for the sake of going on a pilgrimage. Now, people go to pilgrimage to get rid of sinful reactions, but since Vidura is a pure devotee, there was no need for him to perform any religious rituals like that, but because he wanted to set an example how one should lead an exemplary life in Krishna consciousness, he retired from transform land finger all palace activities and went on pilgrimage pIyagam. Now, going on pilgrimage is also significant because one will be able to properly realize. Hmm, another example was vik bigam manohar understand this knowledge of the self only by progressing towards pure devotional service. Therefore, Vidura inquired from Maitreya, and Maitreya was competent to answer all of Vidura's questions because Maitreya was one of the sages who heard from Lord Brahma about self-knowledge. So, Vidura kept on inquiring, putting questions from Maitreya till he was convinced by Maitreya that he was a good man. The ultimate goal of life is simply to become situated in transcendental loving service of Krishna. That's the perfection. There is nothing else to be achieved because our constitutional position is eternally to be engaged in loving, devotional service of Krishna. Jeevera Swarupa Nitya Krishna Das. So, when Vidura realized that and was situated properly, he retired from asking any further questions. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verses from Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Yudhishthira's inquiry about the well-being of the Yadavas and their devotion to Krishna.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam In this session we will be discussing from the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth verses of the thirteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter is entitled Dhritarashtra Quits Home. The eleventh verse Apinaha Suhrudastata Bandhava Krishna Devataha Drishta Shrutava Yadavaha Svapuriyam Sukhamasya. This is an inquiry made by Yudhishthira to Vidura. The meaning of this verse is, My uncle you must have visited Dwaraka. In that holy place are our friends and well-wishers, the descendants of Yadu who were always wrapped in the service of the Lord, Sri Krishna. You might have seen them or heard about them, are they all living happily in their abodes so this was the inquiry by Yudhishthira.

#### Krishna consciousness, devotion, favorable vs. unfavorable

**Key Quote:** "The real qualification of a pure devotee is to become wrapped in the thought of Krishna favorably...favorably being absorbed in thought of Krishna is called Krishna consciousness."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of thinking of Krishna favorably, contrasting it with the unfavorable thoughts of demons like Kamsa, and defining favorable absorption as Krishna consciousness.

So in the purport, points out the particular word Krishna Devata, that is those who are always wrapped in the service of Lord Krishna is significant. The Yadavas and the Pandavas were always wrapped in the thought of the Lord Krishna and his different transcendental activities, were all pure devotees of the Lord. Like Vidura, not only Vidura was a pure devotee, even the Yadavas and Pandavas, even while staying in a palace or staying at home, they were always wrapped in the thought of Lord Krishna and his different transcendental activities, and this way they are also counted among pure devotees of the Lord. Vidura left home in order to devote himself completely to the service of the Lord, but the Pandavas and the Yadavas were always wrapped in the thought of Lord Krishna, thus there is no difference in their pure devotional qualities, either remaining at home or leaving home. The real qualification of a pure devotee is to become wrapped in the thought of Krishna favorably. This is very important, to continuously absorb oneself in thinking of Krishna favorably, that is what is the meaning of favorably, becoming absorbed in the thought of Krishna, knowing well that Lord Krishna is the absolute personality of Godhead, not that Krishna is an ordinary person or Krishna is an enemy or Krishna is a, like the example given here by Srila Prabhupada, and other demons like them were also always wrapped in thought of Lord Krishna, but they were absorbed in a different way, namely unfavorably. So favorably being absorbed in thought of Krishna is called Krishna consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "Simply by thinking of Krishna always anyone can get salvation but to revive our dormant devotion to Krishna and to be transferred to his personal abode...is possible only by the divine grace of Lord Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the difference between salvation and attaining Krishna's personal abode through loving devotion and divine grace.

So favorably being absorbed in thought of Krishna is called Krishna consciousness, unfavorably always thinking of Krishna like Kamsa, that is not Krishna consciousness. Now these demons, they were absorbed in thought of Krishna unfavorably or thinking him to be a powerful man only. See demons, they don't recognize Krishna to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They don't want to accept or they think that they can compete with Krishna. This is a very, very big mistake. Therefore Kamsa and Shishupala are not on the same level as pure devotees like Vidura, the Pandavas and the Yadavas. Simply by thinking of Krishna always anyone can get salvation but to revive our dormant devotion to Krishna and to be transferred to his personal abode as his associate and engage in loving service is possible only by the divine grace of Lord Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker provides practical advice on how to cultivate Krishna consciousness, even while living at home, through chanting, reading Srila Prabhupada's books, and associating with devotees.

This is only for those who are absorbed in thinking of Krishna favorably, not unfavorably. Therefore to think of Krishna in Krishna consciousness. It is described in the Bhagavad Gita that always thinking of Krishna in loving devotion, in thought of Krishna in loving devotion, that is actually favorable and that is that immediately qualifies one to actually be transferred to the spiritual world in personal association of Krishna. Maharaja Yudhishthira was also always wrapped in the thought of Lord Krishna and his associates in Dwaraka. Otherwise he could not have asked all about them from Vidura. Maharaja Yudhishthira was therefore on the same level of devotion as Vidura although engaged in the state affairs of the kingdom of the world. This is an instruction for us that we may not be traveling to Holy places, may not be living in a temple but even living at home if we are able to absorb our mind in Krishna consciousness through chanting Hare Krishna as far as possible and gradually progressing to come to the stage of constantly thinking of Krishna in so many different ways. Maharaja Yudhishthira was also always wrapped in the thought of Lord Krishna in so many different ways. The art of constantly thinking of Krishna has to be learnt from Srila Prabhupad by following his instructions by reading his books, by associating with his devotees, by engaging in devotional service, in varieties of ways recommended in the scriptures we can be always thinking of Krishna and become attracted

**Key Quote:** "Compassionate Mahatma Vidura could not stand to see the Pandavas distressed at any time therefore he did not disclose this unpalatable and unbearable incident."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Vidura withheld the news of the Yadu dynasty's annihilation from the Pandavas, citing compassion and the principle of not speaking unpalatable truths.

to Krishna and Krishna consciousness, promote ourselves to the kingdom of Krishna in the spiritual world. At any time we can do that, we can immediately transfer ourselves to the spiritual world. The twelfth verse, the meaning of this verse is thus being questioned by Maharaj Yudhishthira, Mahatma Vidura gradually described everything he had personally experienced except the news of the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty. Vidura told everything except that the Yadu dynasty was completely annihilated, that he did not tell. Why? In the 13th verse that is explained why. So 13th verse, the meaning of this 13th verse says compassionate Mahatma Vidura could not stand to see the Pandavas distressed at any time therefore he did not disclose this unpalatable and unbearable incident because calamities come of their own accord. So in this 13th verse it's explained that Vidura did not disclose this unpalatable and unbearable incident of the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty to the Pandavas. Now Srila Prabhupada says in the purport according to Niti Shastra, civic laws, one should not speak an unpalatable truth to cause distress to others. The Niti Shastra says satyam bhruyat priyam bhruyat na bhruyat satyam apriyam. Apriyam is unpalatable, even though it may be the truth, apriyam satyam, unpalatable truth one should not speak because that will cause distress to others. See how refined is

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a forest fire to illustrate how distress arises naturally and should not be aggravated by spreading unpalatable truths.

Vedic culture, that you must speak the truth but only that which is palatable. Why? Why is it like this? Because distress comes upon us in its own way by the laws of nature. See nobody can prevent natural calamities, they come of their own accord. Just like the example is given of a forest fire, nobody goes to the forest to set fire to the trees but when there is sometimes in blazing summer heat when there is a wind blowing and there is friction between two dry bamboo pieces and there is a spark, that spark can ignite a fire in the dry bamboo in the blazing sun and that fire will spread throughout the forest, a dense forest filled with dry bamboo plants, it can spread very quickly and the fire will even aid the spreading of the fire and a big portion of the forest can be entirely echeloned by this fire to collect out fire wherever they may be, forest can be entirely burnt away by the forest fire and great destruction can happen. Now this is not due to somebody going and setting fire to the dry bamboo, no it happens of its own accord by arrangement of providence therefore it is said here distress comes upon us in its own way

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating Vidura's compassion and his reasons for withholding the news, emphasizing the close relationship between the Pandavas and Yadavas.

by the laws of nature so one should not aggravate it by propaganda. There is no need to speak of unpalatable truths if we want to not cause distress for people who are already distressed by natural calamities. So this is the, so one should not aggravate the distress by propaganda further for a compassionate soul like Vidura especially in his dealings with the beloved Pandavas it was almost impossible to disclose an unpalatable piece of news like the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty. The Pandavas and the Yadavas they were very closely related both by family ties and because both were devotees of pure devotees of Krishna so they always discussed about Krishna in absorbed in thought of Krishna as you said in the previous verse. So therefore Vidura did not disclose this news of the annihilation Yadu dynasty purposely refrained from it and except that he told everything else about his travels to the Pandavas. I'll stop here thank you very much.

#### Vidura's visit, Purpose of saintly persons, Material absorption

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He stayed there just to rectify the mentality of his eldest brother Dhritarashtra."
**Summary:** This segment explains the purpose of Vidura's visit to the palace of Yudhishthira, which was to rectify Dhritarashtra's mentality, and the general significance of visits from saintly persons to the homes of householders.

In this session we will be discussing from the 14th verse of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. कंचित कालम अथावात सीत सत्कृतो देववत सुखम भ्रातुर जेष्ठस्य श्रेयस्कृत सर्वेशाम सुखम आवहन. The meaning of this verse is thus: Mahatma Vidura, being treated just like a godly person by his kinsmen, remained there for a certain period just to rectify his kinsmen, to rectify the mentality of his eldest brother, and in this way bring happiness to all the others. So this being said of the purpose of Vidura's visit to the palace of Yudhishthira, the Pandavas, after the battle of Kurukshetra. Why did Vidura come to the palace? So he has got a very, very important work. He stayed there just to rectify the mentality of his eldest brother, Dhritarashtra. This was Vidura's purpose. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport very elaborately the significance of the visit of Vidura to this palace, Vasthinapura, and similarly the significance of the travel and the visit of saintly persons of the caliber of Vidura to the homes of householders who are generally forgetful of their spiritual responsibility in their ordinary dealings. They become absorbed materially.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is only the spiritual culture of the people concerned that makes interplanetary travel possible even in the present body."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the treatment of saintly persons like Vidura, the visits of devatas, Arjuna's visit to heavenly planets, Narada's unrestricted travel, and the role of spiritual culture in interplanetary travel.

So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, saintly persons like Vidura must be treated as well as a denizen from heaven. What's the meaning of this? In those days, denizens of heavenly planets used to visit homes like that of Maharaj Yudhishthira, and sometimes persons like Arjuna and others used to visit higher planets. Of course, nowadays we cannot see the devatas even if they visit the earth planet. First of all, devatas don't visit the earth planets in our present days because we are not engaged in so much in pious activities in Kali Yuga. Most people are not engaged in pious activities. They are busy with sense gratification for selfish interest. So devatas are not interested in visiting such a place. And also in former times some persons like Arjuna could visit higher planets. Arjuna visited the heavenly planet because he was exceptionally qualified for traveling like that. Then Srila Prabhupada gives the example of Narada. Srila Prabhupada says Narada is a spaceman who can travel unrestrictedly not only within the material universes but also in the spiritual universes. So Narada is a pure devotee. He has got all the mystic powers of a perfected yogi. A pure devotee has all the siddhis of a perfected yogi. So Narada can travel without the aid of a spacecraft everywhere within this universe, and he can even travel beyond the material universes to the spiritual world, to the personal abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vaikuntha and even in Goloka Brindavana. Narada can travel because he is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Therefore he can travel. Now about Narada, Srila Prabhupada says even Narada used to visit the palace of Maharaja Yudhishthira and what to speak of other celestial demigods. So devatas would visit Yudhishthira because Yudhishthira was very, very, very pious person, and not only that, he was himself a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. So Srila Prabhupada remarks here, it is only the spiritual culture of the people concerned that makes interplanetary travel possible.

**Key Quote:** "Only pure devotees can go even to Krishna's personal abode from this earth planet or from anywhere they can go."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's book 'Easy Journey to Other Planets', the limitations of earthly bodies for interplanetary travel, the role of Ashtanga Yoga, and the exclusive ability of pure devotees to reach Krishna's abode.

Srila Prabhupada has written a book called Easy Journey to Other Planets. In that book he says that in this present body, human beings who are not on the level of pure devotees, they cannot travel to upper planets in this earthly body. Not possible. They have to prepare themselves and change their bodies to actually transfer themselves to heavenly planets. Of course, if somebody practices Ashtanga Yoga and perfects the meditation process to achieve eight kinds of Siddhi, Ashta Siddhi, then they can travel to the higher planets. But even Ashta Siddhi does not qualify a yogi to go beyond the coverings of the universe. To go beyond the coverings of the universe to the spiritual sky or the spiritual planets requires that one be a pure devotee of Krishna. Only pure devotees can go even to Krishna's personal abode from this earth planet or from anywhere they can go. So they can freely travel.

**Key Quote:** "Vidura accepted out of his own mercy what was offered to him by Maharaja Yudhishthira, but the purpose of living in the palace was to deliver his elder brother Dhritarashtra."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Vidura's renounced order of life, the purpose of sannyasis visiting householders, and Vidura's specific mission to deliver his materially attached elder brother, Dhritarashtra.

So Narada being a pure devotee he can travel anywhere. Maharaja Yudhishthira therefore received Vidura in the manner of reception offered to the devatas or demigods. Further Srila Prabhupada says Mahatma Vidura had already adopted the renounced order of life and therefore he did not return to his paternal palace to enjoy some material comforts. This is a very important point that those who are in the renounced order of life, sannyasis, they should never visit any householder for enjoying a nice reception, for enjoying the comforts that the householders may offer to a saintly person or a sannyasi. No, never. So then why should they visit at all? It is explained here, Vidura accepted out of his own mercy what was offered to him by Maharaja Yudhishthira, but the purpose of living in the palace was to deliver his elder brother Dhritarashtra. This is the real purpose. Why should a sannyasi or a saintly person visit a householder? Just to deliver the householders who are otherwise absorbed in material activities. So here Srila Prabhupada says the purpose of Vidura visiting the palace and living there was to deliver his elder brother Dhritarashtra.

**Summary:** This segment explains Dhritarashtra's unhappiness after the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna's plan for devotees to administer the earth, and Dhritarashtra's continued material attachment despite losing everything.

Dhritarashtra somehow he was very unhappy that his sons could not succeed him. He was the caretaker king of the Hastinapura, the throne in Hastinapura, the royal throne. He was sitting in the in Hastinapura as the emperor of the world. But after the battle of Kurukshetra in which all his sons died in the battle he was very unhappy that his sons could not succeed him. Though by unfair means Duryodhana tried to kill the Pandavas, but Krishna protected the Pandavas and Krishna's plan was something different than what Duryodhana planned or Dhritarashtra desired. So Krishna's plan ultimately is that his representatives who are devotees who properly represent the Supreme Lord are meant to administer and rule this earth planet or any other planet for that matter. So Srila Prabhupada further explains how Dhritarashtra became materially attached. Dhritarashtra lost all his state. Dhritarashtra lost all his state and descendants in the fight with Maharaj Yudhishthira, and still due to his sense of helplessness he did not feel ashamed to accept the charity and hospitality of Maharaj Yudhishthira.

**Key Quote:** "It is a duty of enlightened souls to deliver the fallen ones and Vidura came for that reason."
**Summary:** This segment describes Yudhishthira's compassion for Dhritarashtra, the impropriety of Dhritarashtra accepting hospitality, and Vidura's mission to enlighten and deliver Dhritarashtra.

See, Maharaj Yudhishthira is very, very conscientious that he felt compassion for Dhritarashtra, that Dhritarashtra had lost all his sons and he was in that aggrieved state. Yudhishthira was particularly careful to comfort Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, his uncle and aunt, his father's brother and sister-in-law, to offer Dhritarashtra and Gandhari very nice facilities in the palace. So Srila Prabhupada says on the part of Maharaj Yudhishthira it was quite in order to maintain his uncle in a befitting manner. Yudhishthira was right in doing that. But acceptance of such magnanimous hospitality by Dhritarashtra was not at all desirable. Even though Yudhishthira offered Dhritarashtra very nice facility to stay very comfortably, but for Dhritarashtra it was not proper. He accepted it because he thought there was no alternative. Dhritarashtra thought there was what else do I have? But Vidura particularly came to enlighten Dhritarashtra and to give him a lift to the higher status of spiritual cognition. Vidura came to enlighten Dhritarashtra that his last days he should not spend comfortably living in a palace accepting all the kind hospitality of Yudhishthira. No. So Srila Prabhupada says it is a duty of enlightened souls to deliver the fallen ones and Vidura came for that reason. So Vidura came for the purpose of enlightening Dhritarashtra.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the refreshing nature of spiritual talks, their ability to attract everyone, the importance of attentive hearing, and the transformative power of hearing messages from the Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita to achieve Krishna consciousness.

And it will be explained in this chapter that Vidura was successful in impressing upon Dhritarashtra the importance of preparing himself to quit his body by becoming spiritually enlightened. But Srila Prabhupada further says but talks of spiritual enlightenment are so refreshing that while instructing Dhritarashtra, Vidura attracted the attention of all the members of the family and all of them took pleasure in hearing him patiently. Spiritual talks are always enlivening for the soul. Spiritual talks even though may be intended for particular people but it can be enlivening for everyone. Even the younger ones or those otherwise engaged can also become attracted by spiritually enlivening talks. This is the way of spiritual realization. The message should be heard attentively and if spoken by a realized soul it will act on the dormant heart of the conditioned soul. If we simply hear the spiritual messages from the Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad Gita it will work on our heart and our heart will get transformed and purified so that we can become Krishna conscious and prepare ourselves to go back to God.

#### Vidura's birth, Curse of Yamaraj, Lineage of Dhritarashtra and Pandu

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Vidura, born in the womb of a Shudra woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage, along with his brothers Dhritarashtra and Pandu."
**Summary:** This segment explains the story of Vidura's birth as the son of a maidservant, his relationship to Dhritarashtra and Pandu, and his resulting lack of inheritance rights.

The meaning of this verse is, as long as Vitura played the part of a Shudra, being cursed by Manduka Muni, Arhyama officiated at the post of Yamaraj to punish those who committed sinful acts. So in the Purport, Shila Prabhupada explains, already it has been told that Vitura was actually Yamaraj. Yamaraj was a Shudra. Yamaraj was cursed due to a small mistake, a slight mistake he did, in carrying out his official responsibility. And he was cursed by Manduka Muni. And therefore, he was born as Vitura in the womb of a Shudra woman. But actually, Prabhupada explains, the real reason why it was actually a higher arrangement by the Supreme Lord, that Yamaraj actually was cursed to take birth like that. So the hidden meaning of this particular incident is very nicely explained by Prabhupada in the Purport. So Shila Prabhupada says, Vitura, born in the womb of a Shudra woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage, along with his brothers Dhritarashtra and Pandu. If I may refresh your memory about who is Vitura, in terms of his relationship with Dhritarashtra and Pandu, all the three are sons of Vichitravirya, but they are posthumous children. They were born after Vichitravirya's death. And how were they born after Vichitravirya's death? This is called Deva-rena-suton-patti. That means, if a person is unable to conceive children, whatever may be the reason, why such a person, such a person is unable to conceive a child. The emperor of the world, he has to have sons who can succeed him. Qualified, capable, trained up sons. But Vichitravirya died untimely. So then there was nobody to ascend the throne. So then the mother of Vichitravirya, Satyavati, the wife of Shantanu, Vichitravirya's father, he, sorry, Satyavati, she called Vyasadeva and asked for a solution to this problem. So Vyasadeva agreed to impregnate the wives of Vichitravirya, Ampika and Ambalika, two queens. But it so happened that Vyasadeva, even though Vyasadeva was in perfect consciousness, but because he was undergoing severe austerities before he came to impregnate these wives of his brother, Deva and Sutrapati, means conceiving a child by the brother in the womb of one's own wife. So Vyasadeva was the son of Satyavati before her marriage with Shantanu. So Vyasadeva was called upon to impregnate these two queens so that they'll be good progeny for later on occupying the throne. So Dhritarashtra and Pandu were conceived by the two queens, but both of them were not conceived properly. So therefore, in order to conceive a third child, and one of the queens was asked to conceive a third child, but she, instead of conceiving one more child, she asked her maid to go in her place to conceive a child. And that royal maid actually was in very proper consciousness, and therefore, Vyasadeva conceived in that womb of the maiden, a maid servant, Yamaraj, who was cursed to be born as the son of a maid servant. So that was Vidura. So Vidura is actually a step-brother of Dhritarashtra and Pandu. So Dhritarashtra and Pandu were the two sons conceived in the queen. Even though they are conceived by Vyasadeva, they are considered sons of Vichitramirya. All the three are considered sons of Vichitramirya. But the son of the maid servant doesn't have the same position in terms of inheritance like the sons of the queen. So Dhritarashtra and Pandu inherited whatever the royal opulence, but entitled to inherit, but Vidura, as the son of a maid servant, was not entitled for that. So therefore, Srila Prabhupada is saying, Vidura, born in the womb of a Shudra woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage along with his brothers, Dhritarashtra and Pandu.

**Key Quote:** "Anyone who is conversant in the transcendental knowledge or the science of Godhead, be he a Brahmana or a Shudra...he is a Brahman."
**Summary:** This segment addresses the question of how Vidura, born a Shudra, could instruct learned Kshatriyas, explaining that spiritual qualification and transcendental knowledge are more important than birth.

So the question is being raised, how could Vidura occupy the post of a preacher to instruct such learned kings and Kshatriyas as Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Yudhishtira? If he is the son of a maid servant and he doesn't even have any inheritance, what is his authority to instruct and preach such learned Kshatriyas as Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Yudhishtira? So Srila Prabhupada gives the answer. The first answer is that even though it is accepted that Vidura was a Shudra by birth, because he renounced the word for spiritual enlightenment, by the authority of Rishi Maitreya, and was thoroughly educated by him in transcendental knowledge, he was quite competent to occupy the post of an Acharya, spiritual preceptor. So always the scriptures say, irrespective of birth, if somebody is trained up and has got the qualities of a Brahmana or a Kshatriya or even a Vaisya, even though he may be born in a Shudra family or a Shudra woman, still he is accepted as a Brahmana, Kshatriya or Vaisya according to qualification, training, the qualities he displays, etc. So Vidura was actually Yamaraja himself and even though he was born in the womb of a Shudra woman, he had all the good qualities because of which he was in a position to renounce and seek spiritual enlightenment by Maitreya Rishi and he was also thoroughly educated by Maitreya Rishi in transcendental knowledge. Therefore he was competent to occupy the post of an Acharya or a spiritual preceptor. Now Srila Prabhupada percourses Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. According to Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, anyone who is conversant in the transcendental knowledge or the science of Godhead, be he a Brahmana or a Shudra, a householder or a Sannyasi, kiba vipra kiba nyasi, shudra kenanaya, he Krishna tattva veta, he is a Brahman. If a person is born as a Shudra or if he is a Brahmana or in terms of ashrama, in terms of varana, whether he is a Brahmana or a Shudra doesn't matter. In terms of ashrama, whether he is a householder or a Sannyasi doesn't matter. As long as he is conversant with transcendental knowledge or the science of Krishna consciousness, he is a Brahmana. In terms of Akshara, he is a Brahmana of Krishna consciousness, he is eligible to become a spiritual master.

**Key Quote:** "One who knows in truth that science of Krishna consciousness...he is qualified to occupy the post of a spiritual master, a spiritual preceptor, a guru, a qualified guru."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that knowledge of Krishna consciousness qualifies one to be a spiritual master, regardless of birth, and references Chanakya Pandit's similar views.

ये कृष्ण तत्व वेव्तकृ। One who knows in truth that science of Krishna consciousness, such a person, से गुरु होये, he is qualified to occupy the post of a spiritual master, a spiritual preceptor, a guru, a qualified guru. Now Prabhupada also quotes Chanakya Pandit. Even in the ordinary moral quotes mentioned by Chanakya Pandit, the great politician and moralist, there is no harm in taking lessons from a person who may be by birth less than a Shudra, provided that person is qualified to impart lessons. So this birth is not important at all. That's what the Acharyas have taught us, that is what the scriptures teach us. That's what even Chanakya Pandit says. This is one part of the answer that Vidura is qualified. He has undergone thorough training by Maitreya Rishi. He has renounced the world for the sake of gaining spiritual enlightenment. So exceptionally qualified, even though he has taken birth in the womb of a maidservant.

#### Yamaraj's Incarnation, Mahajana, Authority on Dharma

**Key Quote:** "The second part of the answer is Vidura was not actually a Shudra. He was to play the part of a so-called Shudra."
**Summary:** This segment provides the second part of the answer, explaining that Vidura was actually the incarnation of Yamaraj, one of the twelve Mahajanas, and therefore an authority on Dharma.

That's the first part of the answer. Next is the other part of the reply for that question that was raised. How is he competent to instruct somebody like the Dhrashtra or Maharaja Yudhishthira? The second part of the answer is Vidura was not actually a Shudra. He was to play the part of a so-called Shudra for one hundred years being cursed by Manduka Muni. He was the incarnation of Yamaraj. And who is Yamaraj? Yamaraj is one of the twelve Mahajanas. Mahajanas means they are the authorities on Dharma. In the whole universe there are twelve Mahajanas. So Yamaraj is one of the twelve Mahajanas on the level with such exalted personalities as the other Mahajanas, Brahma, Narada, Shiva, Kapila, Bhishma, Prahlada, etc. So all these Mahajanas are the most exalted personalities in the whole universe. They are authorities on Dharma. So being a Mahajana, it is the duty of Yamaraj to preach the cult of devotion to the people of the world, as Narada, Brahma and other Mahajanas do. All the Mahajanas are first-class Mahabhagavatas, top-class Vaishnavas. And they preach the science of Krishna Consciousness to everyone. They are the most competent preachers of Krishna Consciousness. So, Prabhupada explains further. But Yamaraj is always busy in his platonic kingdom, punishing the doers of sinful acts. Yamaraj has got a duty. Even though he is a Mahajana, he is qualified, but he has got this duty of punishing the wrongdoers. So, he generally doesn't have much time to take leave from his responsible office of punishing the wrongdoers.

#### Krishna Leela, Pure Devotee, Transcendental Position

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Such a devotee is never a Shudra, or a Brahmana, or a householder, or a sannyasi. He is transcendental to all divisions of varna and ashrama."
**Summary:** This segment concludes by stating that Yamaraj took birth as Vidura to participate in Krishna Leela and that as a pure devotee, he is transcendental to all social divisions, making him qualified to preach to anyone.

Therefore, Yamaraj wanted to preach the glories of the Lord. By the will of the Lord, he was cursed to be born as a son of a Shudra. But he took birth at a time when Krishna had appeared as an incarnation. So, he participated in Krishna Leela. And also, he is an exalted devotee. Even though he is cursed, his consciousness doesn't become affected by the birth, because his activities are always those of a devotee in any body, in any situation, in any position. He is always a pure devotee, Mahabhagavata, fixed up in his position as a pure devotee. So, such a devotee is never a Shudra, or a Brahmana, or a householder, or a sannyasi. He is transcendental to all divisions of varna and ashrama. So, therefore, he is the most authorized and competent and most appropriate person to preach to anyone in the whole universe what to speak of preaching to Dhritarashtra. So, this is the explanation given. We should always understand him, Vidura, to be greater than the purest Brahmana because he is a pure devotee. He is also a Mahajan. Hare Krishna. I will stop here.
