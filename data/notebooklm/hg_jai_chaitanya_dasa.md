### Lord's enjoyment, free will, rasa, relationship

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So that one personality becomes many for the purpose of relationship, for the purpose of enjoyment."
**Summary:** The Lord creates living entities to experience relationships and enjoyment, granting them free will to facilitate genuine rasa.

So, it's a battle for the demon, but it is a friendly fight, a playful fight for the Supreme Lord. Because the Supreme Lord does not have to fight with anybody. Right? He can only fight with one person. That is himself. There is nobody else to fight with. But being the Supreme person, being a personality with all the emotions in its most supreme, excellent position, he also has the tendency to fight. What does he do? Just like he has a tendency to exchange emotions, he has a tendency to enjoy rasa, raso vai saha. He is full of rasa, and he is the enjoyer of all the rasas. So, what does he do? He has to create Radharani. He has to create all the sakis. He has to create all the devotees. He has to create all the living entities. So that one personality becomes many for the purpose of relationship, for the purpose of enjoyment. But if there has been enjoyment, and if there has been a relationship, then one thing he has to give up. He has to give up one thing. That is free will. If it doesn't give free will, if he is controlling the living entities he has created, if he is controlling all the people he has created, then it becomes... There is no rasa in that. Rasa comes when there is unexpected situations. You don't expect something. Suddenly something comes up. Then the enjoyment is more. If you already know what to expect, then there is no enjoyment there. When you receive something unexpectedly, then the rasa, the taste is more. You suddenly go somewhere you don't expect, suddenly get nice prasadam. Even though it is not tasty, you feel it is very tasty. You are very hungry. You didn't expect. So, to give that, rasa of the unknown, the Lord gives up the free will. So the living entities have only one thing. That is his free will. Everything else is Lord. He is also part of the Lord. Part and parcel of the Lord. There is no difference between the living entity and the Lord, except for the quantum. Both are spirit. Quantity wise maybe. So he gives that free will. So that is the free will which is used by the living entities. And using that free will, the Lord makes the living entity give him pleasure. The living entities are part and parcel of the Lord. So just like the part and parcel is used by the whole, the Supreme Lord uses the living entities by making the living entities act the way he wants.

### material world, friendly fight, Lord's love

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All the bad words you throw upon the Lord is received as a loving flower."
**Summary:** The material world is a place where living entities try to imitate the Lord, but the Lord responds with love, even to negative actions.

But many of the living entities are not qualified. All of them, like us, find place in this material world. So that is how the Supreme Lord exchanges relationships. So for him here, it is a friendly fight. Just like a father would fight. The gloves also father has given to the son. Right? Everything that the son has to fight the father. Suppose the father is a king. He wants to fight with the son. He gives a sword to the son. All the elements to fight is given by the father. And the father says, now you fight. Right? Sometimes the father shows he is also defeated. Because the father feels pleasure in the success of the son. Similarly, the Lord also feels pleasure in the success of the living entities. Only one thing is not possible when the living entities start imitating and acting like the Lord. That is not possible. Because there is only one Lord. So when Hiranyakasya, Hiranyakashipu, all the living entities try to act like the Lord, then, still the Lord is loving. The Lord doesn't say, you are dismissed. You are banned. If he bans, where will the living entity go? So he himself has to create the living entity's place. So he creates a material world. And he says, all of you go there and try to become like me. So we have Hiranyakasya and Hiranyakashipu here. Trying to fight the Lord. But what is the use of fighting the Lord? All the bad words you throw upon the Lord is received as a loving flower. All the beating that Hiranyakasya does to the Lord is also received to him as pleasure. So you cannot overcome that. You cannot overcome the Lord in any way. That's not possible. The living entity can get overcome by the Lord's love. So that is the interaction between the Lord and the living entities.

### Lord's incarnations, Varaha, humility

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord doesn't mind even taking such an so-called abominable, so-called lowly, so-called not cared for form of varaha."
**Summary:** The Lord takes even the most humble forms, like Varaha, for the pleasure of Himself and His devotees, demonstrating His all-encompassing nature.

And this material world, of course, is created. And in this material world, the Lord comes in most abominable form also. He doesn't mind. Paraha. Hedgehog, they say. Most abominable. Like before we saw Hiranyakasya, he is saying, you are such a lowly being you are. Lowly being of this, of a hog, of a varaha. Wild boar. Nobody cares for a wild boar. Why did he take the form of a wild boar? Because earth is lost. It has been sniffed. It has been smelled and found out. And nobody is as expert as smelling like wild boar. You cannot keep anything away from a wild boar. It will sniff and find out. It is a very lowly animal, but very expert. His sense of smelling is so strong. Right? Hiranyakasya cannot even hide earth from it. He will smell and find out. That is why boar incarnation. Just smell out the earth. Right? So human beings don't care for this. The Lord doesn't mind even taking such an so-called abominable, so-called lowly, so-called not cared for form of varaha. He doesn't mind. Varaha is very useful also. The mud which is tilled by the horns, by the horns of the varaha is very useful. They say, when for worship, we use this soil from the anthill, we use soil from the tulasi root, we use soil from the horn. In the morning, in the night, the hogs come and they till the soil to take the roots and eat. So that soil is used. When we do Brahmosa, we do Ankura Arbana, we use soil from different places. One of the soil is the soil from the horn, tilled by the horn of varaha. So we may not understand the usefulness of varaha anyway. So the point here is, the Lord doesn't mind taking this kind of form also for the pleasure of His pleasure and the pleasure of the devotees.

### dodging death, transcendentalism, detachment

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So the process of dodging death, that is the goal of life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord dodges the maze of Hiranyaksha like a transcendentalist dodges death, which is achieved by disconnecting from the material world and identifying as spirit soul.

So that is the situation here. But here, Sukte Goswami very clearly explains, the Lord is dodging the maze of hidden action. So if you look at it, He is dancing, sidestepping, maze fight. Duryodhana, Bhima, all these people are great maze fighters. So we look at the maze fighters, if you look at any fighter, you have to see, you have to block others beating, you have to avoid others beating, you have to give a punch. So it is a real fighting. There is a big war going on there. So the Lord is dodging the maze, maze blows of hidden action, just like a transcendentalist would dodge death. So He gives that comparison. So the transcendentalists are expert in dodging death. How does that happen? Well, in the sense, dodging death means you avoid the influence of the material world, because death is part of this material world. Soul doesn't die. So when soul doesn't die, who is dying here? Transcendentalist doesn't die. He is soul. How can soul die? It is the body which is dying. Body which is a part of the material world, which is dying. Body which is the product of the influence of the three modes of material nature, which is dying. And He was never that body. So transcendentalists never die. It is the living entities who think that He is a body, which has an end, think that there is death. For a spiritualist, there is no death. So the Lord is dodging this maze, just like a Vaishnava, a Brahmana, a qualified spiritualist who avoids death. Well, not only the Vaishnavas, even a Mayavadi tries to dodge death. Any transcendentalist, whether he is a Mayavadi, he is a yogi, he is a Brahmana, he is a Vaishnava, they all dodge death. But dodging death is possible only when you disconnect with the material world. Until that disconnect comes, because you think, I am the body. As long as we think that we are the body, and the body ends, we cannot dodge.

### goal of life, body consciousness, transcendental qualities
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=780

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The goal of life is to avoid death."
**Summary:** The goal of life is to avoid death by understanding that we are not the body, leading to freedom from anxiety and a sense of unlimited abundance.

So the process of dodging death, that is the goal of life. For the living entities who are this material world. Most of the people in the material world do not know what is the goal of life. So if they ask us, we will say, the goal of life is to avoid death. A scientist will say, not possible, you are wasting your time, because you have to die. Because he is thinking that he is the body. But a devotee is thinking that he is not the body. He knows he is not the body. The fact is that he is not the body. When he is a spirit soul, how does death overcome spirit soul? Death overcomes spirit soul as soon as the spirit soul mis-sanitizes himself as a dieable object. So people in the material world, when we are absorbed in sense gratification, absorbed in the body, conscious of the body, the consciousness is always thinking of the body, the body's pleasures, body's pains, avoiding body's pain, acquiring body's happiness, when the entire action in his life is centered around the body, then he becomes body conscious. When he becomes body conscious, then he becomes death conscious. A transcendentalist is not death conscious. Because he doesn't die. He doesn't disappear into thin air. He is always existing. So when he understands that, the first thing that comes in his heart is happiness. Because all unhappiness is because you think this is going to finish. All sadness, all anxiety happens because I think I am going to lose this. So when you know that you are always going to exist, there is no point in finishing, then you don't have anxiety. So first sign of transcendentalist is free from anxiety. First sign is his tripti, he is satisfied. Why? Because he has no anxiety, he doesn't finish. So he is always rejoicing, he is always happy. So the quality of a transcendentalist is this, he is free from this fear, he is free from this anxiety, he is free from this dissatisfied situation of material things that I have only this much. I have everything. Because the Lord has everything. I am part of the Lord. Whatever belongs to the Lord is mine. There is no limit for a devotee. There is no limitation for a transcendentalist who thinks that he is not the body. So that is the qualification

### dodging death, tridoshas, trigunas
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=947
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So as soon as you become free from the three modes, you become free from death."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that dodging death is a daily fight to balance the trigunas and tridoshas, ultimately leading to freedom from the influence of the material world.

of a transcendentalist. The point, how does he avoid? So that is the process every individual person, a sadhaka, like us, the whole day, whole life is spent in how do we dodge? We dodge disease, illness. Nobody wants disease. Keep good health. I know they say, tridoshas, you have tridoshas. Any imbalance in this tridoshas creates ill health. So we maintain this balance of these tridoshas so that you don't become ill. There is no disease. The same way it is said that you have to maintain trigunas, balance of trigunas because mind is influenced by these trigunas. So as much as the balance of the trigunas are important for the body, the balance of the tridoshas are important for the body, the balance of trigunas are important for the mind because happiness is what? It is a mental concept. Body is unhappy when it is diseased. Mind is happy when it is free from the influence of three modes or it has more of sattva guna. So this is the daily fight a transcendentalist faces. How does he balance or rather how does he avoid the three modes of material nature? Triguna rahitaha. How to be free from the influence of three modes? So as soon as you become free from the three modes, you become free from death. For such a person, there is no death. Vaishnava has never died. In fact, no living entity dies. But Vaishnava has never died because he is totally free from this concept of death. He is free from the influence of the three modes of material nature.

### material world, upside-down tree, three modes
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=1057
**Verse References:** BG 15.1
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This world is nothing but an upside down of a good world."
**Summary:** Drawing from the 15th chapter of Gita, the speaker describes the material world as an upside-down tree, nourished by the three modes of material nature, and sustained by the actions of living entities.

So that is why Krishna as in 15th chapter he says, a person who understands this material world, he understands very clearly what is happening in this world. Hence he says, what is this world? In 15th chapter of Gita, most important chapter, where Krishna says, urdhamulam adasyakam. You want to know what this world is? This world is nothing but an upside down of a good world. This is a perverted reflection of the right world. This is a wrong house. This is an upside down house. You belong to a house which is totally different. But I can try to explain to you, this world is an upside down world. And this is like a tree which is standing on a reservoir. The reflection is seen on the reservoir. The roots are up. The branches are down. The leaves are down. The leaves are the Vedas. The twigs are the fruits of the senses, objects of the senses. Sense activities. And this tree also has new roots coming. This tree also has new shoots coming. And this tree is fed by the three modes of material nature, sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna. It is like growing up a tree using manure. What is the manure for this tree? Urea for this tree is sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna. These three gunas are the nutrients by which the tree is growing. And what is the fruit of the tree? The new twigs. And all this is resting in the action of the living entities. If the living entity is acting in this material world, using these three gunas, sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna, which are the nutrients, naturally new roots will come. Just like in a banyan tree, new roots come. Very thin roots come. When they are very small, easy to pick and throw. But as they touch the ground, and they also start sucking the three gunas, the nutrients, they also grow strong. So by the action of the living entities, by the influence of three modes of material nature, the nutrients are going to this tree called samsara. And this tree called samsara is growing and growing and growing. And it comes to a point where you cannot cut it anymore easily. The more nutrient is taken, the tree becomes very strong. You cannot cut it. A tree which is very small, you can easily take it away. But allow it to grow. Allow the extra roots to come. Who is feeding it? Nobody external is coming and feeding it. We ourselves are feeding it by our action. What kind of action? The actions which are influenced by either sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna or a combination of these. So actions in this material world,

### bondage, liberation, free will
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=1235

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Actions in this material world, is a cause of bondage."
**Summary:** Actions influenced by the three modes cause bondage, but by using free will to act in a way that leads to liberation, one can dodge death.

is a cause of bondage. And Lord says, he who knows this tree, he can dodge death. He can be free from the influence of this tree. Don't try to understand this tree. You figuratively know what this tree is, but don't try to go deep to the tree. But what the transcendentalist do? He doesn't go deep. He takes a knife and cuts the roots. As fast as possible, he can cut the roots and come out of this bondage to this earth. And you belong to a different world. Not that bhaa sheti, surya ho, na shashanko, na pavaka ha. A world where there is no need of any artificial light. A world where there is no need of any sadness, no sorrow, no limitation, no anxiety. A world which is totally free. So we belong to a world which is as free as them. As free as that. But now we belong to a world where there is limitations by death. Hence, a transcendentalist becomes expert in dodging death. Cheat death. How does he do that? The medicine is with him. His own actions. When a transcendentalist uses his action through his free will, in a particular way, he gets bound. When he uses his free will in another way, he gets liberated. So that one item what the Lord has given, that is a free will, action means free will. You are free to act whichever you want. So he has given that free will. The same free will with which you would give pleasure to the Lord is now misused to become sad. Is misused to be limited by death. Is misused to be mixed in anxiety. So spiritual life only means that taking that aspect of action and putting that action in a different place which gives better result and the result is liberation. And when these actions are used in the activity of liberation, then you are called a person who is dodging death.

### dodging death, constant vigilance, Lord's emotions
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=1372
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You have to dodge death every minute because any second you can get stuck."
**Summary:** Dodging death requires constant vigilance and cutting the roots of material attachment, and the Lord also displays emotions like fear and anxiety for the sake of His devotees.

And that is the goal of life. Every minute, every second, that is a Buddha Yoga. This is not some artificial emotion, this is a Buddha Yoga. It is a minute to minute thing. You have to dodge death every minute because any second you can get stuck. Like in Gita, Krishna says any one of the senses, inattentively, can create another root. Root is going so fast. So you have to be a very smart fighter. Take the knife and you have to be very fast. Every time keep cutting, cutting, cutting. What am I doing this medieval? Keep cutting the roots. Thin the tree down. Don't allow the tree to go lost. And this tree, where is the tree growing? In our hearts. So if this material tree is made to grow thick by our misused actions, misplaced actions in the material world, then we end up in dying. The moment we take it out, we become free from death. No death. Hence just like a transcendentalist who is trying to dodge death, the Lord is fighting. So the cue here is how does a transcendentalist dodge death? That becomes the goal of life. Apparently it looks like the Lord is in anxiety. He is trying to get freedom from this maze, powerful maze of Hirinaksha. He is scared of Hirinaksha. Lord also shows his emotions of fear. Arjuna caused so much of fear to the Lord. We know when Abhimanyu was killed. Arjuna was so struck with sorrow. He forgot what he see, what he should say. He said, if I don't kill this person tomorrow, I will die. He said, what are you saying? This is exactly what the Kauravas are looking at. Either to kill you or make a situation where you die yourself. Kshatriyas are like that. If they don't commit, if they don't do what they say, then they say, okay, I give up this. I give up that. I kill myself. I enter fire. Arjuna said, I will enter fire. The Lord said, the Lord said, I didn't sleep in the night. The Lord also doesn't sleep in the night. He also has anxiety. For what? For the cause of the devotees. So the Lord has this rasas. Why? Because this world is real. There is pain and pleasure in this world. There is endeavor in this world. There is hard work in this world. There is frustration in this world.

### endeavor, karma, Lord's sanction, dodging death
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=1542
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This world is made so real, that one has to endeavor."
**Summary:** The material world is a place of endeavor, limited by karma and time, but ultimately controlled by the Lord's sanction, and dodging death means dodging these influences.

This world is made so real by the Lord that we have to struggle. Three things are there in this world. One is our endeavor. Every time we endeavor for something to success, achieve something. Free from hatred, free from happiness, free from unhappiness, or achieve happiness. These are two things we do. Endeavor is always there. But we are limited. We are not free to endeavor. Not that you do anything, you will get the result. You are limited by time. Limited by our past. Limited by our own karma. Right? And then, even if you have good karma, sometimes you may not get it. Why? Large interference is there. So this world is made so real, that one has to endeavor. While endeavoring, one is limited by one's past. And even if it is limited by the past, if the Lord's sanction is there, you get it. So by seeing this world, one understands there is something different. Somebody is controlling this world. I am not free. If I was free, I should work hard and I should get the result. But you see people working hard, opposite result. Viparyaya, you get the opposite. You try for something, but you get the exact opposite. Or sometimes people don't work at all, he is getting everything automatically. So big debate in Shastra is, what is the reason for result in this world? Is it endeavor? Is it karma? Or the Lord? Of course, it is a combination of all these three. So Krishna has created this world where he makes the living entities endeavor. Work hard, work hard, work hard. Again action. Again free will. The same free will what he has given to the living entities, he is making the living entities work hard. Endeavor, endeavor, endeavor. But, you have come and gone many times here. So many pending accounts are there. It depends upon that. Even great athletes work hard day and night they work. On the day of the play, no result. So they say, I didn't have a good day. So having good day is important or struggling for so many years is important. Why struggle at all? Some people don't struggle at all. You have a good day by your past karma. So the world is made so real by the Lord, by a combination of all these things. And the living entities who understand this, he knows, I am limited by all these things. And finally, I am limited by death. So how do you dodge death? Say a person dodging death means he dodges all these influences of karma, influences of time, influences of the three modes. Then he can dodge.

### practical spiritual life, expanding Krishna consciousness, action
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=1722
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Totally be absorbed in expanding this movement."
**Summary:** Spiritual life is not sentimentalism but practical action, and Prabhupada advises devotees to be absorbed in expanding the Krishna consciousness movement as the best way to be free from Maya.

So this world is a very practical world. It is not just, and spiritual life is not just sentimentalism. Like Prabhupada said, it's an art of working. It's a place of action. A lot of activities are happening. The devotees are engaged. When devotees ask Prabhupada, what is the best way to be free from Maya? How to be free? It's very difficult to be free. We are sitting in Maya. Sitting in the influence of all these modes. Prabhupada says, totally be absorbed in expanding this movement. It's very difficult to be free. Totally be absorbed in expanding this movement. Because expanding this movement means what? This problem, that problem, this thing, that thing, this devotee, that devotee, man, material, all kinds of problems are there. So sometimes we think, is this spiritualism? I thought ashram means vishram. Ashram means vishram. Prabhupada said, this is not a place of vishram. It's a place of action. It's a place of great battle. Great problem. We don't think. We come in a temple, we sit and everything is there. Prasad comes in time. Dress comes in time. Vehicle comes and stops. So sometimes we forget. There is a great endeavor required to achieve all these things. But Krishna gives all these things free for the devotees.

### dodging death, Krishna consciousness, real world
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=1817
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Engage in Krishna consciousness. Engage in expansion of Krishna consciousness."
**Summary:** Dodging death is easily achieved by engaging in Krishna consciousness and expanding the movement, and the material world is real because it gives the real fruit of liberation.

Why does Krishna give these things free for the devotees? So internally, he can engage all these things in Krishna's service. So Prabhupada says, we want to be from maya. So dodging death, a transcendentally sitting om, doing all these hatha yogas, controlling his breath, controlling the five ayus in the body, detaching the mind from the senses, or a mayavadi saying, neti neti neti, not this, not this, not this, and trying to be away from this material world. A devotee, free. Easily he can dodge death. What is it? Engage in Krishna consciousness. Engage in expansion of Krishna consciousness. Such a simple formula Prabhupada has given. Dodging death? No problem. No need of hatha yoga. No need of mental speculations. No need of even Sankhya yoga. Sankhya yoga is also one of the methods of dodging death. Analyzing this material world and finding out the intrinsic. Sarvasya sarvaatmana atmavasthuna. The Lord is everywhere. He is in, He is the heart of everything and He is also the intrinsic aspect of everything. Intrinsic quality of everything. There is nothing other than Him. No need of that also. Simply act. Simply act in the activity of preaching. Expanding the movement. So it's a real world. In this real world, mayavadis say this world is not real. Devotees don't say that. This world is real. As much as its temporariness is understood, but it is real. Because if it is unreal, you won't get a real fruit. Just like you say, this is an image of a mango tree, but I got real mango. You can't get a real mango from an image of a mango tree. You have to go to a real mango tree, climb and get the fruits. So if liberation is the fruit of the actions in the material world, how can I get liberation from a false world? And a false world? Non-existing world? So the understanding of the devotee is that the world is Bhagavata understanding. Bhagavata conclusion is that the world is not unreal. World is real. Because it gives real fruit, which is liberation.

### purpose of the world, growing roots, free will

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Action is the only way to get liberation."
**Summary:** The purpose of the world is to achieve liberation, and devotees should avoid growing roots in material attachments, using their free will to dodge death through practical action.

That is the purpose of the world. You may not use it for that purpose. You may use it for your own sense gratification. Then you get caught up in that. Many times people get caught up in this world of materialism and get frustrated. When they get frustrated, they say the world is not real. When they are enjoying, they don't say the world is not real. But the devotee may be utilizing everything in this material world. He may enjoy also. Ambarish Maharaj, Dhruva Maharaj, all these people, they enjoy the material world, according to their karma. But, they were not growing roots. By the action of Dhruva Maharaj, even though he was a king and ruling, he didn't grow roots. The problem is growing roots. Similarly, in our preaching movement, when we preach and engage in Krishna consciousness, we should see that roots are not grown. We don't get stuck with a particular service. We don't get stuck with a particular situation. We don't get stuck with a particular position. We don't get stuck with a particular concept. Everything is the roots of, if the roots are built here, then there is no difference between the activity inside and activity outside. Because action is the only way to get liberation. And that action is nothing but the real form of free will. Because there cannot be any action if free will is not there. So this particular thing which the Lord has given to the living entities is used, and the purpose of the use is to dodge death. So the Lord's action here is, is nicely compared by Sukhothi Goswami. And that is the purpose. This is why Sukhothi Goswami is, he brings out these concepts in Bhagavatam, which force us to realize, by realization, the Lord's presence, and how to reach him in this practical world, through practical action. No unnecessary sentimentalism. Practical action.

**Key Quote:** "Bhirachandra Prabhu then took the stone back to Kardaha by floating it into the Ganges, as if it was too heavy to board onto a boat."
**Summary:** This segment narrates the story of how Bhirachandra Prabhu obtained the Shaligram Shila from the Nawab's palace in Murshidabad, highlighting the miraculous transformation of food into flowers and the floating of the stone on the Ganges.

It is stated in Prema Vilasa that Sri Bhirachandra Prabhu, after having received appropriate instructions from his father, Nithyananda Prabhu, to install Sri Shamasundraji in Kardaha, had set out to obtain the Shaligram Shila from the Nawab's palace in Murshidabad, from which the deity needed to be carved. Sri Bhirachandra Prabhu's reputation preceded him, and the Nawab greeted him with full honor on his arrival. However, the Nawab had evil intentions. Sri Bhirachandra's vow of feeding him meat. Hence, the Nawab thought that feeding meat to this great Vaishnava would end up derailing him from his religious path and shall thereby spoil his reputation. However, when Nawab attempted to serve him the non-veg dishes, the food automatically got transformed into roses and jasmine. The Nawab ordered his chief to bring new items. But again, the potency of Sri Bhirachandra, the food got transformed into flowers. The Nawab got frustrated in his attempts and finally came to realize that Sri Bhirachandra Prabhu was a great devotee and no ordinary personality. Feeling remorseful and guilty, the Nawab fell at his lotus feet and begged him for forgiveness. Bhirachandra Prabhu, feeling merciful, forgave him. Bhirachandra Prabhu then informed the Nawab, "I saw you eating the food. I saw a huge stone above your front gate. I would be happy to have it so that I can carve a nice deity out of it." The Nawab was very happy to give his consent. Bhirachandra Prabhu then took the stone back to Kardaha by floating it into the Ganges, as if it was too heavy to board onto a boat. To the surprise of all, the Shaligramma stone floated down the river and ultimately reached the banks of Kardaha, where it was carefully recovered.

**Key Quote:** "The third deity which manifested from the Shaligramma Silla was an exact match."
**Summary:** This segment describes the process of carving the deity of Lord Shamsundara from the Shaligram Shila, the rejection of the first two deities, and the grand installation festival performed by Achyutananda.

While meditating at Kunjavatika, Sri Bhirachandra had received the beautiful darshana of Sri Shamsundaraji in his heart. In his trance, he received orders from his father, Nithyananda Prabhu, to fetch the Shaligramma Silla from the Nawab's place and subsequently install Shamsundaraji here in Kardaha. This concerned Shaligramma Silla had a long history. This was the same stone on which Kamsa, the wicked maternal uncle of Sri Krishna, had murdered the six children of Devaki over 5000 years ago. Somehow the stone had landed up in the custody of the Nawab. As Bhirachandra Prabhu entered the Nawab's palace, he noticed that the stone was perspiring and understood that it was the same Shaligramma Silla that he had come looking for. Sri Bhirachandra then engaged a sculptor who fulfilled his earnest desire by carving the captivating deity of Lord Shamsundara from this Shaligramma Silla. The first two deities that were sculpted didn't match the exact form of Shri Shamsundaraji that Bhirachandra had witnessed in his meditation. Hence, he sent these first two deities to Shirampur and Saiban, where they are worshipped today as Shri Radha Vallabhji and Shri Radha Nandudulalji respectively. The third deity which manifested from the Shaligramma Silla was an exact match, and Shri Bhirachandra then proceeded to install and worship it. Indeed, the people of Kardaha forgot their distress when they saw this most attractive deity. Bhirachandra Prabhu arranged a grand festival to install the deity with great pomp and show, and so, inviting many devotees and feeding all of them sumptuously, the most merciful Achyutananda, the son of Advaitacharya, performed the abhisheka of Shri Radha Shamsundaraji.

Soon, Sunanda gave birth to a beautiful child who was later named Govinda. A few years after Govinda was born, his father Chiranjeeva passed away. Being raised at his maternal father's home at Shrikanta, Govinda was brought up amidst Saktas or devotees of Maa Durga. As compared to his brother Ramachandra, who was a Krishna Bhakta, Govinda since his childhood was a worshipper of Bhagavati Devi, Goddess Durga. After Sunanda Devi passed away, both Ramachandra and Govinda shifted to Kumar Nagar. It was here at Kumar Nagara that Ramachandra Kaviraj got married to Ratnamala Devi and subsequently surrendered himself to Srinivasa Acharya. Soon afterwards, Ramachandra and Govinda decided to shift to the...

**Summary:** This segment narrates the relocation to Talia Budhari, Ramachandra's desire for association with Srinivasa Acharya, and the incident where Durga acknowledges Krishna's supremacy through the lotus offering.

peaceful and blissful village of Talia Budhari near Bhagavangola. So Bhagavangola was not the birthplace of Ramachandra Kaviraj. This was the place they stayed most, where they already had some land. Ramachandra insisted on shifting to Telia Bandhura because he felt that over here he would receive more association with Srinivasa Acharya and would have to pass over Telia Budhari to reach to Sripata of Narottam Das at Rajshahi. As presented before, Ramachandra and Narottama subsequently became the best friends and could hardly tolerate separation from each other. It is mentioned in Bhakti Ratnakara: Talia Budhari Grame A Govindera Stiti... by Nirjana Sthaneti Prita Aati... Budhari Paschime Sri Paschima Paranama... Tata Sarva Rambhe Bhas Seho Ramya Sthana. Devi Durga honors the offered lotus flowers in her hand. Adjacent to the residence of Govinda Kaviraj at Talia Budhari existed two ponds, which were commonly known as Jodha Pukura, pair of ponds. Innumerable lotuses adorned these ponds. I don't know whether you noticed yesterday there was a small pond with lotus. Flower was not there but leaves were there. So once, while Ramachandra Kaviraj was passing by these ponds, he was enthralled to note its beauty. In his mind, he then offered a couple of lotus flowers unto Lord Govinda, his worshipable Ishta Deva. Who are the deities in Bhagwan Gola? So later, when Govinda Kaviraj plucked these same lotus flowers and offered them unto his worshipable Devi Durga, as he did every day, he was shocked to discover that Maa Durga was holding these lotus flowers in her hands, instead of them lying at her feet. So the lotus flower was offered at the feet, but she offered it to the Lord and it was held in her hand. He understood, later he understood that Lord Krishna is the worshipable master of Maa Durga.

**Summary:** This segment details Govinda's illness, his prayer to Durga, and Durga's instruction to meditate on Krishna's lotus feet for liberation.

And hence, anything offered to Krishna is sacred to all, including the goddess. One day, while Srinivasa and Ramachandra were sitting together, a messenger arrived carrying a letter from Govinda Kaviraj. In that letter, Govinda expressed that he was critically ill and requested his brother, Ramachandra, to come and see him at Telliya Budhari. Ramachandra did not want to take leave from his spiritual master and so he hid the letter. A few days later, Govinda wrote a second letter, expressing that his health has deteriorated further and wished to see Ramachandra and Srinivasa Charya. Actually, Govinda was a staunch devotee of Goddess Durga and he prayed to the Goddess for his mercy. It is said that he had reached a perfectional stage in his worship of Goddess and had even seen her face to face. So when Govinda asked for liberation from her and requested her to bestow her mercy so that he could cross over the ocean of birth and death, the Goddess instructed him to meditate upon the lotus feet of Lord Krishna instantly. If he wished to be delivered, the Goddess revealed that she herself meditates upon and worships the reddish feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Krishna alone can deliver one from the clutches of material birth and death. Maa Durga added that there are hundreds of Durgas, Sivas and Brahmas who are constantly engaged in offering prayers and singing the glories of Lord Krishna. But they are yet to reach the end of Supreme Lord's unlimited glories. Only fools refuse to surrender unto Krishna...

On realizing that Krishna was indeed his worshipable Supreme Lord, Brahma felt very ashamed. As atonement, he arrived at present-day Mayapur and began meditating upon the blissful form of Gaurahari, Lord Chaitanya, who is none other than Lord Krishna, and became very pleased and knowing the desire of Brahma granted him the boon that he would become an intimate associate of the Lord when he would next appear in this material world.

According to the revealed scriptures, Srila Haridas Thakur was born in the village of Buron, which is presently situated in the Kulna district of Bangladesh. However, no trace of this residence exists today at this place. Is it still called Buron? Hiraganj. But when we went there, it was surprising that nobody would believe that he is born in a Muslim family. They say he is a Hindu, his father's name is this, his mother's name is this, but just that he was very closely associating with Muslims because the whole area was only Mohammedan. So it's both sides people talk. But according to our acharyas and scriptures, he is born Muslim.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates a story of Haridasa Thakura experiencing ecstasy while watching a snake charmer perform and sing about Krishna's pastimes.

It is right across the stream. This is the southernmost part we would be in Bangladesh. After this, we would move northwards. In fact, your mobile phone will show home time. This is not the exact time, right? It shows 4.15, but it's actually 4.45, because mobile phone thinks you are back in India. Many pastimes were there, of Haridas Thakur, miraculous pastimes, small, different places. There is one mentioned here in Chaitanya. There's a story of Haridas Thakur, a snake charmer and a snake. One day, in the courtyard of a rich man's house, a snake charmer was performing a snake dance. He was chanting a special mantra accompanied by musicians playing the Mridanga and Manjira. Haridas was passing by and stood to one side watching the snake dance. Although the snake charmer was an ordinary human being, by the influence of his mantra he could dance as though the spirit of the king of the snakes Ananta Sesha possessed him. With an enchanting melody he sang about the pastime of Lord Krishna in the lake called Kaliadaha where the Lord had vanquished an evil serpent called Kalia. Haridasa listened intently to the pastime of his beloved Lord Krishna and he suddenly moved by ecstasy he fell unconscious to the ground when he regained consciousness. He jumped to his feet and rode like a lion, dancing in ecstasy as he babbled with joy. The snake charmer was impressed by the manifestation of ecstatic symptoms in Haridas Thakur's body and stood respectful to the sight. As the various symptoms of horripilation, crying and shivering traversed Haridas' body, he rolled in the dust, crying in love for Krishna. He remembered how his beloved Lord had mercifully saved the snake Kalia and as he floated in ecstatic trance, the people around him obliged by singing songs about the wonderful pastimes of the Lord. The snake charmer simply stood to the sight, overcome by awe and reverence for Haridas.

**Key Quote:** "By seeing Srila Haridas Thakura dance, one becomes liberated from material bondage."
**Summary:** The story continues with a Brahmana attempting to imitate Haridasa's ecstasy for recognition, but is punished by the snake charmer, who then explains the true nature and glories of Haridasa Thakura.

When his ecstasy subsided, Haridas left and the snake charmer resumed his performance. Everyone who witnessed the ecstasy of Haridas felt spiritually accelerated and they smeared their bodies with dust from his feet. However, one cunning and insightful Brahmana in the crowd decided to cheat the people. He also started dancing. He told himself, I can see that the people are not very intelligent. They are offering so much respect to this low-born Haridas, just because he dances and cries. If I, a Brahmana, also dance and cry, then they will certainly worship me as well. The Brahmana threw himself on the ground and feigned unconsciousness as though he had fallen into trance. However, as soon as he touched the ground, the dancing snake charmer became furious, picked up a stick and began beating the Brahmana relentlessly. He struck him repeatedly. He hit him on every part of his body until the Brahmana, howling in agony, got up and ran away just to save his life. The snake charmer then resumed his dance while the entire crowd stood dumbfounded. At last, a man with folded hands humbly requested the snake charmer to explain why he had stood respectfully to the side while Haridas danced, yet he had beaten the Brahmana for what seemed to be the same activity. The spirit of Ananda Sesha, who dwelt within the snake charmer, then spoke in glorification of Srila Das Thakura. The subject matter of your inquiry is very confidential. Although such a topic is rarely discussed, because of its highly esoteric nature, I shall nevertheless answer your question. When Srila Das Thakura was dancing in ecstatic trance, each one of us felt it. Our respect and affection for him spontaneously increased. However, the deceitful Brahmana was simply imitating Haridasa in order to get some cheap adoration from the crowd, not out of love for Krishna, but out of enviousness towards a pure devotee. The Brahmana threw himself on the ground in ecstasy. Furthermore, he interrupted by dancing. Since he disturbed me and tried to imitate the pure devotee, I punished him severely. This arrogant and deceitful Brahmana has no love for Krishna. To receive the shelter of devotional service at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, one has to become pure, free from deceit. By seeing Srila Haridas Thakura dance, one becomes liberated from material bondage. Even the Supreme Lord Krishna himself dances when he sees Srila Dasa Thakura dance. The entire universe becomes cleansed of all sinful reactions just by seeing Srila Haridas dance.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Haridasa Thakura's humility and explains that his birth in a low-caste family demonstrates the futility of material designations and the importance of devotion.

He is truly worthy of his name, Haridasa Thakura, the servant of the Supreme Lord, Hare Krishna, who shines eternally like a full moon in the heart of his devotees. Haridasa is affectionate and compassionate towards all living entities, and he descends as the eternal servant of the Supreme Lord in each of the Lord's incarnations. He is free from any fault or offense towards the Supreme Lord or his devotees. Even in his dreams, he never commits an offense. A moment's association with Haridasa can purify any living entity and assure him the eternal shelter of Lord Krishna's lotus feet. Even Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva constantly desire his association. Haridas appeared in the family of a lowly Muslim on the order of the Supreme Lord, just to teach human society that material designations like caste, creed, birth, status and family positions are all illusory and pursuing them is futile. A pure devotee of the Lord is born in a low-class family. He is no less worthy of worship. This is injunction of the scriptures.

On the other hand, if someone is born in a sophisticated family but does not worship the lotus feet of Sri Krishna, then his high birth is useless, for he lives just like a resident of hell. Just to prove the truth of these scriptures, Srila Haridas took birth in a low-caste family. Prahlad Maharaj, one of the greatest devotees of the Lord, had previously appeared in a family of demons. And Hanuman, the greatest devotee of Lord Ramachandra, took birth in the monkey species. The demigods desired the touch of the pure and transcendental form of Srila Haridas Thakura. And Ganga Mata also prays that her water will be sanctified by his presence. However, one need not touch Srila Das Thakura. By seeing him, simply by seeing him, one is automatically freed from the eternal cycle of birth and death. Furthermore, one who sees a devotee who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Haridas Thakura is also granted freedom from material bondage. Neither a thousand mouths nor a thousand ears would be sufficient to describe and hear the wonderful qualities of Srila Haridas Thakura. You are a fortunate soul, for your inquiry has given me an opportunity to glorify the pure devotee and has given you the opportunity to hear the transcendental topic. From the moment a person speaks the name Srila Haridas Thakura, his ascension to the supreme abode of Lord Krishna is guaranteed.

**Key Quote:** "If one actually chants the holy name without offences, his ecstatic love for the lotus feet of Lord Krishna is awakened."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates another pastime of Haridas Thakur, where he is invited to a gathering and discusses the glories of the holy name, emphasizing that the true result of chanting is ecstatic love for Krishna.

There is one more pastime in Chaitanya Charitamrita. Haridas Thakur walked until he came to the village of Chandapura, later known as Krishnapura, where he stayed at Balaram Acharya's house. Balaram Acharya was the family priest of Hiranya and Govardhana Majumda. Due to receiving his favour, Balaram Acharya was very attached to Haridas Thakur, and thus, he provided all his needs with great care and attention. Haridas Thakur was given a cottage in a secluded place and he came daily to Balaram Acharya's house to accept prasad. At that time, Raghunath Das was a schoolboy and he used to come and see Haridas Thakur every day. Naturally, Haridas Thakur was very merciful towards him, and as a result, Raghunath Das later on attained to his love. Haridas Thakur was immediately sheltered at the lotus feet of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Regular discourses were held at the residence of Hiranya and Govardhana. One day, Balaram Acharya very humbly invited Haridas Thakur to come there. Upon seeing Haridas Thakur arrive, the two Majumdaras immediately stood up and then fell at his lotus feet to offer obeisances. There were many learned scholars, brahmanas and respectable gentlemen in that assembly, and Hiranya and Govardhana were also greatly learned. As the two brothers very respectfully offered Haridas Thakur a sitting place, everyone began to speak about his exalted qualities as if they each possessed five mouths. Hiranya and Govardhana were very pleased to hear this talk. When it was mentioned how Haridas Thakur chanted 300,000 holy names daily, the learned scholars began to discuss the glories of the holy name of the Lord. Some of them said, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one is freed from all reactions to sinful activities. Others said, simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one becomes liberated from material bondage. Haridas Thakur protested. These two benedictions are not the true result of chanting the holy name of the Lord. If one actually chants the holy name without offences, his ecstatic love for the lotus feet of Lord Krishna is awakened.

**Key Quote:** "Liberation is thus the insignificant result derived from a mere glimpse of awakening of offenceless chanting."
**Summary:** Haridas Thakur explains the meaning of a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing that liberation is a byproduct of chanting the holy name without offenses, and that pure devotees desire ecstatic love for Krishna, not liberation.

In Srimad Bhagavatam, it is said, when a person is actually advanced and takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord, who is very dear to him, he becomes agitated, and thus sometimes laughs, sometimes cries, and sometimes chants loudly and dances without caring for outsiders. Liberation and the destruction of sinful reactions are two concomitant byproducts of chanting the holy name of the Lord. As the rising sun immediately dissipates all the world's darkness, so the holy name of the Lord, even if chanted only once without offences, dispels all of one's sinful reactions. Haridas Thakur questioned, O learned scholars, please explain the meaning of this verse. However, the audience responded, it would be better if you explain the meaning of this important verse. Haridas Thakur said, even before the sun rises in the morning, it dissipates the darkness of night with its dawning light, and thus all fear of thieves and ghosts immediately vanishes. Then, when the sun actually becomes visible, everything is clearly manifest and people begin performing their morning religious activities and other duties. Similarly, the first glimpse of offenceless chanting of the Lord's holy name immediately dissipates all reactions to sinful life. Then, when one is actually on the platform of offenceless chanting, there awakens a static loving devotional service to the lotus feet of Krishna. Liberation is thus the insignificant result derived from a mere glimpse of awakening of offenceless chanting. An example of such an effect of Nama Bhasa is seen in the life of Ajamila. Liberation, which is unacceptable to a pure devotee, is very easily offered by Lord Krishna.

**Summary:** The story continues with Gopal Chakravarti criticizing Haridas Thakur's statements about liberation through chanting, leading to a challenge and eventual dismissal from service.

There was a person named Gopal Chakravarti staying at Hiranya and Govardhana's house. He was the chief tax collector, and it was his duty to collect 12 lakh coins and deposit them in the emperor's treasury. This caste brahmana had very handsome bodily features, and he was very learned and youthful. However, he could not tolerate hearing the statement that one can achieve liberation by glimpsing the awakening of pure chanting of the Lord's holy name. Becoming very angry, Gopal Chakravarti began criticizing Haridas Thakur as follows. O learned scholars, just hear the conclusion of this emotional devotee. After many millions of births, when one becomes complete in transcendental knowledge, one may still not attain liberation. Yet, this man says that it can be obtained simply by awakening a glimpse of the holy name of the Lord. Haridas Thakur replied, Why are you doubtful? Shastra clearly states that one can attain liberation simply by a slight glimpse of offenseless chanting. For the devotee who enjoys the transcendental bliss of devotional service, liberation is most insignificant, like the water containing within the hoof print of a calf. Gopal Chakravarti said, If one is not liberated by such namabasa chanting, then I shall certainly cut off your nose. Haridas Thakur accepted this challenge by saying, If by namabasa liberation is not available, then I shall certainly cut off my own nose. After hearing Gopal Chakravarti's challenge, everyone gathered there became very agitated, and while getting up from their seats, they made a tumultuous noise. Hiranya and Govardhana immediately went and began chastising Gopal Chakravarti, and Balram Acharya told him, You are a foolish logician. What do you know about the devotional service of the Lord? Since you have insulted Haridas Thakur, you have put yourself in a very dangerous position and so you should not expect anything auspicious. The two Majumdaras immediately dismissed Gopal Chakravarti from their service. Then, as Haridas Thakur got up to leave, they went along with the other members of the assembly and fell at his lotus feet. While smiling, Haridas Thakur spoke to them as follows in a very sweet voice, None of you are at fault. Indeed, even this ignorant so-called brahmana is not to be blamed, for he is accustomed to dry speculation and logic. One cannot understand the glories of the holy name of the Lord simply by mundane logic and argument.

**Summary:** The story concludes with Gopal Chakravarti contracting leprosy as a consequence of his offense to Haridas Thakur, highlighting the devotee's forgiveness and the Lord's intolerance of blasphemy towards his devotees.

Now, all of you please return home and do not be sorry that I have been insulted. May Lord Krishna bestow his blessings upon you all. After returning home, Hiranya and Govardhana ordered that Gopal Chakravarti never again be admitted into their house. Within three days, Gopal Chakravarti was attacked by a leprosy, and as a result, his highly raised nose melted away and fell off. Although his toes and fingers were as beautiful as golden champaka buds, they gradually withered away, and upon seeing Gopal Chakravarti's condition, everyone became highly astonished. While considering the wonderful influence of Haridas Thakur, everyone glorified him and offered him obeisances. Although Haridas Thakur did not take the brahmana's offences seriously, the Supreme Personality of God could not tolerate it and thus arranged for him to suffer the consequences. It is a characteristic of a pure devotee that he excuses any offences committed by an ignorant rascal. However, the characteristics of Lord Krishna is that he cannot tolerate blasphemy of his devotees. Haridas Thakur was unhappy to hear about how Gopal Chakravarti had been attacked by leprosy. After informing Balram Acharya, Haridas Thakur went to Advaita Acharya's house at Shantipur.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of being qualified to associate with pure devotees and maintaining appropriate relationships with senior, equal, and junior devotees.

Shri Haridas Thakur Ki! So, this is the glory of great devotees like Haridas Thakur. Great devotees are like razor blades. They can save your life by a good surgery, but if we are not careful, we can get cut. So, it is said that we always, first before praying for the association of pure devotees, we first pray that we are qualified to associate with the pure devotees. If we are qualified to associate with pure devotees, then we can act in an appropriate way in front of a pure devotee. So, what does it speak of dealing with the Supreme Lord? So, this material life, Sadhu Sanga, is so important that we learn how we associate with devotees of three different stages, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said: devotees who are senior to us, devotees who are equal to us, and devotees who are junior to us. So, to all three levels, we need to have an appropriate relationship, a right way of dealing. We don't consider ourselves superior to the inferiors. Rather, we show mercy and teach them. To equals, we be very friendly, and together we serve the Supreme Lord. And towards the seniors, we humbly serve them.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of devotee association, avoiding offenses, and looking beyond the external appearances of Vaishnavas.

It doesn't matter who is leading, because going towards Krishna is more important. Whether we are leading or we are led, it really doesn't matter. So, whenever there is this situation of seniors, juniors and equals, we need a situation to deal with that. So, that is why Srila Prabhupada created this house full of devotees, different levels of devotees, devotees from different areas, different from all over the world. So, we may be knowingly or unknowingly committing so many offences. So, every morning we say, devotees don't take the offence directly. But when devotees are offended, the Lord, even though He does not take offence to Him seriously, He will take the offence to His devotees seriously. So, we know the story of Ambarisha Maharaj. The story is here. Haridas Thakur, lowly born or highly born, educated, not educated, beautiful, ugly, black, white, doesn't matter. So, we need to pray to the Supreme Lord and the devotees to go past the externals of Ambarisha. One has to cross, looking at the Vaishnavas materially. So, great lesson by the life of Haridas Thakur.

We are very fortunate to be here. It is said that if you chant Haridas Thakur's name, your liberation is guaranteed. So, what to speak of being in Haridas Thakur's birthplace, being in the bhajanskali of Haridas Thakur, and that too the association of Vaishnavas. So, this is a great, great opportunity. We cannot forget the basic foundational teachings of devotional service. So, Dham Seva is very important, just like Nama Seva, Murti Seva, Vaishnava Seva, Bhagavata Seva, Dham Seva. So, one has to, in the middle of many services and important roles we play in different places, it is always good to take some time off to visit Dhams with Vaishnavas. We can alone go two weeks, go around and come, but those two weeks, if we spend with Vaishnavas, the whole experience is totally different. So, we are coming here for Dham Seva. Not only Dham Seva, along with that Vaishnava Seva, and the greatest of Vaishnavas, Haridas Thakur.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of Diksha, explaining its components (Divya Gyan and Papakshaya) and its importance in the process of liberation and reviving Krishna Consciousness within the Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Parampara.

Hare Krishna and welcome to all the candidates for the first and the second initiation ceremony. As per the system given by Srila Prabhupada, as per his last wish, Diksha, how many are first initiation here? First initiation, right. So, Diksha, you may know already, comes from two words, sounds, Di and Ksha. Di represents Divya Gyan. And Ksha is Papakshaya. Two things which is primarily needed for returning home back to Krishna. All of you know that we are in a place which is unsuitable for us. Us meaning the spirit soul, not as the body, not as the mind, or not as the ego, what we have assumed. So, this is not the place for the living entities to be in, because he should be with Krishna. He should be associating with Krishna and his paraphernalia. But unfortunately, we are here in this material world. And the process of liberation has already started by us coming in touch with this Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Parampara.

**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the difference between theoretical knowledge (Gyan) and realized knowledge (Vijnana), emphasizing the need to move beyond superficial understanding and practice Krishna Consciousness to overcome Karma and engage in constitutional activities.

The most sacred, live, vibrant, practising Parampara in the Vaishnava system. So, having come here, this is an opportunity for us to revive the Krishna Consciousness, which is as a Swaroopa of the spirit soul. So, to go back to our original position, the two most important aspect is the Gyan, Divya Gyan. Knowledge about our original position. Gyan does not mean just material or theoretical understanding, superficial understanding. All of us know Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All of us have heard, we are not the body. All of us know we have to go back to him, but we are not able to go back to him. So, knowledge is there, but the Vijnana, the realised knowledge. Realising the knowledge by practice. Making the knowledge a reality. That is Divya Gyan. Realised knowledge. Ten Brahma Hridayat, like Brahma, realised. So, this realisation happens in the heart, not in the memory. So, this Divya Gyan is one of the components required to go back to the original position. But for that, the stopping, what is stopping us is the Karma, which is due to Papa. So, this building up of this Papa is there, which is stopping us from knowing the Jnana, which is stopping us from performing the original constitutional activities. Now, we are performing conditional activities. Those activities which we are made to do in this condition. Sometimes we are in human condition, we do human activities. We are in animal condition, you do animal activities. So, these are conditional activities. Even the activities we may do in Varna and Ashram are also conditional activities. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, Abramacharis, Sanyasis, these are all conditional. Constitutional activity, Nitya Seva. The constitutional activity is Krishna Consciousness. Krishna Consciousness, Bhakti, performance of devotional service to the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Diksha helps in developing Divya Gyan and burning Papa (sins) through the grace of the spiritual master, emphasizing the importance of surrender (Saranagati) and determination as prerequisites for Diksha.

So, that is the constitutional activity of the soul. And what is stopping that is our conditional situation, which is due to Papa. The covering of the soul, build up covering, subtle covering and the gross covering. So, by the process of proper Diksha, one is supposed to develop Divya Gyan, one is able to burn his Papa, all by the grace of the spiritual master, who is at the lotus feet of Krishna. So, taking shelter of such a spiritual master, taking shelter of this Acharya, who is dear to Krishna, who has come to us by good fortune and by the mercy of this personality. So, that is the opportunity we have in this decision you all have made by taking this determination. So, Diksha is a beginning process. It is not an end process. By Diksha, one gets opportunity for this purification. Yes, there are certain qualifications, qualifications needed. Some qualification needed to get Diksha. Just like if you want to be a doctor, you should have a pre-university degree. With your SSLC or a matriculation, you cannot enter a MBBS college. So, there is a pre-requirement of getting something to get into this college. So, this is like an admission, which guarantees that you will become a doctor. But by admission, you don't become a doctor. Similarly, by Diksha, you don't become pure. It is a pre-requisite to become pure. And for Diksha, there are also pre-requirements. So, having qualified for Diksha, which is what? Qualification of Diksha is the determination. Determination to follow. Determination to serve. Determination to give up. Determination to surrender.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Unless he considers himself as a devotee of my devotee. That is the process. That is the principle."
**Summary:** This segment delves deeper into the concept of Saranagati (full surrender), highlighting the need to give up personal requirements and dedicate oneself to satisfying the spiritual master's wishes, emphasizing that spiritual knowledge is under the control of a personality (Krishna) unlike material knowledge which is system-based.

Saranagati. So, then what is Saranagati? Full surrender. Irrespective of any personal needs, personal requirements, care for person. So, a devotee who is taking Diksha, who is desiring to go back to Godhead, who is desiring to serve the spiritual master, has to first understand that he is ready to give up his own requirements. Unless we are ready to give up our own requirements, we cannot surrender 100% to the spiritual master and 100% dedicate our life to satisfy his wishes. Why? Because the Supreme Lord has wished that anybody who comes back to him should come through his pure devotees. As Krishna has explained in Adi Purana, anybody who considers himself as my devotee, I don't consider him as a devotee, unless he considers himself as a devotee of my devotee. That is the process. That is the principle. So, to satisfy the devotee of the Supreme Lord, one surrenders to him. And it's a very personal philosophy. This is not a mechanical philosophy that okay, I studied five years in engineering college, I have to get a certificate if I pass. I have gone through five years of doctorate, I have to become doctorate. I have done my research, I have to get. But here I have done everything, read Bhagavatam ten thousand times, I may not get Krishna. That is the difference. Material knowledge and spiritual knowledge, because spiritual knowledge is under the control of a personality.

**Key Quote:** "In spiritual system, one cannot get Krishna without pleasing the servant of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the impersonal nature of material knowledge with the personal connection required in the spiritual system, emphasizing that pleasing the servant of Krishna through genuine surrender of mind, words, and actions is essential for attaining Krishna.

Material knowledge is a control of a system. You go through the system, it doesn't matter who you are. You are able to vomit everything that is in the book, you will get. But here, vomiting won't help. Here, proper personal connection with Krishna. You have a connection with professor or a dean, doesn't matter. He may say yes sir, and behind him he will say so many other things. It doesn't matter. It's not a personal connection. Even though in many of the tradition knowledge, personal connection is important. You take any of those Vaidika knowledge, Natya Shastra, or any of those things also, the blessing of the teacher, blessing of the guru, this is a system in the Vedic system, not in the modern system. But spiritual system is totally different. In spiritual system, one cannot get Krishna without pleasing the servant of Krishna. Now pleasing the servant of Krishna does not mean simply shaking your head in front of him. Yes, yes, yes. It is not a tongue service. It is a service. It is surrender of one's heart. So one has to Manasa Vacha Karvana, by one's mind, by one's words, and by one's action, have to surrender to the personality and not only surrender up to the personality, make sure that the personality is satisfied. That is a requirement to get Krishna. So there is a system, but there is a very, very deep personal connection. That personal connection makes us qualified

**Summary:** This segment discusses Krishna's independent will and how He is only attainable through His grace, emphasizing the need to accept Krishna as a 'transcendental autocrat' and highlighting the spiritual master's blessing as armor in the fight against Maya.

to be accepted by Krishna. As Prabhupada quotes from Upanishad, many times, what is that verse? Naaham Naaham labhyo pravachanena labhya Naayam atma pravachanena labhya Na medhaya bahudha suthena. I am not available. Even if you are a great intelligent person, you are a great orator, you are a great Vedic person, I am available only if I allow you to be. No? I allow myself to be available to you. So this is Krishna's demand. So he is called transcendental autocrat. And we are all against autocrats in this material world, right? Nobody likes autocrat. Everybody blames you, he is an autocrat. Krishna is an autocrat. Can you accept that? Yes. If we can accept Krishna is autocrat, and his wish goes, nothing but his wish, then we are ready. So this is a preparation to get that consciousness. Deeksha is a preparation to get that consciousness. Deeksha allows us to get that consciousness. Why? Because once we have the blessing of the spiritual master, then we are not fighting alone. The world is like a fight. Fighting against maya, fighting against the current. So if you are alone, it's difficult. We need to have equipments. We have to be properly armed when we are fighting, right? The same way, the arm, the armor, that's the blessing of the spiritual master.

**Summary:** Using the analogy of a girl wanting to marry a person but disliking his family, the speaker emphasizes the need to accept Krishna and His entire paraphernalia, highlighting surrender as accepting Krishna's interests and Diksha as the beginning of this learning process.

So a military kivgamesh said this last time, in the holy name of the Lord, the bhagavata, person bhagavata, and the philosophy bhagavatata, we are entering a very very personal arena, just like a girl wants to marry a person. I like you, I want to marry you. But I don't like your mother, I don't like your father, I don't like a dog, I don't like your house, I don't like. Impossible. he has to get out. But you cannot go to Krishna saying, Krishna, I like you but nothing around you. That is not possible. They're accepting the whole. We are not accepting one person because Krishna is that whole. You cannot say, I'll take Krishna but I don't like this, I don't like that. No. Block, stock and barrel you have to accept. So one has to understand that one is entering the whole. We are separated like the spark is separated from the fire. So today we are separated. Now we have to get into the whole which means Krishna and his paraphernalia. Krishna, his devotees, his places, his paraphernalia, his philosophy, his desires, his interest. We are part of him. Now we are disconnected so we think, I mean this is different Krishna's interest is different. So as part of surrender, one of the principal elements of surrender is to accept the interest of Krishna and keep our interest aside. There are six aspects of surrender. So keeping Krishna's interests. So this learning process starts with diksha. It's not an

world this ocean of material world so that begins with Diksha this qualifies us to be ready to go back to Krishna and gives us all that we lack not that he gives everything and we don't have to do anything no God helps those who help themselves some way same way the spiritual master helps those who help themselves how is that when we are dedicated when we are proactively dedicated and serving him then the strength to do that comes so this way the devotees the disciples are taken back to Krishna by the spiritual master to engage in our original position so it's a very very serious business now now I am very free in my life and I am ready to take Diksha no it's not a free time work it's a full-time work so we have to make sure that we give our time we give our energy these are the two things we can surrender to Krishna what does we have we have our time and we have our energy so brahmachari is in the temple give their time and their energy for the cause of the ashram which is the house of the spiritual master and there are the grahastha who stay outside the temple but they also give their time and energy whatever is left after taking care of their first duty so they have

**Key Quote:** "What makes us qualified surrendered soul is what quantum of time and energy we spend for the absolute cause."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the duties of Grihasthas, emphasizing the importance of proportionately dedicating their earnings and time to the spiritual master's cause, highlighting that true surrender is measured by the quantum of time and energy spent for the absolute cause, and Diksha is the beginning of this journey.

the license to take care of the first duty brahmachari is in the temple automatically they go back to godhead what about the me sitting in my house you also have the opportunity to go back to godhead by the same process the people living in the temple so doesn't matter whether one is staying in the temple or staying outside the temple both have the to go back to Godhead by following the process but one has to surrender, be ready to give his time and give his energy. So Grihasthas they earn money, they spend their time in earning money and they earn money whether it's an employment, whether it's a business and they have the duty for their ashram, the Grihastha ashram duties which includes immediate requirement, which includes emergency requirement. And he parts proportionately to his surrender the balance to the spiritual master's cause. That is a surrender and he keeps aside time enough to serve the spiritual master. So giving one's time and giving one's energy is a symptom of surrender, not taking Diksha, change name or you have a white thread that doesn't make us qualified as a qualified surrendered soul. What makes us qualified surrendered soul is what quantum of time and energy we spend for the absolute cause. So that all that begins with Diksha. And a person taking Diksha is determined to do these things. If anybody wants to think twice, this is the right time. When you go to war, they all assemble and say anybody who wants to come out of this war, this is the right time to decide. So same way, this is the right time to decide.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that taking Diksha is the most intelligent decision because it leads one from the 'drainage' of material life to the 'main road' of spiritual life, offering real bliss, happiness, and connection with Krishna and His devotees, contrasting it with the temporary and ultimately unsatisfying pursuits of the material world.

deities, we take a pledge to dedicate. But according to Prabhupada, this is the most intelligent decision one takes. The most intelligent decision. Why? When you come to know that I am walking through the drain and somebody says, this is drain, dirty place. You are walking through, this is the road. Having come to know the dirty road, he gets into the proper path. So now we are driving on the main road. Till now we were driving on the drainage. Most intelligent person. Why? He doesn't work like a donkey in this material world for material causes. So one has to balance his life, his material requirements and keep spiritual requirement as a priority and step by step, if you follow this process, Gropa is already guaranteed as shelter of Krishna. Why all these things? To get the ultimate shelter which gives us Satchitananda, the state of eternity, the state of shelter and permanent bliss, not material bliss, not temporary bliss. Permanent happiness. So if you want to experience the happiness of the soul, Atma Ramaha, self-sufficiently blissful soul, satisfied in himself, in service of the Supreme Lord. So that is the position we are trying to get. That is why it is called intelligent. Rather than in this material world, somehow or the other trying to get happy, despite of all the difficulties, crossed difficulties, and after all these things, the man thinks, he's a hero. I've made it in this material world. That is where Gropa says, this is like a camel chewing the thorn. Finally, he's only testing his blood. Same way the man who says he's successful in the material world is only testing his own blood without knowing. That is not intelligent. What is intelligent is understanding that I am in an unnecessary business and enter the real business, which gives real bliss, real happiness, real connection with our relations. All the relations in this material world, by the way, happen so. But the real relationship is with Krishna and the pure devotees. And that begins with diksha. Hence, it is called the most right decision. It is called the most intelligent decision. So thank you very much for taking this decision. So we will continue with the other process. Anybody has any questions? Anybody wants to go outside, talk to the wife and date, decide

So, it looks like this was a big temple once upon a time, a lot of dilapidated buildings. These are the work of the great preachers, like we said in the morning, the first set of preachers after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, three people, three personalities: Srinivas Acharya, Narottam Das Thakur, and Shyamananda Prabhu. These were the first three preachers with the Shakti of Gauranga. All of them were very sad that they were born just after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, they couldn't see Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, so they were the Shakti of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to initiate the preaching. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did a lot of preaching, but real organized preaching was done by these three personalities.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the tradition of deity installation, highlighting Narottam Das Thakur's role and contrasting how deities were received in the past versus the present.

And that is a footstep we are also following, the organized preaching form. The first temple was built by Narottam Das Thakur. The first Gopunima was done by him in Keturi ground. We'll see that, where Janava Mata himself, herself, and Nithyananda Prabhu's wife, she was present. So today also that is the same system we follow: go to your place, take a place, put, have the deities installed and start preaching. So this system is not something new, it is going on from Narottam Das Thakur's time onwards. They all went, installed duties, but the difference is that these personalities got deities and they dream, they got deities from Radharani. We have to make deities and then install them as Kali Yuga goes on.

Now the strength of the preachers are going down, but there's Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Shakti, so with all our weaknesses, He is making us to preach, continue preaching this message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. But these preachers were Shakti away by themselves, Shyamananda, Narottam, Srinivas. So Shyamananda Prabhu, as we read a little bit in the previous temple, same line as Nithyananda. So we are also Nithyananda, coming down from Janava Mata and Narottam Das Thakur, Vishwanath Chakravarti. So this is our line. However, as far as these are concerned, they are a little different, even though they are from Nithyananda Prabhu's Vamsha because of the tilak mark, right? There's a little different, but basically...

All the people said that he took reinitiation from Jeeva Goswami and Jeeva Goswami has changed his name from Dukhi Krishna to Shamananda. This whole kind of controversy erupted in Vandavan. So to solve this, his own Guru from Mayapur, from Ambika Kalna. From there, Gauridas Pandit's disciple Hridayachaitanya went all the way to Vandavan to settle this issue. But then finally, to make the story short, that it was proven that this Tilak was handed over by Radharani herself to Shamananda and he did not change anything. He considered Hridayachaitanya as his Guru, but Jeeva Goswami and Radharani did not change anything. He considered Hridayachaitanya as his Shiksa Guru for further preaching. So these great personalities went to Jeeva Goswami and Radharani who was a disciple of Lokannath, all went to Jeeva Goswami friend. for further preaching. So these great personalities all went to Jeeva Goswami friend. Narottam Dashtakul who was a disciple of Lokannath also went to Jeeva Goswami to learn.

Gopalabhadra Goswami. He also was given under the care of Jeeva Goswami. And Gopalabhadra Goswami had the guidance and guidance like I said. So I am a disciple and the Hadith was So, basically Jiva Goswami is the real authority on Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Prabhupada said Jiva Goswami is the authority, especially because of the shakshandarva he wrote conclusive truth about Krishna, Krishna is the Bhagavan Swayam. And then Baladeva Vidyabhushan, today morning you went to his birthplace. So these personalities actually fixed Gaudiya Vaishnavism as authorized parampara within the Madhya Gaudiya parampara. Especially the Ramanandis and the Ramanujacharyas, they were saying there is no authority to the Gaudiya Vaishnavism, where is your siddhanta coming from and where is your bhashya on the Brahma Sutras. Unless we have a bhashya on Brahma Sutras, we are not going to be able to understand Brahma Sutras. You are not considered an authorized line, because Sri Vaishnavas have their authorized bhashya, Madhya has their authorized bhashya. But what about Gaudiya Vaishnavism?

Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur was a great person. He had authority in those times, but he was very old, so he didn't go to Jaipur, he sent his disciple Baladeva, so Baladeva Vidyabhushan went there and he wrote this bhashya and called it Govinda Bhashya on the 500 sutras of Brahma Sutra. So Prabhupada Goswami, Sanatana Goswami, Jeeva Goswami, Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur, Baladeva Vidyabhushan. And these three preachers, they were the solid foundation for Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to create a big foundation for Gaudiya Vaishnavism.

Not long back, 500 years back, still way down 200, 200, 300 years back it got lost, then again Bhaktivinoda Thakur had to revive it. And then Bhaktivinoda Thakur had to establish another foundation with his 64 Gaudiya Maths. And then it was for our Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada to take it all over the world. Now Gaudiya Vaishnavism is like authority, people say, oh Janmashtami, the way ISKCON is doing, Abhishekam, the way ISKCON is doing, so ISKCON has become a kind of a, what do you call it, benchmark for Bhaktivinoda.

place and remember their sacrifices and we are taking it forward. All of us as preachers, we have our chota-chota jobs and our chota-chota deshas where we preach in different places. But there's a whole force behind that, there's a whole force behind this, there's a whole authority to books. There's a whole authority to conclusions and the whole tradition left by these people. So it's good that we take some time off and see all these places with the Vaishnavas to inspire ourselves and to charge ourselves and go and give it. The only difference is that these personalities we are preaching to people who are very simple. May not be very Vedic, what 50, 60, 100 or 200 years back or 300 years back, people were much more simple. But for us the challenge is we are preaching to hardcore, hardcore, we ourselves are hardcore materialists and we are preaching to hardcore materialists. So the difference is that. And they had the strength of Sanskrit and the strength of Vedic education. What do we have? We just parrot what Prabhupada said, that's it. But that voice of Prabhupada is so strong that it can change the world. Yes. It can change the hearts of thousands of people even though it is just going through our mouth. So we are just postman delivering the message of Prabhupada to the whole world. He is doing the preaching. So the great personality who is doing preaching now and continuing for next 10,000 years is Prabhupada.

## How Can I Overcome Envy Toward Specific Devotees? | Sri Jai Chaitanya Dasa

### envy, judgment, qualification

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So you are saying, you don't mind qualified people progressing, but you mind when unqualified people progress."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the question of why envy arises towards some devotees and not others, specifically focusing on the perception of who is 'qualified' to progress.

Hare Krishna, Prabhu Dhanwad Pranam. Prabhu, we see this feeling of enviousness is not for everybody. Suppose there are two devotees in ashram who are doing very nice things and they are achieving. So one devotee's nature is very good. He is submissive and humble and he treats everybody nicely. So when he is progressing, I feel good for him. I am not feeling enviousness. But on the other hand, some other devotees who are not respectful or who don't care for others, if he is progressing, then I feel kind of hatred or I would say jealousy. Why is it so that I am not having enviousness for everybody? Same. But for some particular kind of people only. So you are saying, you don't mind qualified people progressing. But you mind when unqualified people progress.

### karma, Krishna's sanction, judgment

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Whatever achievements they are getting, it is by sanction of Krishna and Prabhupada only."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that judging qualification based on external achievements is flawed, as both Krishna's sanction and karma play a role in a devotee's progress.

First of all, how do you classify qualified or unqualified? So you are saying that when unqualified people progress, I feel envious. How can unqualified people progress? Not possible. Whatever achievements they are getting, it is by sanction of Krishna and Prabhupada only. So what you are looking, what you are saying is, you are talking about the facilities he is getting or the position he is getting. You are measuring qualified or not qualified in terms of the visible positions, visible things he is getting. So that itself is wrong from our side because we don't actually, but it is sometimes common, we don't, we should not, by seeing what he is getting, we should not judge whether he is qualified or not qualified. Because karma provides, not Krishna. Right? If some devotee is getting something, he is not really qualified, but he has got something. Karma is also playing.

**Key Quote:** "So our measure of who is qualified, who is not qualified is totally wrong."
**Summary:** The speaker cautions against judging devotees based on external humility or achievements, as duplicity and the influence of maya can be deceptive.

But don't think that, oh, Krishna has given, Krishna has blessed him. Or sometimes you find externally a devotee very, very humble, crawling down. Humble so that he crawls down. Paka sadhana, pakka externals. Ah, he got a PhD. I feel happy. But it could be the reverse. Maybe he is a duplicitous person. Right? Where bhakti can be, drama is possible. Sometime in life, maya will hit him. Maya is not going to spare anybody. But maybe now maya is favoring him. He has got some facility. So our measure of who is qualified, who is not qualified is totally wrong. Could be wrong.

So the best thing is not to compare. Best thing is always feel that whether it is karma or not. Krishna has provided him. We always conclude that Krishna has provided him. My father has provided him. My father will provide me also whenever I am ready. My father has provided him. So when we identify the Supreme Lord as a father, and all other living beings as brothers and sisters,

**Key Quote:** "Don't feel consoled by mental justifications."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of finding consolation in spiritual philosophy (Shastra) rather than relying on mental justifications to deal with feelings of envy.

then the same father is providing for him, same father is providing for me too. So when we try to compare and analyze, so when we try to compare and analyze too much, we get in the wrong path. So it is not our position or our requirement just to console. You have to take spiritual philosophy as a consoling matter. Feel consoled by the Shastra. Don't feel consoled by mental justifications. And we should feel, what is Shastra saying? So by absorbing oneself in the philosophy, one should feel consoled.

**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges that mistakes can happen, encourages dependence on Krishna, and stresses the importance of being happy for others without justifying one's peace of mind through judgments.

Yeah, sometimes it may pain. Or maybe there was a mistake in the management also. Nobody is God. The management can also make mistake or this person should have got better, that person somehow got it. Nobody is God. Mistakes can happen. Depend on Krishna. So what you said is correct. Be happy for others. That's good. Be happy for others. That's a good qualification. But don't try to justify my happiness, my peace of mind, because of certain judgments I make. We should feel peaceful ourselves. We should feel full. What Shastras say.

Unless you are in divine consciousness, it is not possible. A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad actions.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Easy to change outside, then inside automatically follows outside."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by acting without seeking results, one can become fixed in consciousness, and that in spiritual life, changing external actions can lead to internal transformation.

And when you act in such a way where we are not looking for the result, you will slowly, slowly get, be fixed in consciousness. So the body is doing all sinful activities. Your mind will also be sinful. Other way round also. If the mind is always sinful, the body will also follow the mind. When there is acceptance, when the external body is acting, something is happening inside also. The ability to cross beyond dualities is happening inside. That is why we say external actions are important to change the insides. Many times we see psychologically, if you change the insides, you can change the outside. But in spiritual life, it's easy to change the outside, then the inside automatically follows the outside.

When the devotees started Sankirtana in the courtyard of Lord Gauranga's temple, Devi Dasa, Gauranga, Gokula, Govinda Kaviraj and others soon forgot their external identities and began to roll on the ground. They rolled like lions and soaked the ground with their tears.

Das Thakura. The Samadhi of Ganga Narayan Chakravarti is in Vrindavan, Radha Gokul and the temple. Next, Bada Govinda Bari, the Golden Gauranga Deity. At Bada Govinda Bari Temple, rests today the enchanting Golden Gauranga Deity, that was once worshipped by Narottam Das Thakura.

He was a Brahmin. His name was Vipra Dasa. Mahaprabhu revealed to Narottam Das Thakura in his dream one night that his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deities were presently resting at the house of this Brahmana. These Deities lay hidden in his huge container of paddy. When Mahaprabhu left Bengal for Puri, after accepting his sannyas initiation, he manifested these enchanting Deities and hid them inside his paddy. In the course of time, they landed up in the house of this Brahmana. But this Brahmana was completely unaware of this. So when Narottam Das Thakur arrived at the house of this Brahmana the next day and wanted to look into his huge mount of paddy, the Brahmana warned him that a huge venomous snake lived in it, and it was not safe to go near it. Regardless, Shri Narottama entered the paddy container. He was very happy. He entered the paddy container, and immediately the huge snake appeared and walked out of the mount. All present were very filled with wonder. Soon Thakura Mahasaya discovered his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deities from the paddy and grabbed them dearly. The onlookers began loudly glorifying Narottam Das and shouted, Haribol! Haribol! Haribol! Haribol! Wherever Narottam Das Thakur went, he carried his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deity to the mountain. Haribol! Haribol! Haribol! He took his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deity and took him along with him. Narottam Das was mad in ecstasy love, ecstatic love with his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deity.

**Key Quote:** "Shravanam process can immediately awaken Krishna Prema within our hearts"
**Summary:** Lord Chaitanya led a civil disobedience movement against Chand Kazi, debated with him, and transformed his heart through Shravanam, highlighting the power of hearing to awaken Krishna Prema.

Nadia district, where Navadvip is located, was under the jurisdiction of Chand Kazi, who worked under Nawab Hussain Shah. Under the Kazi's order, his soldiers disrupted Sankirtana, congregational chanting of the Lord's holy names, on the streets of Navadvip. Interestingly, Lord Chaitanya then conducted the very first civil disobedience movement, attended by thousands of devotees, to protest the order of the Kazi and the actions of his soldiers. By seeing that big gathering, Chand Kazi got scared and he hid in the home. Somehow, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu convinced Chand Kazi to come out and had a debate with him and transformed his heart. In this way, Chand Kazi became a great Vaishnava. It is because it is a result of hearing from Lord Chaitanya. Shravanam, the process of Shravanam, is so powerful. Krishna Raj Kaviraj Goswami says this Shravanam process can immediately awaken Krishna Prema.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the extreme mercy of the Lord, using the example of Putana, and emphasizes that even a small act of devotion is recognized and rewarded by Krishna.

So, we read from Srimad Bhagavatam, 3rd Canto, Chapter 2, Text 23. The matter of remembrance of Lord Krishna. Translation. Purport. Here is an example of the extreme mercy of Lord, even to his enemy. It is said that a noble man accepts the good qualities of a person of doubtful character, just as one accepts nectar from a stalk of poison. In his babyhood, he was administered deadly poison by Putana, a Shri demon who tried to kill the wonderful baby. And because she was a demon, it was impossible for her to know that the Supreme Lord, even though playing the part of a baby, was no one else than the same Supreme Person. His value as the Supreme Lord did not diminish upon his becoming a baby to please his devotee, Yashoda. The Lord may assume the form of a baby or a shape other than that of a human being, but it doesn't make the slightest difference. He is always the same Supreme. A living creature, however powerful he may become, by dint of severe penance, can never become equal to the Supreme Lord. accepted the motherhood of Putana because she pretended to be an affectionate mother allowing Krishna to suck her breast. The Lord accepts the least qualification of the living entity and awards him the highest reward. That is a standard of his character. Therefore, who but the Lord can be the ultimate

**Key Quote:** "The Lord does not take our limitations, but the Lord does consider offenses done to another Vaishnava."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of associating with devotees (sadhu sangha), avoiding offenses to Vaishnavas, and the significance of surrendering to the Lord through dedication and austerity, particularly in the context of the parikrama.

shelter. Spiritual life done alone, parikrama done alone, these are all not as powerful as doing it in the company of a shavas, so sadhu sangha, that is the most important thing. And as Bhakti we know said, he decides to do this along with the Sangha of maestro. So we are very fortunate that we get this opportunity to do this, and we pray that we do this parikrama with the least dhamma parath, the least ways from a parath, the least mama parath. We are all coming to light, conditioned souls. So there are chances that we think differently. So we pray that we don't offend the Dham, the Vaishnavas, we go with. The Lord accepts Putana, demoness, because she had that few minutes of affection, at least to show affection. And the Lord has granted her such a high position as his mother. So the Lord does not take our limitations, but the Lord does consider offenses done to another Vaishnava. Offenses done because that shows that we don't recognize his creation, all the living entities. So keeping away from these offenses, respectful to all the Vaishnavas, doing Sankirtan is very important. The Lord will recognize, even though we have limitations, he will recognize that moments of surrender we do to him. So this act of 20 days dedicating to him itself is a surrender. Keeping aside so many things, so many important work would be there, but we keep that aside. So many family responsibilities are there, so many business responsibilities are there. We keep them all aside, and we come and dedicate. That is such a big surrender. The Lord will do that, recognizes these things and the difficulties we may go through, the difficulties to catch up with the team, right, to be together. So all these are different surrender, different different austerities of the mind, austerities of the body. So it's an opportunity to do all these things. So the Lord

will recognize that. So here this verse is also apt. With all the limitations, Putana gets a high position. So imagine a small endeavor from our side, how much the Lord would provide, how much the Lord would give credit. Ultimately that is the most important thing, irrespective of what we do, what service we do, what positions we have, what ashram we are in, what order of life we are in, that dedication we have for the Supreme Lord is what all that matters, right? So let us do this sankalpa and continue this parikrama. And this verse is uh very much connected to our parikrama also. This verse was one of the verses which inspired Pundarika Vidyanidhi, whose place we will be visiting, which will be the last of the parikrama in Chattogram. And he shifted from here to Navadvip to take company of the Supreme Lord. And he in Krishna lila, he is considered as Radharani's father, Vishwa Bhanu, king and elderly, very rich, very opulent, very uh what do you call a charming personality with a lot of servants, a lot of perfumes, a lot of

wealth. So Gadadhar Pandit had a tinge of doubt, you see a devotee at all, right, who was walking such opulent way. But then who is that Govinda Mukunda who took Gadadhara to Pundarika Vidyanidhi to meet a great devotee. So Gadadhar Pandit saw his house so opulent and he is chewing pan, always red mouth, big couch sitting there. But then I think it is Mukunda who sang this verse. The moment this verse was chanted, Pundarika went into the rapture of of ecstasy and he was like mad man. So seeing that he could understand what a great personality he is. Just by hearing this mercy of the Supreme Lord to Putana, he has gone into this ecstatic position. He kind of threw everything, broke everything in that room. Nobody could control him. He was so mad in love of Krishna. So that is why Gadadhar said, I offended him, now I should take shelter of him, I should take and he took initiation from Pundarika Vidyanidhi and he took initiation from Pundarika Vidyanidhi. So Gadadhar Pandita, an expansion of Radharani, Pundarika, an expansion of Vishwabanna. So they connect, they get connected in Gaur Lila in that form, right? So it's an important verse

He was envious of Vaishnavas and a great atheist. He found it difficult to tolerate that Haridas Thakur was being offered such respect. Thus, he began plotting ways and means to defame and dishonour Srila Haridas. Being unable to find any fault, he started practicing dharma. He refused to do any good to anyone. With him, he conspired with the prostitute and asked them to lure Haridas and deviate him from his vow of austerity. Among those prostitutes, one young and very attractive girl named Hira Bai was selected. Hira was very confident and assured Ramachandra Khan that she would be able to accomplish her job within three days. Ramachandra wanted to send a constable with Hira so that he could arrest Haridas as soon as he would try to get anywhere close to the girl. However, Hira Bai wanted to get intimate with Haridas Chakur at least once before Haridas was arrested. So, she requested Ramachandra Khan to send a constable when she would unite with Haridas for the second time. So, as planned, Hira Bai approached the cottage of Haridas Chakur in the middle of the night. She dressed herself very well and stood there exposing a part of her body to his view. She flattered Haridas Chakur, saying how beautiful he looked and how desperate she was to enjoy him. She explained that it would not be possible for her to continue living if she does not get to unite with Srila Haridas. Tumara Sangam Alagi Lubdhamo Ramana Tumana Paile Pranana Yaya Dharana Chaitanya Chaita Amrita Antya 3.11.3. Haridas Chakur listened to the girl carefully and assured that he would definitely accept her. However, he requested her to wait until he had finished chanting his spiritual number of rounds. He said that he would fulfill her desires after that. So, Hira sat there and waited for Haridas to finish his chanting. When the light of the morning appeared, Hira stood up and left disappointed.

Many stalwart Vaishnavas came to take her darshan and seek her blessings. Hirabai came to be subsequently known as Lakshahira as she chanted lakhs of holy names daily. Sri Lakshahira Devi Ki Rai Rai. In course of time, Ramachandra Kanth received the results of offending Vaishnavas, especially that of offending an exalted devotee like Haridas Thakur. When Lord Nityananda returned to Bengal to preach Bhakti, he began touring all over the country. Thus, it so happened that he, along with his followers, once visited Benapur and rested at the Durga Mantapa of Ramachandra Kanth. Ramachandra Kanth objected to this and sent his servant to convey the message that the devotees should select a different place for their stay. Lord Nityananda, on hearing this, became very angry and started laughing out loudly. He exclaimed that Ramachandra Kanth had rightly spoken that the place was unfit for the devotees to take rest. Instead, it was only fit for cow-killing meat eaters. Saying this, Lord Nityananda along with his followers left the village. A demon might make a great show of religiosity by conducting Durga Puja festivals or occasions like that. Yet, he can be easily identified by the way he treats other devotees or by the degree of his enviousness. Repeatedly committing Vaishnava Pradha, Ramachandra Khan was in no position to realize that Nityananda Prabhu was none other than Lord Balarama.

## Sri Balaram Jayanti Festival Discourse 2025 | His Grace Jai Chaitanya Dasa

### Balarama's importance, Krishna's enjoyment, Spiritual purification

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Unless he comes and purifies, Krishna cannot come there."
**Summary:** This segment introduces Balarama as the elder brother of Krishna, the first expansion of the Lord, and emphasizes his role in purifying the environment and the devotee's heart to make way for Krishna's presence.

Welcome to all of you on this occasion of Balaram Purnima, Balaram Jayanti. Balaram Jayanti comes always before Krishna Jayanti, and Balaram appeared as the elder brother of Krishna, elder brother of God. Then the elder brother should be the God. But no, our God is Krishna, the Supreme Personality of God. Sarvakarana Karanam. He is Raso Vaisaha. He is full of Rasa. His existence is full of Rasa, interactive enjoyment. Purpose of life is enjoyment, but we do not know how to enjoy because we try to catch all diaramas for enjoyment, and diaramas don't give enjoyment. Only real life gives enjoyment. So in the spiritual world, there is only enjoyment, Satchik, Ananda, eternity, knowledge, and bliss. This is the existence in the spiritual world. So to this material world, the Supreme Lord comes in different, different forms. In Goloka Vrindavan, where Krishna, the Supreme Lord, is always enjoying, He has his brother, elder brother, because he wanted an elder brother. Because he wanted an elder brother, who can become his elder brother? He wanted a friend. Who can be his friend? Only he himself can. So, the first expansion, the first incarnation in one sense, the first expansion is Balaram, Baladeva. So whenever a person says, Balaram is the true God of Liberation. So whenever Krishna appears, before that Balarama appears. Just like in the womb of Devaki also, Balarama appeared first, just before Krishna. However, it was considered as a miscarriage. Why? Because he was attracted by the womb of Rohini. Hence, Sankarsana, he took birth as Rohini Nandan rather than Devaki Nandan. Krishna is Devaki Nandan, Krishna is Ashodan Nandan. Balarama is Rohini Nandan, another wife of Vasudeva. But he appears. Why does he appear? Because unless he comes and purifies, Krishna cannot come there. Only when Balarama comes and purifies, then the seat is worth to invite Krishna. So, even in our heart, unless Balarama appears first, Krishna cannot come. And in Chaitanya Leela, Krishna appeared as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Balarama appeared as Nithyananda Prabhu. So, if you want to get the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, we have to get the mercy of Nithyananda, who is Balarama. All the paraphernalia we use to worship Krishna is Balarama. All the pots, all the aarati, all the items we use to worship Krishna, because no material things can be used to worship Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Only Balarama can spiritualize things."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on Balarama's role in spiritualizing material objects for Krishna's worship, identifies him as the original Guru (Adiguru), and explains that Balarama provides the spiritual strength (Bala) needed to attain Krishna.

God cannot accept anything material. He can only accept anything spiritual, and only Balarama can spiritualize things. So, Pujaris, before they worship, they spiritualize everything with the Pancharatra mantras and come to the level of Krishna's spirituality to worship him with all the spiritual things, which represents Balarama. His bedding is Balarama. His pillow is Balarama. Burdanga is Balarama. Kartal is Balarama. So, for a devotee, everything is to be respectfully used. The asana, the vigraha, all the asanas you make for the Supreme Lord, the altar you make for the Supreme Lord, that is also Sankarsana. So, the Lord, Lord Vishnu only sleeps on Sankarsana. You can provide him any pillow, goose chest pillow, he will not accept. He will only lie down on Sankarsana. So, Sankarsana, Balarama, is the most important personality in all of our spiritual life because with his blessing, with his mercy, we can get Krishna. We can know Krishna. So, the person who takes us to Krishna, that is Guru. Hence, Balarama is Adiguru Nithyananda. He is Adiguru. Unless we get the blessing of Guru, Shri Guru, we cannot get the Supreme Lord. So, and Guru, what is Guru? Guru is a mercy incarnation of the Supreme Lord. Hence, Balarama is a merciful incarnation of Krishna who shows the way. So, Balarama also gives Bala, not bodybuilding Bala, but spiritual Bala, because we need spiritual Bala to get Krishna, not physical Bala. Physical Bala will help you to do Krishna Seva better, but won't give Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Balarama, the elder brother, his only wish is to satisfy Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment describes Balarama's unwavering desire to satisfy Krishna, even in complex situations like the Mahabharata, and highlights Krishna's pleasure in being addressed in relation to his devotees, emphasizing the importance of personal relationships with the Lord.

That Bala comes from Balarama. So, in Vrindavan, Krishna and Balarama, even though Balarama is elder to Krishna, he will only say yes to Krishna, anything he wants. In the house, if our elder brothers stay like this, we will not be able to get Krishna. If our elder brothers stay like this, how good it could have been. But elder brothers are not like that. But Balarama, the elder brother, his only wish is to satisfy Krishna, because he was also put into confusion at the time of Mahabharata Yuta, which side will Krishna have into Pandavas. I like Duryodhana, but I can't fight against Krishna. So, he went for Tirta Yatra. So, he never does anything against the Vishnu of Krishna. In Dwaraka, he protects Dwaraka. He and him and Krita Verma, under him, the entire Narayaniya, Vanakshahuni soldiers, army of Balarama. The entire army was given to Kauravas, under Krita Verma. That's all the complexities of warfare. But Balarama always wants the satisfaction of his younger brother. And Krishna also does not like to be called Krishna. See Krishna, not very happy. You call him Balabhadra Anuja, he is very happy. Krishna Purvaja, that is Balarama. You call him Partha Sarathi, he is happy. You call him Rukmini, Rukripyatma, he is happy. You call him Devaki Nandan, he is happy. Krishna is happy. So, the Lord always wants to associate with the relationship, and that is our Swaroopa, relationship with the Lord. It is not that God is a big boss and we are all servants like in the material world, no. Yes, we are servants, but we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. And as a part of Him, we too enjoy in His association. Just like the spark is always full of bliss. When the spark is in the fire, as soon as the spark gets out of the fire, it dies away. In the same way, we, the spiritual spark, Amsha of the Supreme Lord Krishna, we too are satisfied only when that connection with Krishna comes back.

**Key Quote:** "Balarama's mercy is most important."
**Summary:** This segment underscores Balarama's significance in the Vaishnava tradition, stating that his mercy is essential for spiritual purification and attaining Krishna's grace, and connects Balarama to the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, explaining that 'Rama' represents both strength and pleasure potency.

And that connection with Krishna, if we want, then Balarama. That is the very most important personality. Hence, in the Bhagavata Sampradaya, Gaudiya Sampradaya, the Vaishnava Sampradaya, which we follow, Balarama is very important, more important than Krishna. Just like Guru is more important than the Lord. So Balarama's mercy is most important, and He always sees that only those purified souls get relationship with the Supreme Lord. So for our spiritual purification, He plays a very important role. In the Hare Krishna Mahamantra also, there are three levels of chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. The second level is Krishna and Balarama. Sopa says Balarama provides the strength, and not only strength, Rama also means pleasure potency. So the spiritual pleasure, spiritual bliss, spiritual strength is given by Balarama. Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Rama. And the final stage is Radha Krishna. Rama means Radha Krishna. Jubala Jodi. So he plays a very important role in the purification of the spirit soul in receiving Krishna's mercy. That is the final goal, to receive Krishna. That is not possible unless Balarama is satisfied.

**Key Quote:** "He has to create Sankarsana Consciousness."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Balarama expands in different forms and emphasizes the need to develop Sankarsana Consciousness (spiritual consciousness) to invite the Lord into our hearts, highlighting the crucial roles of Guru, Krishna, and Vaishnavas in spiritual life.

So in the material world, He expands in different forms. He expands as Ananda Sesha in the coastal ocean. Ananda Sesha as Garbhodaka ocean. Ananda Sesha in the Svetadvipa. The same way, if the Lord has to come in our heart, He has to create Sankarsana Consciousness. And what is Sankarsana Consciousness? Nothing but absolute spiritual consciousness, Akhanda Brahman. So with spiritual knowledge, the equality, spiritual equality that comes in a Sadaka before Sri Sri Radha Krishna appears in his heart. So Balarama, as we know, in Vrindavan, in Dwaraka, everywhere, he has taken this subservient role to the Supreme Personality of God. So Krishna, this Krishna Consciousness movement is a movement which is very very personal and very very relationship oriented. Hence, for us, Guru, Krishna, Vaishnavas, they all become very important part in our spiritual life.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual knowledge comes from Seva, purifying the senses by doing Seva."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that spiritual knowledge is attained through selfless service (Seva), which purifies the senses and mind, and highlights the importance of temples as spiritual hubs created by Prabhupada for purification and connection with the Supreme Lord.

Vaishnavas play a very important role because Guru, Sri Guru appears, instructs the disciple in different ways. It is not that one overnight we get spiritual knowledge. Spiritual knowledge comes from Seva, purifying the senses by doing Seva. That is why Krishna Seva is given so much importance. Rishikena, Rishikesha, Saivana, Bhakti Rucha. Rishikena, Rishikesha, Rishikesha, is Supreme Lord Krishna. Rishika is the senses. So when the senses are utilized in serving the Supreme Lord, Rishikesha, then the senses get purified. When the senses get purified, mind gets purified. Intelligence gets purified. The entire existence becomes purified. In that purified existence, chanting Hare Krishna, that makes a connection with the Supreme Lord. It's always Seva. That is why Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, our Acharya, made these temples of all over the world. He said these are the places, these are all spiritual hubs where you can come and purify. So purification happens in this place. So that is why here in, near Ananagar, he opened this branch. Small place, but any Seva done here with pure mind reaches the Supreme, Goloka Vrindavan. There is no difference between where it is. You may have some, you may have some inconveniences here, but if you do Seva humbly to satisfy Guru and Krishna, it reaches. And Balaram notices that.

**Key Quote:** "This is not a good place to be in."
**Summary:** This segment explains the need for liberation from the material world, describing it as a place of suffering (Dukhalayam), and uses the analogy of a meat-eater to illustrate how negative experiences are necessary to understand the true nature of material enjoyment.

When Balaram notices that, he gives. So, Balaram, represented here by the spiritual master, they are all watching because the whole idea of spiritual master, Balaram, is to see that the living entities get liberation from this material world. Why should we get liberated from the material world? Because this is not a good place to be in. If you want to know this is not a good place to be in, you should have some negative experiences in this material world. Otherwise, you think this material world is very nice. Like, there is a story. The Western world. Tell a meat eater, Westerner who is meat eater, all kinds of sin he does. He says, don't do sin. Why? I feel good doing all these things. Smoking, meat eating, humanizing, intoxicating. I know good. I feel this enjoyment. No, you will go to hell. No, my family, everybody does this. All of them will go to hell. Oh, then hell is a good place. I will go to hell. All my family members are there. So, if you do not know what is good and what is bad, you will think this is the right enjoyment, but this is not the right enjoyment. We can hear from the Shastras that Krishna himself declares Dukhalayam Asasratam. Don't try to be happy in this world. This is Dukhalayam.

**Key Quote:** "Material world cannot give you permanent happiness."
**Summary:** This segment discusses different levels of intelligence in recognizing the suffering inherent in the material world, emphasizing that true happiness cannot be found in temporary material possessions and that purification is necessary to free the soul.

This is the place of Dukha. We may hear, we will not understand. So, we commit some activities in the material world and face Dukha. Or then we say, oh, this is Dukha. Some people, even after experiencing Dukha, will continue like a camel eating their thorn, tasting the blood. So, sometimes people like to taste their own blood without knowing. So, this is called third-class intelligence. You taste this dirty world as good. Second-class intelligence means that you know what is good and what is bad. So, you know what is good and what is bad. So, second-class intelligence is when you get a beating, this place is not good. Let us go back and see what is good. And first-class intelligence is when you hear from the spiritual master, when you hear from the sastras, you already experience yes, material world is not good. Why? Because material world cannot give you permanent happiness, and we all want happiness. Everybody wants a house. Everybody wants a job. Everybody wants a job. Everybody wants a vehicle. Everybody wants a fridge. Everybody wants a TV. Everybody wants a flat. Why? To be happy. But are you happy? No. Why? Because once you get one thing, then there are ten problems connected to that. I want mobile phone, iPhone, earphone, Apple phone, orange phone. But no connectivity. Your house is in a guha. There is no connection. What is this? So, for every desire, there are ten obstructions in this material world. How much can we enjoy with our senses? How much can you eat? So, there is limitation in this material world, but the soul is unlimited. The soul is not to be limited by all these temporary things. So, to free the soul, layer by layer, we need to purify

ourselves, come to the level of Krishna Consciousness where the real bliss comes within the heart. So, this is why these temples are made all over the world, where you all can come, come together and do seva, satisfy the Lord and purify ourselves, and gradually, gradually, gradually, come to the conclusion that Krishna, Krishna is to Bhagawan Swayam. As Bhagavatam says, Krishna is to Bhagawan Swayam. In South India, most popular is Vishnu is considered as the Supreme Bhagawan, right? All the incarnations come through Vishnu in this material world. But in Bhagavatam, it is said, and all the South Indians read Bhagavatam. Why? People think that only Aishwarya that is the position of the Supreme Lord. No. The position of the Supreme Lord is also Aishwarya, very official.

official. If you want to know a person, is official identity enough? No. That is only one part of that of friendship. Like Arjuna had. Dasi has one thing and there is friendship. You know the person more than his friend, but you will not know him as much as his wife knows him. So, the parakhya rasa, the madhurya rasa, that is the parakhya rasa. It is only one part of the parakhya . This is the Parakhya rasa. The parakhya is the true one of the parakhya . So, now it is To achieve him, to get him, we need the mercy of Balarama. So Balarama, Purnima, the appearance of Balarama is very, very, very sacred, very, very important, even though public do not recognize, they recognize Janmashtami. But Baladeva, Balarama, Purnima is one of the very important functions. So we are here today celebrating that. May the Lord bless all of us to get his mercy, to go back to Supreme Lord Krishna.

Instead of going to Vrindavan, he showed the way towards Shantipur, which is Advaita Acharya's house. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was in ecstasy. He had no idea where he was going. He wanted to go to Vrindavan, but Nithyananda Prabhu brought him to Shantipur, Advaita Acharya's house. And Advaita Acharya called Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mother, Sachi Mata, because now he has become a mendicant, he has become a Sanyasi. He will go away to Vrindavan or other places. Mother will not be able to see Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Already the mother is in great pain. So, Advaita Acharya brought Sachi Mata to Shantipur so Chaitanya Mahaprabhu could meet her. So, one request Sachi Mata had was that he doesn't go to Vrindavan, that he make his headquarters in Jagannath Puri, because in Jagannath Puri and Calcutta, devotees always come and go. So, she said, "I will get some information about you. I will hear about you from people who come from Jagannath Puri. So, please make your residence in Jagannath Puri." So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu made his residence in Jagannath Puri.

So we will just read, I have one or two paragraphs about Hrishikananda. So Hrishikananda Prabhu, the disciple of Shamananda Prabhu. Sri Hrishikananda Prabhu was born in 1590 in the village of Rayani, in the Medinipura district. His father's name was Raja Achuthananda, a rich zamindar, and his mother, Bhavani Devi. Medinapur district used to be part of Orissa kingdom. Hrishikananda was also known by the name Hrishikamurari. Hrishikamurari meets Shamananda Prabhu. One day, Hrishikamurari was meditating in a solitary place. He was anxious to find a spiritual master who could give him spiritual direction. He had entered into a very deep meditation when he heard a disembodied voice say, "Murari, you need not be anxious any longer. Your guru is Shamananda Prabhu and you will meet him here very shortly. Take shelter of him and your life will be successful." Upon hearing this divine message, Murari began chanting the name of Shamananda on his beads with joyful enthusiasm. He spent the entire night crying out of his desire to meet his guru. At dawn, Hrishikamurari was on the lookout for his guru when he saw the tall figure of Shamananda approaching him, as effulgent as the sun, surrounded by his disciples. He started dancing and chanting the name of Lord Nityananda. Having waited anxiously for so long to encounter his guru, Hrishikamurari immediately fell at his feet. Shamananda affectionately lifted him up and embraced him and later initiated him with the Radha Krishna mantra.

With the spiritual powers invested in him by his guru, Hrishikamurari was able to convert many criminals, atheists, Muslims and other fallen spirit souls to the path of devotion, bestowing the jewel of Prema upon them all. On one occasion, a wicked Muslim tried to silence Hrishikamurari by having him attacked by an intoxicated elephant, but Hrishikamurari was able to transform even the elephant into a disciple and engage him in the service of Vishnu and the Vaishnavas.

**Summary:** This segment describes Advaita Acharya's birth name Kamalaksha, his mother's dream, his promise to bring the holy rivers to Lauda, and the creation of Paana Tirtha and Jadukatha river.

Waves of divine ecstasy flooded the people of Navahadevi. On the advice of learned astrologers, Shri Kubera Pandita and Navahadevi named their son Kamalaksha. Navahadevi once desired to take a dip in the holy Ganges. She saw a dream one night in which her son Kamalaksha revealed himself as four-handed Lord Vishnu. Beholding the Supreme Lord before her, she immediately offered her prayers in glorification. Shri Advaita assured his mother and vowed to summon all the holy rivers to Lauda, so that she does not have to travel to bathe in the Ganges. Upon waking up, Navahadevi seemed quite confused. Although she was initially reluctant to disclose her dream, Navahadevi finally revealed it to her son on his insistence. A seven-year-old Advaita then shone again and he would bring all the holy Tirthas to Lauda to fulfill the desires of his dear mother. Thereafter, during the night, Shri Advaita entered into a deep meditation and summoned the holy rivers. He then ordered them to reside at Lauda during the Madhu Krishna Trayodashi Tithi so that his mother can bathe in them. Accordingly, Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada, Kaveri, Saraswati, Udavari, etc. reached and gathered near the mountains of Lauda. The next morning, Advaita Acharya took his mother so that she could experience the wonder with her own eyes. As soon as Advaita chanted the names of the Supreme Lord and blew upon his conch shell, the holy rivers started pouring down from the mountains. Some of them were reddish, some were bluish, some were white, while some were yellow. Shri Kamalaksha introduced each of the rivers to his mother. This exalted dham came to be subsequently known as Paana Tirtha as it was Advaita Acharya's vow, Paana in Bengali means vow, that had caused the holy river to descend to this place. This newly created water body came to be known as Jadukatha river as it was shaped by Advaita's magic.

On the bank of this Jadukatha river stands a beautiful temple renowned as Advaita Mahari. The occasion of Kali Puja was celebrated with great pomp and show at Lauda. On one such year, King Divya Raya had made all the necessary arrangements. The Pandits and Ramanas and all the residents of Nabha Gram were invited to the royal palace to attend this grand festival. Shri Advaita had also come to attend the occasion along with Kubera Pandita. When the king noticed that Shri Advaita did not pay obeisances unto the deity of Goddess Kali, he requested him to do the same. Shri Advaita however refused, reasoning that any person who worships other demigods or demigoddesses instead of worshipping the Supreme Lord Shri Krishna is cast into bewilderment and material misery. Hearing his son's statement, Shri Kubera Pandita countered Advaita and urged him to pay his obeisances unto Maa Kali to not disrespect her. Shri Advaita consented to fulfill his father's desire, but as soon as Advaita Acharya entered the temple and paid his prostrated obeisances, the deity of Kali broke into pieces. The king came to tears witnessing the broken deity. Goddess Kali could not tolerate receiving obeisances from Shri Advaita, the combined incarnation of Mahavishnu and Sadashiva, her most worshipable lord. Shri Advaita did not wish to reveal his divine identity to anyone just yet. Hence, after this pastime, he moved over to Shantipur where he occupied himself with studying devotional scriptures and propagating the glories of Shri Krishna.

Even though Shamananda Prabhu was Hrudaya Chaitanya's initiated disciple, his guru had entrusted him to the care of Jivagoswami Prabhu. Through the association of Jiva and service to him, Shamananda developed a taste for serving Radha and Krishna. In the conjugal mood, an extraordinary incident which took place in Vrindavan prior to his being ordered by Jiva to return to Orissa, demonstrates how dear Shamananda was to Radharani. One day, Shamananda Prabhu was sweeping the Rasa Mandala in Vrindavan, absorbed in an ecstatic trance. Suddenly, by Radharani's transcendental mercy, he found her ankle bracelet torn. He saw the ankle bracelet lying on the ground. In his excitement, he touched the ankle bracelet to his forehead, where it left a mark preserved to this day as the Tilak marking of the disciple's descendant of Shamananda. It is known as Nupura Tilaka. You must have noticed the Tilaka that Babaji is wearing is the shape of the footprint of Radharani or Nupura. There are two stories, one says it is Radharani's seat, one says it is Nupura. So it is called Nupura Tilaka. So they are called the Samanandis today.

Same thing happened in Orissa when he was calling Srinivasa's name, before the arrival of Srinivasa Thakur. So in your small book there is a prayer to Narottama Das Thakur. We can chant that first. Shri Krishna Nama Amrita Varshi Vaktra Chandraprabha Dvashtha Tamo Bharaya Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu stayed at Ramkeli for a few days, constantly surrounded by an ocean of ecstatic devotees who were eager to bathe in the purifying waters of the Lord's transcendental association. Not only was the general mass of people affected by the Lord, but even the Mohammedan king had a change of heart due to Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's presence. One day, as Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was dancing with his associates during Sankirtana, he suddenly looked in the direction of Shri Keturi village. A peculiar look appeared on his face. Tears came to his eyes and he cried out Narottama, Narottama again and again. The ocean of mercy, Nithyananda Raya, shouted with joy and Haridas, Vakreshwara and others were inexplicably filled with unbounded happiness. Witnessing this unusual behavior of the Lord, the devotees began talking amongst themselves as follows. Prabhu is repeatedly calling out the name of someone called Narottama. It seems that this Narottama is extremely devious. Perhaps he is about to make his appearance. Oh, who is that fortunate man who will have such a son! The woman who bears him within her womb certainly is the most fortunate lady in this world. Obviously, the Lord has some plan for this Narottama to fulfill his missions. In this way, rumors of Narottama's impending appearance spread far and wide. Oh, who is this Narottama? The wheel of time turned until finally during the sixth hour of the full moon day in the month of Magha,

**Summary:** This segment details Narottama Das Thakur's birth, the astrological predictions surrounding him, his refusal to eat until food is offered to Lord Vishnu, and the subsequent emphasis on the importance of Prasad.

when all auspicious signs became visible, Narottamadas was born to fulfill the mission of the Lord. His mother, radiant with beauty, wept joyfully as she lovingly gazed at the charming face of her son. A divine effulgence illuminated the delivery room and happiness swelled within the hearts of everyone present. The delighted Dattamahasaya warmly welcomed everyone without taking his eyes off the face of his son for a second. Krishnananda's exalted father profusely distributed charity to the singers, musicians and other present for the protection of his grandson. So his father is Dattamahasaya, grandfather is Krishnananda. There was no woman in the world as fortunate as Narottamada's mother. Narayana. By the grace of Lord, she was granted the divine vision to see Gauranga, Nityananda and Advaita dancing ecstatically in her house. Narayana jubilantly watched as his son continued to grow like the waxing moon. Similarly, Krishnananda's pleasure grew no bounds as he constantly stared at the jewel-like face of his son. Being grateful because of his great fortune, he fed the local brahmanas. Daily, on an auspicious day, Krishnananda arranged for the ceremony of offering rice to his son. The astrologer present on that joyful occasion noted all the auspicious signs present in the child's body. He predicted that the boy would become an illustrious person, saying, This baby will grow up to be the greatest of men. Therefore, he should be called Narottama. The festivities went on happily until Krishnananda tried to feed his son some rice. To everyone's dismay, the child refused to eat. Although they coaxed him again and again, the boy repeatedly turned his head away, refusing to eat. The festive atmosphere was thus replaced with anxiety as everyone nervously looked at one another, not knowing what to do. The thoughtful astrologer then replied, Don't worry, this boy will not accept food unless it was first offered to Lord Vishnu. The rice was then offered to Lord Vishnu and once again given to the child. To everyone's relief, the baby happily devoured it. From that day onwards, realizing the value of prasad, Krishnananda ordered, Only food that has been offered to Krishna should be given to my son.

According to Prema Vilasa, When Mahaprabhu passed through Kanena Shala, he was dancing ecstatically in Kirtan. He began to call out the name Narottama, Narottama. When Nithyananda asked him why he was calling out this name, Mahaprabhu answered, There will be one exalted devotee by the name Narottama, will soon be born here. Mahaprabhu then went on to the Padmavati river on the place known as Kutuppur, where he bathed and sang and danced in ecstasy. He then called out to the river, O Padmavati, take my love and keep it here. When Narottama comes and bathes here, give it to him. The Padmavati inquired, How will I recognize him? Mahaprabhu answered, You will know it is Narottama, for when he enters your water, you will overflow. The place where Mahaprabhu placed Prema for Narottama's sake, was later given the name Premtali. When Narottama was twelve years old, he had a dream in which Nithyananda Prabhu told him to bathe in the Padmavati and take the Prema which had been stored there for him. He went the next day to the Padma and as soon as he put his foot in the water, the river started to overflow. The Padmavati then remembered Mahaprabhu's words and gave Narottama the Prema which she had been safeguarding for him.

**Summary:** This segment describes the three ways in which Chaitanya Mahaprabhu bestows His mercy: destruction of material miseries, reconciliation of scriptural contradictions, and inspiration for devotional service.

If somebody achieves the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, how will he receive it? Actually, Mahaprabhu bestows His mercy upon the devotees in three ways. The first way a devotee gets the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, very easily, is that all the material miseries are destroyed, and the person becomes purified. Transcendental ecstasy is awakened in his heart, a bliss is awakened in his heart, which covers up all the material miseries, and also all the material pleasures. The second manifestation of the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is, all the contradictions in the scriptures get reconciled, and you are able to understand what is the essence of the scriptures: Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God, and that firmly gets established in your heart. And not only that, what happens is, the transcendental mellows get revealed to us. The third aspect of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mercy is, He establishes inspiration to do devotional service with ecstasy and the appreciation of the conjugal pastimes of Krishna.

Shri Nithyananda Prabhu is none other than Lord Balaram, the first expansion of the Supreme Personality of God. Naratham Das Thakur sings, vrajendra nandana say sachi sutta haila say balram haila nithai. Vrajendra nandana is Lord Krishna, the master of Vraja, and sachi sutta refers to the son of Mother Sachi. So the same person who previously had been the darling of Vrindavana has now incarnated as Sri Chaitanya, the son of Sachi Mata. Similarly, the person who previously had been Lord Balaram has now appeared as Nithyananda Prabhu.

So we saw the house where they were all staying after lunch this afternoon. According to hearsay, after his marriage, Lord Nithyananda had requested the local Zavindar here in Kardaha to kindly allot him a piece of land where he and his family could reside. The Zavindar, being unaware of Lord Nithyananda's divinity, rebuked him for abandoning his sanyasa and accepting a wife later on. The Zavindar, at the time of conversation, was fishing along with his friends. He sarcastically replied to Nithyananda that if he really needed a piece of land to stay, then he would have to create it out of water. Saying this, the zamindar threw a piece of burning straw into the Ganges in order to mark the place on water where the zamindar decided Lord Nithyananda should set up his residence, making fun of Lord Nithyananda Prabhu in front of his friends. Nithyananda Prabhu, who always remained very humble and without any anger, did not mind the zamindar's harsh words and assured the zamindar that whatever he had wished, though sarcastically, would surely come to pass. What happened next stunned all present. A huge mass of land suddenly appeared from the water exactly at the place where the burning piece of straw had hit it. Then this newly created island then got connected with the mainland. This place subsequently came to be known as Kardaha. Kar means straw in Bengali.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Kunjavatika and the story of Abhirama Thakur's powerful blessings and Nityananda Prabhu's fear for his son Bhirachandra.

His transcendental house is presently renovated all over the three worlds as Kunjavatika. There is a very sweet pastime that has been narrated in Abhirama Leelamrita which talks of Shri Abhirama Gopala Thakura's arrival in Kardaha. Shri Abhirama Gopal Thakur, one of the most prominent of the twelve cowherd boys, Dwaadasha Gopala, had a very powerful personality. He was a great friend of an intimate associate of Shri Nithyananda Prabhu. If Abhirama Thakur bowed down to any person who was not the Lord or empowered by the Lord, then that person would die immediately. Similarly, if he bowed down before any stone that was not a Saligramshila, then that stone would immediately crack. Several deities in Bengal had cracked just because Shri Abhirama had paid them his obeisances. All the previous seven sons of Nithyananda Prabhu had died because Sri Abhirama Thakur had paid them his dhandavats. However, when Sri Bhirachand Prabhu appeared in this world, Lord Nithya was very careful not to invite Sri Abhirama Gopal Thakur to attend his childbirth ceremony. He feared that Abhirama would again bow down and cause harm to the child. Though Lord Nithya was an expansion of the Supreme Lord, yet he played his part like a normal father and therefore expressed his concern and anguish. Nithyananda

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Abhirama Thakur, describing his miraculous crossing of the Ganges and his eventual blessing of Bhirachandra.

Hence, he instructed all the boatsmen of Kardaha not to transport Abhirama Thakur to the other side of Ganges in case he was seen that day. Sri Abhirama Gopal was a covert boy of Vrindavan and he neither had any ego, nor did he care for any false prestige. In a very innocent mood, living behind all inhibitions, he set out for Kardaha without any invitation to meet his dear friend and bless his newborn. When Abhirama Thakur arrived on the bank of Ganges and asked the boatmen to carry him to Kardaha, the boatmen panicked. Running out of options, they drowned their boats in the water. But Abhirama then simply spread his grace and said, and then, sitting on that floating cloth, peacefully crossed over the river. Seeing his prowess, all the onlookers were amazed. When Abhirama finally arrived at Kunjavatika, Nithyananda Prabhu courteously embraced him and fed him sumptuously. Thereafter, in spite of Srimati Janava and Vasudha Devi's presence, Abhirama bowed down again and paid his obeisances to little Birchandra. When he saw that no harm was caused to the little child, he was overjoyed and composed verses glorifying him, understanding that he was the expansion of the Supreme Lord.

In an innocent mood, he sang and danced in ecstasy. Thus, Sri Birchandra Prabhu had displayed the exalted symptoms of divinity since his very birth. Sri Nithyananda Prabhu had performed the most amazing pastimes here in Kardaha, which cannot be completely described even with a thousand mouths. Such was his magnanimity, such was his mood, that he freely distributed the treasure of Lord's love. His uncommon, unique pastime moved even the atheist to cry tears of love. Lord Nithya was almost completely devoid of any external consciousness and remained intoxicated in an ecstatic love of God. In such a state of utter ecstasy, he would sometimes jump high up in the air or at other times roll over the ground while continuously glorifying the Supreme Lord. Sometimes he would laugh and at other times streams of tears would roll down his beautiful eyes. Srimati Janava Devi, Vasudha Devi, and Birchandra Prabhu have all manifested their sweet pastimes.

**Summary:** The speaker establishes Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead from birth, contrasting this with modern, self-proclaimed incarnations.

OM NAMO BADRAVATE VASUDEVAYA Reading from Srimad-Bhagavatam, 10-1, Chapter 1, Text No. 20 TRITVANTI LAKARMANI SAHARAMENA KESAVA ATIMARTYANI BADRAVAN GRUDA TRAPATAP MANUSAH Lord Shri Krishna, the personality of broadhead, along with Balram, played like a human being, and so must he perform. Many superhuman acts. The doctrines of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism are never applicable to Shri Krishna or the personality of broadhead. The theory that a man becomes broad by dint of penance and austerities is wrong. The theory that a man becomes broad is very much rampant nowadays, especially in India. Since Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, and Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were detected by the sages and saints to be the personality of broadhead, as indicated in revealed scriptures, many unscrupulous men have created their own incarnations. This process of contracting an incarnation of God has become an ordinary business, especially in Bengal. Any popular personality with a few traits of mystic powers will displace some feet of jugglery and easily become an incarnation of God by popular vote. Lord Shri Krishna was not that type of incarnation. He was actually the personality of broadhead from the very beginning of his appearance. He appeared before his so-called mother, as four-armed Vishnu. Then, at the request of the mother, he became like a human child and at once left her for another devotee at Grotul, where he was accepted as the son of Nanda Maharaj and Yasoda Mata. Similarly, Shri Baladeva, the counterpart of Lord Shri Krishna, was also considered a human child, born of the mother of Lord Krishna. He was also considered a human child, born of the mother of Lord Krishna. He was also considered a human child,

**Summary:** Knowing Krishna's transcendental nature leads to liberation, as described in the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam.

born of another wife of Shri Vasudeva. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says that his birth and deeds are transcendental and that anyone who is so fortunate as to know the transcendental nature of his birth and deeds will at once become liberated and eligible to return to the kingdom of God. So, knowledge of the transcendental nature of the birth and deeds of Lord Shri Krishna is sufficient for liberation. In Bhagavatam, the transcendental nature of the Lord is described in nine cantos and in the tenth canto, his specific pastimes are taken up. All this becomes known as one's reading of this literature progresses. It is important to note here, however, that the Lord exhibited his divinity even from the lap of his mother, that his deeds were all superhuman, that he lifted the Jordan Hill at the age of seven, and that all these acts definitely prove him to be actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet, due to his mystic reverence, he was always accepted as an ordinary human child by his so-called father and mother and other relatives. Whenever some Herculean task was performed by him, they did not accept it otherwise, and they remained satisfied with unflinching filial love for their son. As such, the sage of Naimisaranya described him as apparently resembling a human being, but actually, he is the Supreme,

So, Romashana was supposed to do that, but however, Romashana was killed by Balarama, because he was quite proud of his knowledge, and he did not respect Balarama. Then his son, Suta, was told, because Suta heard from Sukadeva Goswami, the whole Bhagavatam which was narrated. So he was selected to speak.

Krishna conscious life, in small small realizations which we have, cannot be different from the conclusions of these personalities. Brahma has concluded that Ishvara is Paramakrishna.

He has a form which is not material but which is Sat, Chit and Ananda, which is eternal, which is full of knowledge and which is full of Ananda, irrespective of what form he takes, because the form is unlimited, it has all the potencies, so he can take any form and all the forms he take is Sat, it's eternal, it's full of knowledge, awareness of everything and it is blissful. Unlike our body, which is full of blood, pus, mucus, all kinds of liquids flowing inside the body which we don't have any idea of, all kinds of different instruments which is pumping, which is beating, which is cleaning, which you have no idea about, which if you don't take care of it will rot.

**Summary:** The speaker explains why the Vedas were traditionally kept from those with a 'Shudra mentality' due to their tendency to exploit knowledge for selfish purposes.

So they they were educated class they said there are stories for children just to teach them good habits, teach them this Lord, teach them some principles, moral principles in life. But Lord is Nirananda, the supreme Brahman as explained in Vedas and Upanishads. So they totally swung to one side giving a Purana and Bhaktisiddhanta had a tough time to establish that Puranas. Purana is the oldest. Puranas are older than Vedas or older than Upanishad. And they had to write commentaries on different Upanishads to conclude Bhakti as a supreme. Vedas do talk of Bhakti but it is very covered. Why is it covered? Because in the creation itself they don't want unintelligent Shudra mentality people to understand the supreme Lord. Why? Because the Shudra mentality is always exploitation. Brahmanical quality is always doubt-telling. These are the two qualities you see in the material. Either I exploit everything for my sense gratification or I can utilize it. So a devotee, a Vaishnava, his qualification is that he utilizes things for the supreme. That is what is called supreme Lord. Just like a son he will utilize all the riches of the father to increase the business of the father. But a bad son he would exploit everything and waste everything. So these are the two classes of people. So when the Shudra mentality people understand the Vedas, they will exploit it. Hence the Vedas were always kept away from them not because they were not qualified... not because they were not equally qualified to learn from them, but because they were not qualified enough to learn from them.

**Key Quote:** "And the Vedic Shastras are such that only if you accept an authority you would get the knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vedic principle of accepting authority with the modern 'Shudra mentality' that rejects any form of subservience.

but they are not qualified in their character in their Brahmanical qualities in their quality of surrender when you don't have the quality of surrender then you would exploit even the Vedic knowledge so the Brahmanical people they would learn this but the Supreme Lord's position in the Vedas is very very covered kuhyam it is covered and kept and the Upanishads which are supplemented to the Vedas are experiential knowledge of the great rishis so Upanishads are all written with great sages but they have expounded Bhakti in that but these rationalist people they kept it aside and they thought Vedas and Upanishads are great where there is form of the Lord is not given but we all know great Upanishads Manduk Upanishad all the issue Upanishad these Upanishads give the form of the Lord in fact the Upanishad says the Lord is an autocratic person that he will give Bhakti to only person who is totally dedicated and whose favored by the Lord and the Lord can favor anybody and anybody he wants no qualities no qualification if the Lord wants he will come for Bhakti on that person he does not look for any other qualification is an autocrat not to accept autocratic position of the Lord Sudra and Mantra will not work. We are all having Shudra mentality. Shudra mentality means I don't want to be subservient. Rather Shudras are the modern world, not the old Shudras. Old Shudras are subservient. But the modern Shudras are intelligent Shudras, educated Shudras. Educated Shudras means I don't want any boss. I am the Lord. So the Shudra mentality cannot accept an authority.

### Humility, Krishna's indifference, Popularity, Truth

**Key Quote:** "The Lord is a person who doesn't care that he is a Lord. He doesn't care if you accept me as God or not, because I am God."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's indifference to being recognized as God with the desire of human 'lords' to control and manipulate, and discusses the difference between truth and purchased popularity.

And the Vedic Shastras are such that only if you accept an authority you would get the knowledge. This is contradictory. I don't want to accept a Lord, I don't want to accept a leader, but I want to know who is God. That is not possible. The process of understanding Lord is to be humble, subservient, surrender, serve, then earn the mercy and you get the Lord. Because permanently a living entity is subservient. Sub-servient. Sub-servient. Constitutionally living entity is subservient. So the modern age people can never accept Lord Krishna, Lord Balaram as the Supreme Lord. And the Lord doesn't care. There is a Lord. There are so many Lords in this material world. They care a lot that they are Lords. The Lord is a person who doesn't care that he is a Lord. He doesn't care if you accept me as God or not, because I am God. But the modern Gods like us, we want to show that I am Lord, so I control people, I manipulate. That is politics. Human Lords want to show that they are Lord and they will do anything and everything to conclude they are Lord. They will advertise. But Krishna doesn't advertise. Krishna can turn the mind of everybody and all newspapers will say, yes, Krishna is the Supreme Lord. All newspapers, same as people accept. The Lord does not look for popularity. So when truth is there, popularity may not be there. And many people want to accept truth, which is very popular. And that is a problem in modern age. That person who is most popular must be the right person. But the popularity of this material world is purchased popularity.

**Key Quote:** "So the latest trip is to call oneself Guru. That is the latest trip. I can't call myself Bhagavan."
**Summary:** The speaker critiques the modern trend of self-proclaimed gurus who prioritize popularity over scriptural truth.

Either with money or with one's karma. If you are karmically very, very strong person, you will be popular. But just because you are popular doesn't mean that you are Lord. In olden days, like in 70s, 80s, 90s, the biggest trip was for people to say he is Bhagavan. This Bhagavan, that Bhagavan, so many Bhagavans had in Prabhupada's time. So Prabhupada explains, people want to be Bhagavan. Why? Small, small trickery. Small tricks or mysticism. Maybe mystic or mostly it is trick. 99% is trick. Create ash, useless stuff. And people call him Bhagavan. But modern days, people have understood. Human beings are not fools. So I cannot call myself Bhagavan. So the latest trip is to call oneself Guru. That is the latest trip. I can't call myself Bhagavan. Out of question. Because people, if not fool people. Not only that, I don't even have karma to create basma, to create ash. At least those Bhagavans had some power to create ash. The modern Bhagavans don't have power to create ash. So they have stopped talking about themselves to be Bhagavan. But they are all pure Gurus. Why? Popularity. Then you can become popular. And you talk what people want to listen to. You don't talk what people want to listen to. You don't talk what people want to listen to. You don't talk what people want to listen to. You don't talk what people want to listen to. And you're not going to be popular. You'll be biased because you're not getting what Shastras say. In fact they say don't read Shastra. Because you'll be contaminated by Shastra. You'll be biased. You have to create knowledge on your own. Doesn't matter what stupid things they are talking. So this is the modern. So gullible people, they get

attracted to these things. Not to the Supreme Lord, Krishna. Not only in the modern age, there was a period of Duryodhanas and Karna. who never accepted Krishna many sages Narada Vyasa Bhishma all these people went and told Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra do you know who this Krishna is do you know whom you are playing with whom are you trying to be against because Duryodhana had one idea if I catch Krishna then Pandavas are won over because if you catch Krishna what will Pandavas do they'll come running and say whatever you want to take leave Krishna right Pandavas are so attached to Krishna Yudhishthira Arjuna Bhima these people say you want the kingdom you want to kill us do whatever you want so Duryodhana knew the position of Krishna as dear to Pandavas and he always wanted to capture Krishna because he thought Krishna yes he is great but not God he's a mystic person but my mysticism is more than his so if I capture him if I tie him when he comes for peace he's coming for peace talks he's a great Chalu person he'll have some ideas if I capture him then I won no war so these Duryodhanas and Dhritarashtras thought Krishna is ordinary so all these knowledgeable sages told him don't play with Krishna and they showed so many stories how he and Arjuna are great personalities you cannot win over them Krishna is none other than Narayana Arjuna is none other than Nara they are the original Nara and Narayana mystical great mystic personalities the supreme person having all the controls and they told so many stories about how great great kings proud kings wanted to fight there is a king who wanted to want to fight everybody in this world and finally as sages told why are you so puffed up you really want to fight with equals go and fight with Nara Narayana where is he found he is in Badrikashyam go and fight with him he went all the way to Badrikashyam to fight and Narayana said we have no time we are busy no I don't need to fight everybody sages all the sages say that you are the right person to fight Nara Narayana was meditating and they created all huge army of people and this king was shit scared and he wouldn't fight at least he surrendered at last so there are great kings like this even bigger kings than you Duryodhana who have realized the position of Nara and Narayana and surrendered to them you also surrender to them. At least he surrendered. you'll benefit but asurik mentality shudra mentality is such that the anger and the ego takes over and they don't want to surrender

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the realization of great sages regarding Krishna's supremacy and the necessity of surrendering to Him for our well-being.

so Krishna came for peace deal Krishna came Mahabharata explains the whole way how Krishna appeared in the great assembly huge assembly of all great kings and all the sages also came to hear what Krishna is going to say just like we send a mobile message and everybody comes but the sages don't need any mobile messages they all know when is the right time then the Lord will speak when to go and hear him they're all mystic understanding with some modern people who have no idea because for them space is an empty space but space is full of essence energy which has all the subtle energies in it so this great sages use all these methods to hear and understand what is happening in this world what is the latest avatar are doing when is the latest avatar are speaking when the Lord comes when does he speak so they are all interested in hearing the Lord so these great personalities realize a lot not because they are fools not because they are gullible because they have establish the truth that Krishna is the supreme Lord through their experiences in their life they have realized that human body is so limited human life is so limited we cannot anyway become God but our nature is such is Ananda we have a rightful position to be happy but we're looking for happiness in the wrong direction they have realized that they have gone in for happiness in the wrong direction they have realized that they have gone in said themselves and meditated and they have realized the vedic truth and that is upanishad realized vedic knowledge is upanishad but puranas are hitihasas which are historical narrations of the supreme lord which is given in puranas so the gaudiya vaishnavas they have worked hard to put purana and among puranas bhagavatam as the most important purana which is actual truth which talks and reveals the truth they are not stories whatever is told in purana the historical narrations and all these people have realized supreme lord krishna who is enacting like a human being whether illiterate people like devaki or or or the mother of pandavas kuntidevi or learned personalities like bhisma or great sages as as vyasa narada devala asita doesn't matter who they are from simple people to most intelligent class of people who have concluded krishna is a supreme personality of godhead and we are part and parcel of him and our our goodness or our safety is in surrendering to him

**Summary:** The speaker explains that bhakti reveals itself and is self-sustaining, starting with faith (sraddha).

so these are concluded by the great sages by their experiences so bhakti reveals bhakti itself we need to start bhakti when we start a little bit of bhakti more bhakti is revealed and we do when we do that more bhakti another more bhakti is is established in the heart so bhakti establishes bhakti but we need to start and where do we start with sraddha with faith if this sraddha is not there then we cannot start we are this we have to start the car unless the car started it won't move so starting process is having a little bit of faith so we are people who have got that little faith and we have surrendered to krishna now we need to fan that faith and make it convert into shuddha bhakti and once you get bhakti bhakti is self-sustained bhakti sustains bhakti there's no question of outside push needed to get bhakti now we are pushing ourselves so many things to get bhakti so much of struggle bodily struggle mental struggle push from others so many so many requirements are there for us to do bhakti because bhakti is very very kumala but this kumala bhakti once it is fanned it becomes very very strong so we don't need anything else

**Key Quote:** "we are not able to fan the bhakti because we are giving importance to ourselves ourself when you say we are not giving importance to the soul if we are giving importance to the soul then that becomes our own self interest and that is needed but when we don't know who you we are when we think i am my intelligence when i think i am my ego where i have my priorities when i think that i am a mind which has his preferences and non-preferences then we cannot surrender"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that self-importance hinders the growth of bhakti, and that surrender is impossible when we identify with our ego and mind.

bhakti can sustain itself example is given like a person who is eating a person who is hungry and is eating he feels satisfaction on his own you go and ask him you're satisfied yes how do you know you're satisfied no i know i'm satisfied but how do you know you're satisfied i'm satisfied bhakti is like that once again bhakti you're satisfied by itself so bhakti has this tendency it provides more bhakti and it sustains itself so these great personalities have done that and that is what we need to do but we need to fan the bhakti we are not able to fan the bhakti because we are giving importance to ourselves ourself when you say we are not giving importance to the soul if we are giving importance to the soul then that becomes our own self interest and that is needed but when we don't know who you we are when we think i am my intelligence when i think i am my ego where i have my priorities when i think that i am a mind which has his preferences and non-preferences then we cannot surrender my ego is important my popularity is important my worship is important my respect is important as long as we go with this thought bhakti will not flourish yeah some spark is there in us but that spark has been converted always example is given bhakti with this story of making we always say making of this jaggery good if these malas are not removed bhakti does not become pure just like when you make when you make candy you have to remove all the mucks which is coming out otherwise candy will not be pure candy it will be filled with dust so our bhakti is filled with dust

### Anarthas, False identification, Supreme Lord's pleasure, Real Bhakti

**Key Quote:** "But real bhakti means I do it because Krishna is pleased. The more I do, Krishna is pleased."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the various false identifications that prevent pure bhakti, emphasizing that real bhakti is performed for Krishna's pleasure, not for self-gratification.

why because we have not removed all these anarthas mother matsadiyah puja pratishta lava i am woman i am man i am wife i am husband i am thin i am thick i am powerful i am weak powerful has a pr has a pride being proud and the weak people have the depression that they are weak. Both are wrong. Right? Self-pitying is also sense gratification. Well, you are not that. You are not that mind which is depressed. Nor are you that mind which is very powerful. So unless we realize that we are simple souls supposed to surrender to the Lord, perform our Bhakti Yuga without any kind of comparison of importance, identifying the mistakes in others, glorifying the small goodness in oneself, this is our time. When we do Bhakti, when we do Seva, we are not thinking of the Supreme Lord's pleasure. We are supposed to think of the Supreme Lord's pleasure, I'm washing a pot, I'm making a garland, I am cleaning a place. I am thinking about my importance. Or I am thinking about the weakness of others. Oh, he doesn't do properly. He is very proud. He is puffed up. He is not surrendered. He doesn't do anything properly. I do everything very nice. But I am doing it with this consciousness. But real bhakti means I do it because Krishna is pleased. The more I do, Krishna is pleased. I am tying a garland for Krishna. I am cleaning a place. I am preaching to somebody. So, whenever we do bhakti, more bhakti is not coming. Because we are shutting the door with our importance. So, with that mentality, we cannot understand Krishna.

### Popularity, Truth, Bhagavatam, Gaudiya Vaishnavas

**Key Quote:** "But a self-realized person is he who sides with truth always. Whether the truth is popular or not popular."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts siding with popularity versus siding with truth, highlighting that Bhagavatam and Gaudiya Vaishnavas prioritize truth over popularity.

Today we are understanding Krishna because Krishna is very popular. ISKCON has made Krishna very popular. So, I also want to be a devotee in ISKCON. Tomorrow, when there are thousands of newspapers talking bad of ISKCON. No, no, no. I don't go to ISKCON. Before I used to go. Now, I don't go. We always want to side with which is advantageous. We don't want to side with truth. But a self-realized person is he who sides with truth always. Whether the truth is popular or not popular. Whether it is accepted by thousands or not accepted by anybody. Truth is truth. And that is what Bhagavatam is. Bhagavatam doesn't make us gullible and weak to side with what is popular for our safety. Bhagavatam does not look about human safety. It looks about the position of the Supreme Lord. Hence, Gaudiya Vaishnava always positioned Krishna in his right form. Free from all malas, free from all material tinges. That is the beauty of Bhagavatam number one. And the beauty of Gaudiya Vaishnava is such that they don't compromise for their name, fame. When we start, especially big institutions like us, when we become too conscious of the public popularity, truth will be given second position. And Gaudiya Vaishnavas don't do that. Truth is always first. Whether you are popular, whether you are accepted, whether people are throwing stones or people are throwing flowers. Everybody wants to get flowers thrown at. Nobody wants stones to be thrown at. But truth will not hide when stones are thrown. So Bhagavatam makes us very confident that Krishna is the Supreme Lord. He is the conclusion. He is the person to whom we have to surrender. And that is of our benefit.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of unwavering faith in Krishna's supremacy, regardless of changing public opinion.

Doesn't matter materially what is the position. As ages go by, sometimes some are popular, sometimes some are not popular. In the beginning days of ISKCON, we were never popular. As soon as anybody sees devotees, they only say Dhammarodham. Right? So you are going to ISKCON what? You get ganja there? There is a time when okay, this has become very popular. When you are popular, many people want to side. But when something negative comes, how many of us will stand? With Bhagavatam. Some great person comes and talks against Krishna, will you change your mind? Bhagavatam gives us the strength not to change the mind. Bhagavatam gives us the strength that Krishna is absolute. This is practical. This is practically experienced knowledge. So we don't want anybody to say Krishna is right or wrong. We don't want anybody to say Krishna is right or wrong. We don't want anybody to say Krishna is right or wrong. We have to show magic. So we need to grow in our Bhakti, in our faith in such a way that we don't get shaken by different popular bitter sayings or theories at different times. Every 50 years or every 30 years opinions change, public opinion changes. Devotees don't go by the change in public opinion. They only have one opinion.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that absolute knowledge is realized by prioritizing Vaishnavas, Guru, and Krishna above oneself.

And we have just been there for thousands and thousands of years, millions and millions of years. millennium five years back Chaitanya Mahaprabhu established five thousand years Krishna established and thousands and thousands of years before sages have established Krishna is a supreme person. Ekala Eeshwara Krishna Aarasa Babhratiya so that knowledge is absolute knowledge other knowledges are all relative knowledge which changes according to taste and if you say why we are not getting that confidence why we are not getting that that absolute truth in us as established or realized and we determined to follow it properly it because of our own weakness and the weakness is only one thing we put ourselves first what our situation comes we put ourselves first we don't put guru and Krishna first not guru we have to put Vaishnava's guru and Krishna first oh I'll put Krishna first always I have no other way he is first okay I take a Diksha I'll put guru also first no no doubt of choice I had to go through guru. Vaishnava's I can't put Vaishnava's first why my ego doesn't allow my self-importance doesn't allow but bhakti is such that only when we put Vaishnava's guru and Krishna first we get bhakti so this is something which has to be practiced. So this is something which has to be practiced. So this is something which has to be practiced. done in our day-to-day life then bhakti becomes fixed real bhakti becomes fixed in our heart so this is Bhagavatam's conclusion and this is

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the common misconception of seeking personal happiness in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing that true fulfillment comes from serving Krishna's satisfaction.

Hare Krishna we mainly come to ISKCON for our happiness but now as you said we have to satisfy guru and Krishna the cat is out we come to Krishna for our happiness we come to go to temple for our happiness that is the first thing you have to understand we are not coming here for our happiness and you're with thanks for being very honest because 99% of the people come for this and that is where they get dejected that is why they get hit we get hit when we come for our happiness we never get hit when we come for Krishna's happiness so it's the most important point we have to come to Krishna Krishna consciousness for give me happiness to Krishna Rishikesh Rishikesh seven we understand that he is a master of the senses and we had to understand that our senses are for his satisfaction otherwise it is becoming Ulta I am the God and he is a servant I either God is being very happy people come with lot of desires to the temple and the primary motive of this desires are nothing but self-centered benefit happiness popularity importance whatever it is and that leads to frustration and that stops our bhakti but when we come to Krishna consciousness I am here for you lot you use me which way you want

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is concerned with the bhava (devotion) behind our actions, not the material offerings themselves.

because of the understand the it is coming is springing from the understanding that going to temple is for happiness because I'm the house I'm always unhappy at least out of the house I'm happy Ulta olden days how how suppose we happy place the happiest person is he who has no loans happiest person is he who eats his food in his house but nowadays happiest person is he who eats in big restaurants happiest person is he who's full of loans and avoids paying back result so we come to the temple the understanding is oh I'll be happy I'm all my problems would be gone that is not the real case that is a byproduct being happy once I was a byproduct because we are part and parcel of Krishna when the root is sufficiently nourished all the parts of the tree become nourished same way when the Supreme Lord the Supreme person Poorna person is made happy we the subse these parts and parcels automatically becomes happy that is a proper understanding so people bring things people give money I'll give money if I my name is put in 10 inches bold right I brought Carlin today and the Witcher he did not put it on the Lord I'm so unhappy why because I I wanted to see my my mala on the Lord and feel oh my mala is there my mala is there mala is very beautiful because of me the dress I stitch because I stitch is very beautiful oh the Pujari did not put the put the dress which I gave oh temple did not use a sari which I give my work is to give Lord wants he will wear it I guess today we heard the story of Jagannath world wants evill he will take the worst of the Lotus putrefied flower also because he is not seeing the flower he is not saying how beautiful dress you stitch he He is not seeing how much flowers he bought, how many rupees he gave, what he gave, what vehicle he gave temple, what material he gave temple. He is seeing what was behind that. Bhava grahi janatana. He is always bhava grahi janatana. He only wants the bhava in which you are doing it. He does not want really what you do it. He will accept it. But that is not what he is really looking at. He is looking with what bhava did you say. With what bhava are you preaching? Are you preaching to become a guru? Or are you preaching to glorify me, the Lord? Are you doing this service for self-respect and position and name and fame? Or are you doing it to please me? So, Lord does not change. He is only looking for bhava. So, we have to understand that.

### Lord as the Center, Object vs. Subject, Surrender, Bhakti

**Key Quote:** "When you make the Lord the center, you are the object and the subject."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of making the Lord the center of our lives, understanding that we are the object of His attention and service.

We are here to serve him. We do not want him to serve. There are two concepts. One is I am the center and other is the Lord is the center. When you make the Lord the center, you are the object and the subject. We go to the temple thinking that we are the object. We are the subject. We think Lord is the object. Lord is not the object. You are the object. Or we are the object. Lord is seeing you. The Lord is seeing what you are doing. The Lord is seeing how you are doing. Ours is ulta. I go and see the Lord. I do for the Lord. So, that is different. So, when I make the Lord the center and I am the object of the Lord. The Lord is seeing me. So, our pleasure, our happiness is automatic. It is naturally there. It is automatic. But when we go only for our sake to the temple, we go for our sake to the organization, then we can get disappointed. Many times this is what happens. In the beginning, we are very enthusiastic. Later on, we are not enthusiastic because we put ourselves first. So, if you experience this, put yourself last and see. Nothing will happen. Your foot will come. Your life will go on. But the mind will fight. And that is the internal fight which we need to do with Shastra, with the knowledge, with Bhagavatam, with Gita, with the slokas. To remind ourselves that how I am the last. I am not the actual important person. The Lord is. So, entire Krishna conscious life is nothing but this. How we can put others in the front and ourselves last. And that is what the Lord wants. And such a person, Bhakti becomes flourishing in his heart. Bhakti becomes flourishing in his heart. Bhakti becomes flourishing in his heart.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of giving to Krishna, rather than asking for personal benefits, and discusses the love inherent in the Lord's chastisement.

Otherwise, we always ask, what will you do? What will I get? Same thing. What will I get? If I give one rupee, what will I get? If I come to Krishna and say, what will I get? You won't get anything. Rather, he will take everything that you have. But if you tell that, nobody will come. So, yes, in the beginning, we may preach, come, take nice prasadam, you are taken care of, etc, etc. Because of my weakness. Rupa Goswami is always sad. Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami are always sad. Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami are always sad. Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami are always sad. Why is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu giving us importance? Chaitanya Mahaprabhu always criticizes and fires that person, the old person, who gives sandal to Lord Chaitanya, the older personality. Forget his name. So, he chastises us. So, Rupa Goswami knew, we are not able to take the chastisement of the Lord. That is why the Lord is very careful with us. That is why the Lord is very careful with us. He understood the point. Because only when you are loved you are chastised. The liberty of chastisement is only when you are loved. But we cannot take it. We cannot see that love in chastisement. So, Rupa Goswami is always, why are you giving us importance? Because we are not surrendered. When you are surrendered, you give up yourself to the Lord and you don't care whether the Lord is glorifying you or the Lord is chastising you. For you, the Lord is glorifying you. is Lord, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu prayers himself. Whether you accept me or you don't accept me, you embrace me or you kick me away, you are always my love. So that is the conclusion of bhakti. So very important point, as we said, we need to come here

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So our purpose is to come to Krishna to see what I can give, not what I can take."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of giving to Krishna and seeking His pleasure, explaining that true enjoyment comes from being part of Krishna's enjoyment.

to give. Not only people who come here, people who stay here also. People who stay here also have to be giving only. We cannot be receiving. So when we are always giving ourselves to the Lord, we are given the life, people who are inside the temple are given the life. But every day we are carrying out our life. So that doesn't grow, then bhakti doesn't grow. And people who come to the temple from outside have to come with the mentality of giving and not taking back. Taking back subtle happiness, subtle pleasure. I'm giving money. So in one sense I'm charity. I'm giving away one lakh rupees. My bank balance is less by one lakh. I'm giving it. For what? To get name, fame. He is a great congregation devotee. He always gives. Tomorrow another rich man will come richer than you and he will give more. Then you will be sad because my number is gone. But if I was giving to Krishna, not because of earning something from him, then I'll always be happy. So our purpose is to come to Krishna to see what I can give, not what I can take. This is a core misunderstanding we all have. Sometimes many years it takes to understand this. But that's the crux of the point. Chanting Hare Krishna is not for my happiness. Chanting Hare Krishna is for Krishna's happiness. Krishna likes to hear his name. Krishna gives himself up to those people who chant his name purely. Krishna is my next. So the enjoying tendency should only be in Krishna. Because he is the only person who can enjoy. How can a part enjoy? If this finger is thinking that I want to enjoy, it's impossible. It's very unnatural for it. The whole body, the person has to enjoy. Same way the whole body of this universe is Krishna. We are all part and parcel. He can think of enjoyment. Part cannot think of enjoyment. This is, I think, in Mahaprabhu's Achintya Veda, Abheda Tattva, which is a final conclusion. A part cannot think of enjoyment. Only the whole can enjoy. Part can enjoy by being part of enjoyment of the whole.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The real knowledge is surrender. Not ask. Give."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of surrender and giving in Krishna consciousness, and seeking the association of those who speak the truth.

So we always enjoy Prasadam, mercy of the Lord. So in all our activities if we have that in mind, we will always be happy in Krishna consciousness. No matter what happens. So everything is Krishna. We are looking for justice. But we don't understand what are the injustices I did in this world. But from the Lord's point, everything is very just. In your temple, nothing is good. Nobody takes care of me. Nobody gives me Prasadam. I will not come to the temple. Good if you don't come. One problem less. Right? Who is the loser? The Lord doesn't lose anything. The Lord will be sad. The Lord will be angry at the devotees in the temple. Why didn't you make the person come? The Lord will be angry at the devotees in the temple if you don't give the real knowledge to the people. What is the real knowledge? The real knowledge is surrender. Not ask. Give. We are not here to come to ask. We are here to give. And if you are always asking, then we are not teaching you the right thing. But everybody cannot listen to this. Everybody cannot understand. Because if you are always asking, then we are not teaching you the right thing. You cannot understand. Because to understand, this takes time. So these subject matters are not always talked about. But if you really want to know the subject matter of Krishna Consciousness, you have to surrender and you have to pray and you have to earn for the association of those people who talk truth. Despite any adverse. So this is the truth we are talking about in Krishna Consciousness. Right? Okay. Khanderaashimad Bhagavatam Ki. Srila Prabhupada Ki. Satsang with Mooji
