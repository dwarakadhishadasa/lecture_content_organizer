**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Now you have free will. How to respond to your subtle body, your gross body and your kala."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the question of destiny versus choice, explaining that while external factors are governed by karma, the soul has free will to respond to them.

If everything that happens to us is due to past karma, is becoming a devotee also predetermined by it? No, even if everything that happens to us, what happens to us, that means what the environment, what everything outside me does to me, what I am there outside me, I am the outside, outside me means my body, my mind, and the world outside. Everything is outside me. I am not the body. I am sitting in the body. So, my mind, my intelligence, my ego, everything is outside me. My real ego is different. Soul's real ego is outside me. Now, dormant. So now there is a subtle body and the gross body. Soul is there, then subtle body is there, then gross body is there and the world is there. So, the subtle body, the gross body and the world it will interact with you. But the soul will not. It will not interact with you. You are there in this world. You belong in this world. I am saying this according to your past karma, governed by Krishna's impersonal aspect called kala, kala shakti. Kala shakti through according to your karma is predestining you. You. You means the soul. Now you have free will. How to respond to your subtle body, your gross body and your kala.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Even a dog has a free will."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of interacting with a dog to illustrate that even animals have free will to react to their environment, suggesting life is a combination of free will and destiny.

So, you have free will. Now you have free will. How to respond to your subtle body, than the outside world. But how much you can change, how much you can, that depends on like two forces are there. If your force is big, then you will counter it. If that force is big, you will counter it. But we always have a choice, we always have a choice. What to speak of we having the choice? Today I was walking and opposite side one dog was coming. So I was first trying to give way to the dog this way. Then the dog went that way. Then I tried to give dog way this way. I went that side. The dog changed this way. Then again I changed. So as much as I was changing, even a dog has a free will. Even the dog is at that time is waiting for me whether I will go this way or this way. So I can see the dog is ready to finally go this way or that way. That means even a dog has free will. I can force, you don't go this way, I will block it. He will go that way. He will use his free will to go that way. If I go this way, that means according to the way the environment is impacting you, you have got a free will to go this way or that way.

### destiny, free will, karma, God's sanction

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "My destiny is nothing but my past free will."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that destiny is a result of past free will, not arbitrary divine intervention, and uses the analogy of a cow tied to a tree to illustrate the limits and freedom within destiny.

So life is a combination of free will and destiny. Free will and destiny. If you say everything is distinct, that destiny, whatever destiny has come, it will come. Whatever is distinct, who created that? My own past free will. It is not that God has given, put on destiny for you differently, for him differently out of his whims and fancies. If somebody is a beggar today, he has created his destiny, not God. God has sanctioned that, because nothing will move without God, move without Krishna's sanction. Sanction is different, his wish is different. According to your wish, he sanctions. Wish and karma. I will give a simple example. If a cow is tied around a coconut tree, 100 feet rope. Within 100 feet, rope has any effect? No. Moment it goes beyond 100 feet, it will pull. Destiny is like, cow's destiny is 100 feet rope. Even though he cannot go beyond 100 feet, within 100 feet he can go anywhere. There is no destiny.

### destiny, free will, human limitations, karma
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/75xxM5pMnFs?t=357
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So potentially speaking, it is my free will alone that exists. My destiny is nothing but my past free will."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of wanting to fly like a bird to show limitations, and a boil to illustrate how free will can influence the manifestation of karma.

Correct? Let's say I got a, now I am in a human form. I want to fly like a bird. I can see birds are flying. I want to fly like a bird. No. 100 feet rope. You are in a human body, you cannot fly. But within the human body, I got so much freedom. I can go murder somebody. Now you are creating a new rope. So all the destiny that we are, that is putting us here, there, all those things is created by our past. So potentially speaking, it is my free will alone that exists. My destiny is nothing but my past free will. So, what to speak of even material things, material things itself you can go this way, that way, in details, Sukha Dukha is fixed, but you go this way, also this way, just like if you have a boil here, it's your karma. If you take a tablet that boil will go, you don't take a tablet that boil will remain. Now you will say whether the boil was destiny or not. Coming of the boil was destiny or not, going of the boil was destiny or not.

### destiny, karma, suffering, free will
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/75xxM5pMnFs?t=465
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Sukha Dukha, you have created according to your karma, you have to face it."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while the form of suffering may be altered, the underlying karma must be experienced, and reiterates that destiny doesn't dictate every action, using the dog example again.

What will be the answer? The pain, that you have to experience due to this is distinct. If your destiny is that, the Dukha that you have to get because of this is not completed. Even you take medicine, you will get a boil somewhere else or something you will get somewhere else. Sukha Dukha, you have created according to your karma, you have to face it. The shape of that you may be able to change. But in your account you cannot change. Somebody you have given loan, he comes, give my money back. You can tell him, wait, wait. You cannot say I won't give. Right? It is your debt. You can tell him, wait, wait. You cannot say I won't give. In the same way for Papa and Punya that we have done, Sukha and Dukha will come to us. That is destiny. Destiny does not mean that every action is destined. I told you even a dog has got freedom. According to the way I go, it will take a different turn.

### free will, decision-making, soul, influence of modes
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/75xxM5pMnFs?t=550
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The soul is there, acting. He is not a robotic dog."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that even the dog's actions are not purely mechanical, but influenced by the soul's willing, distinguishing it from a robotic response.

It was not destined. It took a decision. Here is somebody coming this side. I should go this side. That means it decided to go that way. Any question on this? Yeah. Limited free will. Sir, it is actually due to the reactions of the horse, it is making its decision and not actually due to the reaction of the dog. Yes. See, for instance, how they, let us not use the word free will, free will. Let us use the word willing. The willing shakti. Dog has got willing shakti. That willing shakti is influenced by the modes. But it is his willing shakti. He is not a machine. He is not a machine. He is influenced by that and therefore he is deciding. The soul is there, acting. He is not a robotic dog. If there is a robotic dog, you can say 100%. There is no willing there. Input, it output, it will decide. But there is an action.

### free will, willing, influence of modes, spiritual world, Krishna consciousness
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/75xxM5pMnFs?t=672
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Free will is an illusion in this world... A decision maker is a soul."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that 'free will' is actually 'willing' influenced by the modes of nature, and that true free will exists in the spiritual world through Krishna consciousness.

Experience inside that dog. In a robot dog, there is no experiencer. So the experiencer wills this way or that way. But that is why I said change the word free will. You are right. That free will, that means freely deciding is not there for anybody in the world. They are all influenced by three modes of nature. But we take a decision. Highly influenced. If you say free will, free will is an illusion in this world. You think you are free. But there is a person who is willing. There is an atna who is willing, whether influenced or uninfluenced, less influenced or more influenced. A decision maker is a soul. So I would say, the answer to your question is, dog was exercising his willing, influenced by my going this side or that side. Understood? At the top level, these are all within the field. Willing, all. At the top level, totally uninfluenced by three modes of material nature. Like Prabhupada can purely act at that level. That level is when one has exercised his free will 100% not to forget Krishna and always be Krishna's.

### free will, limitations, desire, influence of association

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The rope has given you that freedom. 100 feet circle, you can go what you want."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the rope analogy again to illustrate the limited freedom within material existence, emphasizing that desires are not always attainable and that association influences our 'willing'.

That is when our real free will is there in the spiritual world. Free will. Only Krishna has got absolute free will. We think I have got free will. I gave you example of free will. How long is a rope within that, you are free. Doesn't mean you are free forever. You can do what you want. The rope has given you that freedom. 100 feet circle, you can go what you want. As I told, I can, my desires are not, everything cannot. If I want to fly like a bird, I cannot. I am distinct. But here I can walk. I can go here. I can walk to a bar. I can walk to a gambling hall. I can walk to a temple. I can choose. In that I may be influenced. I will be influenced. That is why it says, depends on the association. Association influences your willing. Don't call it free will. Association influences your willing. In a computer, there is nobody sitting and willing.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Willing, only the Jeeva Shakti can will."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that only the Jeeva Shakti can will, and then the transcript becomes unclear.

Without willing, it is, program-wise it is responding. You put something on the screen, it responds. There is no willing there. Willing, only the Jeeva Shakti can will. Yeah, he can be free. I can only be free in that. No willing, only Brandon leave it to the agreement or the agreement to the agreement, what do we call it? In addition, any relation is a request. He cannot stoop this level, what do you call it? Hope of what? Hopelessness. Of course.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of utilizing lust, anger, and greed in the service of the Lord within Bhakti Yoga.

**Verse References:** BG 7.11
**Content Type:** philosophy

**Key Quote:** "When they are engaged in service of the Lord by a conditioned soul, it gets purified."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how material lust and anger can be purified through engagement in the service of the Lord, leading to freedom from these desires.

So, then how is this lust serving the Lord in the spiritual world? If the order of the Lord is there, He will purify it. Just like Krishna says, "I am sex life according to regulative principles." So, even though, that means it is a compromise. When material lust, material anger, material all these things are engaged in the service of the Lord by a conditioned soul, it gets purified. That means you become free from that lust. You become free from that anger.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That anger is coming out of his pure Bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the anger of a conditioned soul with the anger of a pure devotee, using Hanuman as an example, emphasizing that the latter stems from pure Bhakti.

So, this is different from pure devotees. An awakened person, he can also be angry. Hanuman was angry. That anger is not doubt-telling anger. That anger is coming out of his pure Bhakti.

### pure devotees, lust, divine forces, purpose
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/y3m5VxHCwYQ?t=89
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "but if you know the real purpose you can use that to untrap also"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the freedom of pure devotees from lust and how divine forces, including sex, can be used to liberate oneself if one understands their true purpose.

You understand? So that is different. A pure devotee's anger, everything is different. Of course, they are free from lust. Even like Bhaktivinoda Thakur says that if I can—but you know, Thakur or Bhaktis is not—but this is not so. If I can bring forth hundreds of pure devotees, I won't mind engaging in sex. Divine forces Krishna has made that to trap the living entities, correct? But if you know the real purpose, you can use that to untrap also.

## AAQ: Is Consciousness a Sign of the Soul or the Mind? | His Grace Madhu Pandit Dasa
**Speaker:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa

### consciousness, soul, mind, subtle body
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/_1oCAz9tFzE?t=0
**Verse References:** BG 13.6
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These two statements look like contradictory."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of whether consciousness is a symptom of the soul or the mind, noting apparent contradictions in Prabhupada's statements.

Bhagavad Gita 13.6.7. Symptoms of life also consist of the field of activity, and in the purport to this verse, Prabhupada writes, "The living symptoms represented by the consciousness and conviction are two manifestations of this subtle body, mind, ego, and intelligence." But doubt comes when we go further in this chapter. Prabhupada writes, "Consciousness as a symptom of the soul." These two statements look contradictory.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Similarly, the kshetra having the symptoms of life because soul is there, soul is like the spiritual current, spirit is there, therefore, this body can think, feel all the symptoms."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of electricity powering a fan or light to explain the relationship between the soul and the body, stating that the soul is the spiritual current that enlivens the body.

It is not. It is even symptoms of life; it is a field of activity. How to identify the knower of the field, the soul? What is the actual clue that there exists something called a soul? I am perturbed, Prabhupada. Please explain. The field of activity, a simple example I will give, based on that you understand. Electricity is driving this fan, electricity is driving this light. Cut off the electricity, everything seems to be there. Yes, the unseen is gone, okay. But I should not mistake electricity with the electrical wire. Electricity is not equal to the bulb, electricity is not equal to the light. A dead electrical wire and a live electrical wire, an electrified wire, is not equal to electricity. Electricity is flowing inside. Therefore, it is alive. Similarly, the kshetra having the symptoms of life because the soul is there, the soul is like

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Similarly, gross body and subtle body, manas, buddhi, ankara, they are like electrical wire."
**Summary:** Continuing the electricity analogy, the speaker compares the gross and subtle bodies (mind, intelligence, ego) to electrical wires, emphasizing that they are instruments through which the soul manifests.

the spiritual current, spirit is there, therefore, this body can think, feel all the symptoms. Just like when the electricity goes, the light goes away. So life is actually alive. It is alive. Actually, originally the sense, light is what, the spirit, it is simply, it is different from the equipment. Similarly, gross body and subtle body, manas, buddhi, ahankara, they are like electrical wire. Then the soul is connected to that. Then electricity is connected to the wire. So, this is the kshetra. This is the kshetra. Then you have the soul. The soul is connected to this kshetra, this body, gross body and subtle body, the symptom of life comes. But the symptom of life is not there if you take it away. A dead man has no symptom of life. So the symptom of life is coming from spirit. But in this world, it is manifest differently. This is the same for the kshetra. The kshetra, it is very different from the earth. A 100-watt bulb will give 100-watt light, a 20-watt will give 20-watt light. So you will mistake that the bulb is a giver of 20 watts. This bulb gives 20 watts, that bulb gives 20 watts, no. The same electricity, because of your filament, you are drawing 20 watts, other element is

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "You are the knower, knower means that awareness, that consciousness, but that consciousness is modified into various effects, conviction, this thing, that thing, different life symptoms."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of light passing through colored filters to illustrate how the soul's consciousness is modified by the material qualities (gunas) and the body.

drawing 100 watts. So another example, if they have white light, you put a green glass, green light will come, red light, red will come, blue light, blue will come. Now this filter, is it equal to the light? No. If you don't know there is a source of light behind, you will see, this blue light, Mr. Blue, Mr. Red, Mr. Green, it is just a filter. But it affects the, it modifies the white light. But light is from? Spirit. You understand, matter, ego, mind, intelligence, gross body, none of them will work without the spirit being connected to the soul. So therefore Krishna says, you are Kshetrajna. Kshetrajna. You are the knower, knower means that awareness, that consciousness, but that consciousness

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is soul's conviction modified."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the soul's conviction is modified by the gunas and the type of body, and uses the example of a lion mask to further illustrate how the material energy modifies life symptoms.

is modified into various effects, conviction, this thing, that thing, different life symptoms. It modifies for different persons, according to different types of bodies. If you have Sattva guna, your conviction will be modified accordingly. You are the knower. If you have Sattva guna, your conviction will be modified in a different way. That doesn't mean that it is the soul's conviction. It doesn't mean that it is the soul's this thing. It is the soul's conviction modified. Matter cannot have conviction. Matter cannot think without the spirit. Manas buddhi ahankara is not manas buddhi ahankara. I'll give you an example of ego. Pure white light is there, it's a little example. You put a lion mask in front of it, transparent, translucent. You go the other side. It's transparent. You go the other side. It's transparent. Translucent. Translucent. You will see the toe is a lion, the foot a monkey face, the toe is a monkey. So what is the mask doing? It is influencing and modifying. This is three gunas. It is modifying. Modifying life symptom, life energy, life modifying life.

### soul, ego, experience, sukha dukkha
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/_1oCAz9tFzE?t=478
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The soul is not there then there is nobody, there cannot be ahankara."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the soul is the basis of ego and experience, and that the soul is the experiencer of happiness and distress, even in dreams.

Just like the filter modifies pure light. Green, red, the modifier. It is a mold. The lion's face is a mold. I am the body is a mold. Plus me. I am the one who is associated with the body and saying I am the body. If the soul is not there, then there is nobody, there cannot be ahankara. There cannot be false ego without an ego behind it. You can go to a stage and play the drama role of a king on the stage. But who is playing the role? You. If you are not there then no drama player also. Right. Similarly, we are playing so many false egos. I am this body, everything. Who is this? It is all the soul is doing, but influenced by the material energy. Now we are trying to create pure influence. But whether influenced or uninfluenced, the experiencer of sukha dukkha is who? The soul. Whether in a dream or in real life, the experiencer of sukha dukkha in the story is who? You. In the dream, who is afraid? You only are afraid. Suffering. Who is suffering? Or who is enjoying in the dream? You only.

### kshetrajna, kshetra, experience, gunas, liberation
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/_1oCAz9tFzE?t=591
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "And the kshetra is a modifier, molder of your experience."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Kshetrajna (knower of the field) is the experiencer, while the Kshetra (field of activity) modifies the experience based on the gunas, and that liberation leads to experience influenced by spiritual nature.

So similarly, we, the kshetrajna is the knower and is the experiencer. And the kshetra is a modifier, a molder of your experience. If your sattva guna body, sattva guna mind, then your experience will be sattvic. If tamasic, then your experience will be tamasic. If you are liberated, then your experience is influenced by the higher nature, spiritual nature, vishuddha sattva. Any question on this? Remind me of my time. Go to the airport. The kshetra, doubt comes or no doubt comes, provisional. Actually, in relation to bhavadeesha and pralpa, our lives, our current consciousness reflects the matter. It has been light, light and death, it has been that. But for now, we have seen everything that matters. But how to, if a person is in darkness, who has never seen light? Then how will that happen, if there is something on his life?

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "First you intellectually understand that yes, there is light."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to develop faith and understand the soul, even without direct experience, using the example of the desire for youthfulness to illustrate the soul's inherent longing for permanency.

Krishna will show you light, correct? Correct? You are right. Without experience, little by little your faith will not increase. First you intellectually understand that yes, there is light. Intellectually. Intellectually means? I am trying but I did not input anything. No, I am telling you. Intellectually you can understand that I am struggling for permanency. But I see my body, my life, my everything is temporary. So intellectually you see that I am by nature seeking permanency. I don't want to die. I don't want to grow old. Do you want to grow old? Give a choice. One blessing I will give you. Please ask. If you want, I will give you a blessing. What is the blessing? Either I will tell you. You will always remain young or you will grow old. You know it is not possible. Therefore you are saying you don't. Suppose I have that power. You will say, Ajay Prabhu, give me. As long as I live, let me live young. I am not saying you will not die. But you will always be young. Better I am young always. I will take that boon. Nature does not allow. That is all. But what is your inner nature? Nature does not allow.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Even now when you are speaking, 99% you are soul only. Only 1% is body."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the confusion between the body and the soul, emphasizing that even in our current state, we are primarily the soul, and that the material aspect is only a reflection.

Nature does not allow. It is not possible to understand this. It is also possible to understand this. Art use motionless being. I understand you. Mine is like that though. Rest in peace. I am like this. I am like that. All that. I can understand why they gave us this. Yes, I am not this body. I am confusing my body person with the person. Person means spirit. You know the confusion comes more because even when we say I am saying some great thing. How to find the soul? Even now when you are speaking, 99% you are soul only. Only 1% is body. It is only reflecting. If you are reflecting, there has to be original. Correct? I don't even recognize that reflection is happening. I am only seeing that it is only there. There is no reflection. Like that I am feeling tender. Mentally is tenderly there. Even the material side is there. That's why they argue there is only matter.

### spiritual life, perception, chanting, senses, sattva

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When you chant Hare Krishna, your inner eyes will open."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that spiritual life involves a change in perception, and that chanting Hare Krishna and following regulative principles purify the senses, allowing one to see more than before.

Okay. Therefore, you should understand that spiritual life is such that even now you are perceiving everything like this. Just like now I say whatever I see like this. I am seeing. I am not seeing anything more. Suppose I am given new eyes. I see many more things. Right? So don't think your inner eyes now will remain the same. When you chant Hare Krishna, your inner eyes will open. Spiritual intelligence eyes will open. Then you will see much more than what you are seeing now. Now you are seeing a filtered world. Just like a dog can hear so many more frequencies. A dog can hear. I cannot hear so many frequencies. So your senses also become sharper. Your senses become sattvic. Only when your senses become sattvic, that is why unless you follow four regulative principles and all, your inner senses do not open. So your eyes become sattvic. Your ears become sattvic. Then you will see the truth, even relative truth. So it's not that you are the same and now you are seeing something I don't see. The world is not going to change. But forget about the world is not going to change. You are going to change. You are going to develop, specialize. Your senses are going to get purified. Purified. It will be able to see new frequencies, the frequency called bhakti frequency.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Pure devotee has got that bhakti frequency. He can see Krishna everywhere."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how a pure devotee, through devotion, develops the ability to see Krishna everywhere, and addresses the initial confusion about the symptoms of life being considered a field of activity.

A pure devotee has got that bhakti frequency. He can see Krishna everywhere. So when you say, how can a pure devotee see Krishna everywhere? You don't imagine, okay, like I see, he will see. No. He has developed eyes to see. Vemanjana bhakti vilocanena santa sadaiva hrudeshu vilokayanti. Eyes anointed with devotion makes him see Krishna everywhere. Krishna is everywhere but we cannot see. He is within and without everything. But when his eyes are anointed with the frequency of bhakti, he sees Krishna everywhere. Yes, sir. Before the age from the Buddha means after the significance of the Krishna, he says, Vatsa, Veda, Yata, Veda. Then he changed the class. Similarly, we change the body and get into another body. And Prabhupada also, Prabhupada will explain an old person, he will feel the same when he was in the childhood. With that Prabhupada will tell, yeah, there exists no lack of relationship. But there are also the symptoms. But when I read this verse, Prabhupada will take even the symptoms of life also as a field of activity. Confusion came. Then how we can take that example as a food for the soul? How we can take the changing body?

**Key Quote:** "Kshetrajna is not changing, Kshetra is changing."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of watching a movie to explain that the soul (Kshetrajna) remains constant while the body (Kshetra) and experiences change, and that the soul is the one reading the story from the patches of light on the screen.

No, correct. That example, changing bodies, is just to indicate that there is something which is not changing inside you. That example is only for that. Even now, there is something which is not changing inside. Kshetrajna is not changing, Kshetra is changing. Kshetrajna's experience is changing, Kshetra is not changing. The movie you watch is changing, but the movie seer is the same. I can sit in the same seat, morning to evening, watch five movies. I am not changing. My experience is changing. So conviction, life symptoms, all these things are the content of the movie. The content of the movie. Who is the seer of the movie? Me. The content of the movie is not experiencing. What is on the screen is only light patches. There is no hero, there is no heroine, nothing on the screen. Hero and heroine is here. I am mapping. I am reading the story out of the patches of light. What really exists is patches of light. So life, what is called life symptoms in this material world, they are only patches of light. The Kshetrajna is reading the story out of it.

It is all everywhere. But I did not hear. Now I can. Similarly, spiritual, spirit is everywhere. Krishna is everywhere. It requires spiritual eyes. That is why Prabhupada said, people are, can you show me God? Prabhupada used to ask, do you have the eyes to see God? No, I will learn. Okay. You are real determined to see God, I will tell you how to prepare your eyes. Chant Hare Krishna. Follow four regulative principles. Read Bhagavad Gita. Surrender to Krishna. You will get the eyes to see Krishna. 40京 100京

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the desire for glorification is a natural tendency derived from Krishna, but it is pervertedly reflected in the material world.

Another point, important point that Prabhupada is mentioning here is that it is a natural instinct for the Lord to hear and enjoy His personal glories. And because of this, each of us are an individual part and parcel of Krishna. We also have a tendency to feel what? Happy when somebody glorifies us.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of serving Krishna and feeling proud of choosing Krishna over Maya, while avoiding wrong praise and taking undeserved credit.

But this is asat in the material world, that is pervertedly reflected. In the spiritual world, the devotee also likes to be known in the eyes of the Lord, that He is happy with my service. And therefore when the Guru says, yes, you have done service, good service, then he also likes to hear that. Very good, you have distributed hundred Bhagavatam sets. Very good, Prabhupada says. You should enjoy that. Don't feel shy, it's your nature. Don't enjoy wrong praise. Don't seek wrong praise. Don't take credit for what you do not deserve. You deserve credit for choosing to serve Krishna than Maya. For your choice, that is rewarded, you should feel proud about it and you should expand that pride.

**Key Quote:** "There is nothing wrong in chasing after happiness, ananda."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the inherent desire for happiness (ananda) as a reflection of Krishna's nature, and the futility of seeking it without a connection to Krishna.

Pride, that I will never serve Maya, I will only serve Krishna. So Krishna's, we are amsa of Krishna. So it's the same tendency is there in us. We are amsa of Krishna, Krishna is sacchidananda, we are amsa, but our present. There is nothing wrong in chasing after happiness, ananda, but we are wrongly chasing. Because without Purna, without Krishna connection, there is no question of getting any strength. If I cut my fingers from the body, it will lose all its strength.

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada says misdirected love of Godhead is called lust."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a severed finger, the speaker explains that the soul, cut off from Krishna, still seeks fulfillment, and that misdirected love of Godhead manifests as lust in the material world.

Our current situation is like that. Even the cut fingers, still hungry for oxygen, blood, everything, doesn't stop. Of course, it's a very crude example. If it is one jiva, one finger is one jiva, cut off from the main, the Lord, that main connection with the Lord is function of devotional service. Gets cut off, then that soul will still, because nature is that, where is ananda, where is jiva? I don't want to die. So all the tendencies, we being part and parcel of Krishna, Krishna's nature is there in us, but it has to be properly redirected. Prabhupada says misdirected love of Godhead is called lust. Just see, lust is defined as misdirected love of Godhead. Your nature is to love God.

## AAQ: When Does Krishna Guide You to Your Guru? |His Grace Madhu Pandit Dasa
**Speaker:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa

### Krishna's guidance, Guru's role, Paramatma, Devotion, Material attachment

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Paramatma brings you to Guru and Guru takes you to Krishna."
**Summary:** Krishna, as Paramatma, monitors souls and guides those ready to give up material life to a Guru, who then trains them to realize Krishna.

You see, who comes into contact, who doesn't come into contact, that is arranged by Krishna, who is seated in the heart of the devotee. Every soul is germinating in this material world. Krishna is in your heart. Is this devotee still not fed up with this world? Does he want to come to me or not? Is he questioning what is life? All that Krishna is monitoring in the heart, Paramatma. So therefore, Paramatma, not destiny, Paramatma who knows your spiritual past, who knows your spiritual inclination, who knows how much you are fed up with this world, who knows whether this person is seeking for the truth beyond this illusion, whether this Atma is seeking for purpose of life, all that somebody is monitoring. Who is that? Paramatma. Paramatma takes you to Prabhupada. What is the use of Paramatma bringing you to Prabhupada? Somebody who is not ready to give up his material life and who is completely absorbed in illusion. When Prabhupada went to America, even though they were all very materialistic, these foreigners, they all had searched for truth. What is life? They all had this question. So right there, immediately Prabhupada planted the answers. Yes. So it is not that Prabhupada went to America and he touched everybody and only few became devotees. No. He didn't touch many. Millions of Americans are there. They don't even know who Prabhupada is. Right? So Krishna arranged some souls who are ready. It is said that Krishna brings one to Guru and Guru takes you to Krishna. Paramatma brings you to Guru and Guru takes you and trains you and makes you realize the Supreme Lord Krishna. That Krishna's one aspect is Paramatma. Vande krishnam jagat gurum vise. Who is that? It is the Supersoul. So Supersoul brings you to Guru, Guru brings you to Krishna. Why? Because you have to learn how to become a devotee. Somebody who is a devotee is the best person to teach you how to become a devotee, not God. God is not a devotee. God is receiver of devotee service. So God leaves that duty to the devotee.

You said that the perception of credits, one must have the right credits and take only what belongs to him. Perception of? The credit, how we see credit and how we take credit. So you said our transcendental credit is to Guru and Krishna. So how does a devotee see credits? Because we see that in our organization there are big devotees who have achieved a lot, like Akshaya Patra for example. So how do devotees handle credits without seeking Puja, Laba, or without accepting it as Pratishtha, or so it doesn't become an Anartha. So how should a devotee handle the credits that he gets?

Just like everybody in the material world, between this award, that award, they will also get awards.

Even if I don't know whether they are pleased or not, I am constantly seeking that. And I have faith because they have told that if you do this, I am pleased. So whether I am actually doing it properly, it's a different matter. But I am trying to do it properly. Let's say I chant Hare Krishna. If you chant Hare Krishna, Lord is pleased. So I am trying to do it properly. Let's say I chant Hare Krishna. Lord is pleased. But whether I am chanting offenselessly, that's another question. But the fact is that I am trying to chant offenselessly, yes, the Lord is pleased because Lord is pleased by trying to follow His instruction. So to please the Lord, to please the pure devotees of the Lord, to please the Vaiṣṇavas who are representing or representing the desires and wishes of a pure devotee. Yes.

**Summary:** The speaker advises devotees to ignore worldly rewards and the results of karma.

This is what he is seeing in reciprocation, I want to see this, not other rewards. So as far as all the other rewards are concerned, worldly rewards are concerned, or what the karmas come and give us, those things one should just, how can even, you know, all these things, you should just ignore them. You cannot even offer it to somebody, because if you want to offer something to somebody, that person should also like that, right? So it's the spirit of the devotee to offer everything to Guru, but whether the things that are offered by the people, by the karmis, whether they are offerable or not, it's a difference. It's a different matter.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that any credit received by a devotee is due to the mercy of Guru and Krishna and should be reinvested in the Lord's service.

But the spirit is, the devotee is saying that if at all in my service the Lord has given me some credit, it is due to the mercy of the Guru and Krishna, to be invested back in the service of the Lord. That is the perception of the devotee. The perception of the devotee who gets lot of money is not that I got lot of money, yes. Now his perception is how I can invest back in Lord's service. Here is something, some... Fame, recognition has come, his goal is now how to encash on that and reinvest it back in service of the Lord. Totally utility point of view, what you get.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how devotees within the community should appreciate each other's service, recognizing that Krishna is the ultimate doer.

It is nothing transcendental about that, the material awards and that you get here in this material world. Now as far as between, within the community of devotees, the devotee's duty is to appreciate the other devotee's service to the Lord, service to Krishna. But when he is appreciating that service, he is not appreciating the Lord. He is not appreciating the service to Krishna, he is not appreciating his ability. Please understand, devotees have crossed all that platform. Because Krishna, he knows, I am the ability in man, Krishna has said. The Lord is doing it. But you give credit, you glorify a devotee for having been an instrument in the hands of the Lord for whatever that you are doing, whether that instrument has come because you are pure or not pure, it is a different matter. But you are an instrument. A neophyte can also do a big service. The Lord may encourage him to do a very big service, but doesn't mean that it is pure devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "Because ultimately Lord has got unlimited reasons why a neophyte is made to do big service sometimes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the Lord can use even a neophyte for big service for various reasons, including the burning away of anarthas.

So just see how these are also various things, material measurements of how big service, small service is all, you cannot, can be very misleading. Because ultimately Lord has got unlimited reasons why a neophyte is made to do big service sometimes. To keep him in devotion service, to feed his anartha so that it burns away in a regulated way, in devotion service to burn it, he may do it, it is left to the Lord. And consistently if somebody has to serve the Lord, and that is a different thing, that is Shakti Avesh Avatara, like Prabhupada. The Lord Shakti is in him. Where he does big, big, big, big things. Not big because it is big. It is big because there is a big mission of the Lord here in this world. The Lord is waiting to empower the servants of the Lord with his power to do big things.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between a Krishna conscious and a Maya conscious approach to doing big things, using an example of a devotee wanting to build a skyscraper.

So there is a Krishna conscious perspective to doing big things in this world and by the, among the devotees, but there is also a Maya consciousness of doing big things among the devotees. So everywhere the consciousness is important. We need to understand with the right spirit. Not doing all, doing all big, big things for Krishna is Krishna consciousness. No. It can be Krishna conscious or it can be in your head, it could be completely Maya also. I always give this example, a new devotee joins, he says, yes, you should think of doing big, big things for the Lord. You cannot stop me. I want to build a skyscraper in the middle of the Indian Ocean. I want to build a skyscraper in the middle of the Indian Ocean. I want to build a skyscraper in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The temple president says, you are mad. Prabhu, what is the principle? When I am thinking for Lord Krishna, you are telling I am mad. What kind of representative of Krishna are you? You will say, no, you, there is a process. This is your anarttha. This is your desire to do. It's all doesn't go so easily.

You will not, when you read Prabhupada doing big things in the neo-faith, oh my God, he achieved with penniless, he built that. These are all good for karmis. This kind of glory is penniless. Prabhupada was, so many people penniless have become multi-billionaires in this world. Yes or not? Without nothing, they have built an empire. Is that the glory of Prabhupada? The glory of Prabhupada is that his service to his, whatever he did was pure devotional service to the Lord. That is that, what he, who was the beneficiary of that doing? That is what makes Prabhupada great. So many people have started penniless and made billions for themselves. Prabhupada started penniless and made billions for Sankirtana movement.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that only with Krishna's energy (shakti) can one truly serve Krishna and that Prabhupada was empowered by this shakti.

That is what the difference is. And that is Krishna Shakti. Only with Krishna Shakti, you can do seva for Krishna. Does not allow big services like that. Only by Krishna Shakti, you can do it. So he is Shakti of a Shavatara. Shakti of Lord Krishna has come into him. Then he is able to do that. That means he is able to become an instrument. Become an instrument for Lord Shakti to come inside and do all these things. So we need to. So when you read, initially we may get excited because we also say, Okay, okay, nothing Prabhupada had, he did all that. It is a devotional service also because you are appreciating Prabhupada. But should not think that is what it is. Therefore, I can also do something like this. So these are all material ambitions comes. These are not the inner consciousness of a pure devotee. I want to be like Prabhupada. Means you have to understand his heart and be like Prabhupada in his heart.

Those who desire independent existence, for them this Maya world is created. But that is only His desire. That is not His constitutional position.

Now it is all merged, but it becomes very clear that this body is excluded from the I. And that realization that I have no birth, no death, I am eternal, that becomes a natural realization of oneself. That also changes that person's because of this flow of Satya energy, he starts seeing all people also being in forgetfulness but they are actually not the body, they are their eternal self. Such a self in this material world, all enacting as different body persons, in maya, he sees that. He starts seeing not only his self as different from the body, he sees other selves as different from their bodies but trapped in the bodily concept of life, engaged in this maya drama.

We live life as if we don't die. We live life as if we are not going to grow old. The reality is different. You will grow old, you will die, everything. But we will be in illusion. That is called asat achitta and jadananda. The sense pleasures are equal to pleasure of the soul. Jadananda. Whereas our real ananda is satya chitta ananda. Not jada ananda.

In spite of all the weaknesses. In spite of all the fall downs. Overarching protection of the Lord is there.

There will be all kinds of obstacles just like any other institution building. All those obstacles will be there. But here, we don't deal with those obstacles on our own. Neither we carry that burden on our head too much. We leave it to the Lord and execute our devotional service. And He gives the intelligence to deal with such problems. See that includes the loving kindness, the love for the Lord, the prayers, the prayers of sacred leaders and the prayers of the devotees. All that He gives to the devotees. And the paradigms of the devotees. This is also predicated on us. All our good deeds shall be inculcated in the sense of our actions. And we have to work and work and work. That shall be the right way. The path of the devotees is not a path of truth. The path of the devotees is a path of faith. And the path of the devotees is a path of ance.

buddhi yoga. Our buddhi gets connected with Krishna's buddhi. All the obstacles are there. It will be there. You will cross over by His mercy.

How in 40 years, 35 years, 35 years, not a single instance where we had to face shortage of, particularly you can say, saksha. No. And never we have had any arrangement of some security. Even today we don't have any such a big temple as to run. People can't believe how it is possible. How next month's electricity bill will come, how next month's clean how you will maintain, how salaries will come. So the Lord is maintaining. With your own eyes you can see. See if you want, you need to have eyes to see this. This is not Shraddha. This is not simply Shraddha. It is a fact. Devotees experience that. It is a fact that the Lord provides.

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada had his plan. When I joined in 80s and all there is no brand in India. Nobody knows."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Prabhupada's visionary plan to establish Krishna consciousness, highlighting the importance of his books as a lasting foundation.

Otherwise we cannot see long. We cannot see tomorrow even. Jeeva cannot see one day ahead. A visionary means truly he should be able to see long. In the material world actually even people who achieve something, they say he is a visionary. By chance he got what visionary is. Because of his karma the super soul knew the vision. He will reach there. So after reaching there he will say, I am a visionary. Otherwise it is... Krishna is a visionary. Prabhupada is a visionary. Prabhupada had his plan. When I joined in 80s and all there is no brand in India. Nobody knows. If at all they know something, something to do with hippies in America. I know that standing, that prestige. Now you go to the government offices. You say he is gone. They will stand up. In those days, who is this fellow? Now Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir by all this he has a master plan. How to consolidate this Krishna consciousness movement for future generations. During his time he laid the big foundation which is his books. All other foundations may go away. When there is a flood all the foundation will go away. Temples will fall down also. But this foundation of his books will stay.

**Key Quote:** "Only one message. Chant Hare Krishna and be happy."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the simplicity of Lord Chaitanya's message - to chant Hare Krishna and be happy - and the power of the holy name to bestow spiritual energy and bliss.

So the super foundation he has built. Now it all depends on all his disciples. From different angles. From different directions to build up the foundation. The foundation of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's movement. It is a great gift for the world. It is a saving grace for the world. And such a simple process. Just chant Hare Krishna. To tell everybody just chant Hare Krishna we have to build a big VCM and this and that. Only one message. Chant Hare Krishna and be happy. But telling that we have to do all this. And so much so that sometimes we forget the essence is chanting Hare Krishna. We get lost into so many things. I am not happy Prabhu. Prabhupada told chant Hare Krishna and be happy. It is left to you to be happy. Chant Hare Krishna and be happy. That's all. Rest is all. Unhappiness is created by the mind. So this is just like you see Bhagavatam says. Lord lotus feet of Vishnu is worshipped. All things happen. Similarly the lotus feet Nama Prabhu. If the Nama Prabhu is worshipped by the population. By small percent of the population. All auspiciousness will flow into this. Automatically. Nama Nama Kari Baudha Nija Sarva Shakti. Already out. All the Shakti is there. Anybody accidentally chants Hare Krishna also Shakti is there. It flows. Spiritual Shakti is there. Sat Chitta Nananda

**Key Quote:** "There is no difference between Krishna and His name."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that unlike material beings, Krishna's name, form, and personal aspects are non-different from Him, highlighting Krishna's unlimited nature.

Unlike our name and ourselves, in the case of Krishna, the Absolute, there is no difference between Krishna and His name. Just like you say, if you see Krishna's form, you will say, Oh, this is Krishna. You won't separate. The form is something, Krishna is something. Just as Krishna's form is Krishna, the same way Krishna's name is Krishna. This you have to understand. Not only Krishna's name is Krishna, everything connected to Krishna, Krishna's personal aspect of Krishna, is Krishna Himself. So, the Supreme Lord has Nama, Rupa, Leela, Guna, all these things, just like we have. We have Rupa. We have Sharira. Sharira is Rupa. We have a name. We have a mind. We have intelligence. The same way, Krishna is a person. So, Krishna also has, we have one name. Krishna has unlimited names. We have one body. Krishna has unlimited bodies. We have one form. Krishna has unlimited forms. We have limited mind. Krishna has got unlimited mind. We have limited intelligence. Krishna has got unlimited intelligence. This is the difference. Krishna is also a person. We are also persons. God is a person.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna and Krishna's name is not different."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the difference between Krishna and humans, explaining that Krishna's body (Sharira) is His soul (Atma), unlike humans where they are distinct.

We are also persons. Now, this difference, Nama, Nami, Abhinatva, Krishna and Krishna's name is not different. That is another difference between us and Krishna. We have a Sharira. Our Sharira is not our Atma. But in Krishna's case, his Sharira is his Atma. Atma is his Sharira. His name is him. He is his name and name is him. He is his form and form is him. This Tattva is called Advaya Jnana. Advaya, anything directly connected to Krishna, there is no duality. Now my body is connected to me, but there is duality. I am not the body. Janma Karma Chame Divyam Yo Ovidyati Tattvata Hatha Ekta Degham Punar Janma Neiti Maa Meiti Soarjuna. This is the secret. If one knows God is a person, I am a person, what kind of a different person he is than me. This is Krishna Tattva.

**Key Quote:** "This Shabda is Krishna himself who has appeared before me."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the sound of the holy name (Shabda) is Krishna Himself, addressing potential doubts about how a sound produced by the tongue can be Krishna.

So when we do our Japa, most important thing that we have to know in the background is that this Shabda is Krishna himself who has appeared before me. Now the question may arise. No, but this Shabda I am creating with my tongue. Does it mean that I create Krishna? If I chant, then Krishna is there. If I don't chant, Krishna is there. Not there. And also I am just vibrating. It is a material vibration. So Krishna is the owner of all these energies. So how is it that this sound is Krishna?

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's Shuddha Nama is Krishna himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Nama Avatara, where Krishna enters the sound of His name, clarifying that Krishna doesn't incarnate into the sound but manifests within it.

For that we have to understand that Krishna's Shuddha Nama is Krishna himself. In the spiritual world, Krishna is there. Krishna is Rupa. He is Nama. Everything is. Just mind. Everything is there. He is a full-fledged personality with unlimited, as I told you, unlimited names, unlimited forms, etc. That is the Supreme Lord. He is the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world. So when we say Nama Avatara, this Nama that we utter, Krishna enters this sound. Krishna's Nama of the spiritual world enters this sound that we utter. And as far as Krishna is concerned, just like we are spirit souls, we enter this body. When we enter this body, our body is separate, I am separate. In the case of Krishna, he never incarnates into anybody, whether it is a sound produced by you, or whether it is a marble deity, or a metal deity. Krishna being the source of everything, being the source of that external vigraha, being the source of that, all the external energy, being the source of that, we should consider that sound to be as good as Krishna. He is Krishna himself. If he decides, I am this vigraha, then it is Krishna himself. He decides, it's my energy, it remains his energy.

**Key Quote:** "He is Krishna himself."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between an uninstalled and installed deity, explaining that in the latter, Krishna manifests His energetic nature, emphasizing that Krishna reciprocates based on surrender.

Energetic and energy. What is the difference between uninstalled deity and installed deity, or worshipable deity and showcase external vigraha? In one, is only Krishna's energy. In another, the energetic also has entered that vigraha. Energy and energetic is never separated. But Krishna manifests his energetic nature in the vigraha. Krishna is everywhere. Krishna is there in everything. This is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Achintya Veda Veda Tatva. There is no thing, there is no place, there is no situation where God is not present. But being present is one thing, His reciprocation is another thing. He reciprocates according to the principle of as you surrender, I reciprocate. The scriptures have revealed that nam nam akari bahudha nija sarva shakti that all the shaktis, Krishna's personal shakti comes into the nama. This is nama avatara. So, the moment the Lord decides to enter the sound, shakti avesha, enter the sound that you utter, that sound, you should have faith that Krishna is Himself dancing on my tongue. He is Almighty Lord. Being in the spiritual world, still He comes down on my tongue.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting is done to worship the Nama Avatara, take association, and become liberated from the miseries and modes of material nature, emphasizing Krishna's presence.

And why, especially on the order of the Guru, why do we chant? We chant to worship this nama avatara and take association from this nama avatara and become liberated from this miseries of this material world. Become liberated from the three modes of material nature. So, that is the truth about this sound Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Hare Hare So, don't worry that oh, I am producing this sound, how it can be Krishna? Krishna, He becomes that. To touch you, to give you association, He becomes that. So, therefore, in nama japa, the most fundamental, minimum bhavana is sriddha bhavana. Only if we have this bhavana, then we will not convert our japa into a mechanical japa. So, otherwise, we think that japa is just some process, finish sixteen rounds. But in reality, Krishna is coming down to relate with us, to give us association, to give us realization that He is present before us. Give us realization that He is this Samudra, He is the Surya

of Satchidananda. Our soul is always craving for Satchidananda. And He is the Surya of Satchidananda. So, Srila Prabhupada has given us this secret. Now, how to worship the Nama Avatara? Nama Avatara is a fact. Just like one sun reflects on different water bodies. Similarly, Nama Prabhu in the form of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Hare Hare reflects His presence onto each of our tongues. So, the most expansive Avatara of the Lord is this Kali Yuga. In this Kali Yuga, He is Nama Prabhu in the form of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. If Krishna comes before you, what all would you do in a right manner? If God comes before you, what all you should do, what all you will do in the right manner? I say right manner because no real person can be dealt with according to your own whims. So this is the supreme personality of Godhead. What should be my consciousness when God comes before me?

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna incarnates to receive worship and enter our consciousness, emphasizing the purpose of Nama Avatara is to extract our soul from the complicated mess of material existence and bodily identification.

The supreme personality of Godhead. I should know the situation, the situation in my background, that Krishna has incarnated to receive my worship and to enter my ear holes. And to touch my mind and touch my heart by hearing the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. So for the worship to be complete, for the Nama Avatara to be pleased. Suppose I come to your house for something. If you fulfill that, then I will be very happy. Similarly Nama Avatara is coming on your tongue for a purpose. Because every living entity is his child. Every living entity in the material world is suffering. This is not our real life. So his coming down, his purpose of coming down as a Nama Avatara, just like a magnet. There are so many iron filings, big magnet comes and all the iron filings get attracted to it and you pick out and place the iron filings somewhere else. Similarly Nama Avatara, the purpose of coming off our tongue is to extract our soul from this complicated mess. To extract our soul from out of this body, out of this bodily concept. Extract our soul from false ego.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Lord desires a soul free from false ego and that chanting and hearing are pleasing to the Lord because it serves the purpose of liberation.

Okay. The Supreme Lord loves every soul and he wants every one of us desperately. But he wants a false ego free soul. He wants the soul, not the false ego. The false ego is ignorance. Ignorance can be contracted by knowledge. And Krishna Shakthiya Vaishanama Avatara is a reservoir of Shuddha, Nama, Shuddha, Shuddha, Jnana, Vijjana. Nama Prabhu is Jnana Vijjana Surupa, Satchidananda Surupa. So therefore by hearing the Hare Krishna Maham. The Nama Prabhu is very pleased. Oh! Now He is associating with me. He is taking advantage of my going all the way onto his tongue. He is not chanting in vain. Chanting in vain. Convain means taking very little benefit of chanting. Chanting and hearing is very pleasing to the Lord because it serves the purpose.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the benefits of understanding the essence of japa, emphasizing Prabhupada's order to chant 16 rounds and how knowing the philosophy helps avoid offenses.

So go on doing good japa, no more life. Even this life is completely guided, protected, provided for, engaged in His service simply by this worship of the holy name of the Lord. So anyone who understands this essence, their Prabhupada has given us an order to chant 16 rounds, 16 into 108 times. Worship this Nama Avatara. Background, know the purpose, worship. Background, have the desire, it's for pleasing each Nama Prabhu. Then what can be better than daily associating with Krishna Himself? We don't feel that association of Krishna because of the offences in japa. And knowing the philosophy of Krishna consciousness, most of the 10 offences described in Padma Purana, are avoided by the devotees. Because they don't consider the demigods or anybody equal to the Supreme Lord. All these things, to learn the philosophy of Krishna consciousness, that this worshipping the holy name is not some ritualistic punya activity. It's a ritual. All this we know, so we avoid all these offences.

**Key Quote:** "The holy name is so powerful, all sins are happening because of ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker identifies the two main offenses in chanting as blaspheming devotees and inattentive chanting, explaining that sins arise from ignorance and the holy name is merciful and powerful enough to wipe out sinful tendencies.

Only two offences we are vulnerable to. One is to blaspheme the devotees. Another is inattentive chanting. And inattentive chanting comes because, inattentive chanting, if one does not follow the regulatory principles, it's very difficult to attentively chant. If you have to worship the holy name of the Lord, better and better, we should be free from all sins. No doubt. The holy name is so powerful. All sins are happening because of ignorance. Because we do not know what is our true welfare. For some immediate pleasure, we think that is my real welfare. And we perform sins, sinful activities. And that, since ignorance is a root cause of that, even if you're chanting without being free from sins, very soon if you hear and chant, then sin, sinful habits, plus soul's sinful tendency will all get wiped out. That's good for you? So merciful is the Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. So the greatest treasure that we all have is this holy name.

**Key Quote:** "This treasure is God Himself."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the holy name is the greatest treasure, which is God Himself, and the quality of japa depends on the quality of the background feeling, explaining the difference between conscious and background mind.

The greatest treasure should be kept very carefully, served very carefully, related with very carefully. It is not an impersonal treasure, somebody gives you treasure, whole box of jewellery, this that. This treasure is God Himself. So therefore how much? So Prabhupada says you chant sixteen rounds and serve this Nama Mathara everyday. Prabhupada says the quality of japa depends upon the quality of the background feeling. The quality of the background is the differences of foreground mind and background mind and subconscious mind. Now I am speaking to you, you are hearing. That is your conscious mind is hearing. In the background mind you are passively relating what you are hearing with what all you know. That means your background is hearing everything in a context. Context that you are hearing the speaker, the context that what is the subject matter of hearing. These are all contexts. Background mind is a context mind. Background mind is a relating mind.

**Key Quote:** "Background mind should always be in the context of japa."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the background mind should be focused on the context of japa, such as shraddha, the purpose of japa, or feelings of priti, to avoid mechanical chanting.

It is through the background mind with which you relate with what you do in the foreground mind. If your background mind is solving some problem and thinking of this problem, feeling some problem, and you are chanting in the foreground mind, then the chanting will become mechanical. So background mind should always be in the context of japa. Whether it is Shraddha, whether it is remembering the purpose of japa, whether you are remembering the golden command, or whether you want to offer feelings of priti for each bead in reciprocation to realizing how much priti he has in coming to me, descending on my tongue, or it can be Aghlada, feeling great elation that God is before me. Feeling so grateful that Lord has come before me from the depth of the heart, cry out to him with gratitude. You have learnt so many things from Prabhupada's books. What is surrender? God has come before you. Practice that now. Surrender to him. With your bhavana, sharnagati bhavana. Shraddha bhavana. Aghlada javana. Hrithpurvaka bhavana.

**Summary:** The speaker encourages building up enthusiasm and feeling pleasure with each chanting, emphasizing the importance of humility and chanting with an egoism freed from false egoism.

Utsaha bhavana. Enthusiastically build up. Each chanting of the Hare Krishna, you should think you have earned the pleasure of Krishna. Utsaha means how to earn more and more, how to become more and more wealthy, how to become spiritually richer and richer, one more pleasure giving to Nama Prabhu, one more pleasure giving to Nama Prabhu. This bhavana in the background, with this bhavana in the background, you do the tasking. Tasking means building up the number of sevas. You should know that not only you are counting the number of japa, Krishna is also counting your number of japa. As you finish one mala, he is waiting for the next mala. Okay, one he has finished, take one more. Because Krishna wants nirantara smaranam. Krishna wants smaranam. The next better, more pleasing to me is nirantara smaranam. Satatam ananyas chintayantoma. Krishna becomes conquered. Which is very tough, but we can practice. To finish sixteen rounds without thinking of anything, but chanting and hearing and feeling that this is Krishna, feeling ahalada, krithurvaka japa, feeling utsaha, feeling sharanagati, feeling krithajna, recognizing He is my protector, bharta patra, nakshapatra, feeling self humility, egoism, insignificant servant egoism. Chanting with the egoism, which is freed from false egoism.

**Key Quote:** "Every card is a relationship with the holy name."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the use of cue cards to meditate on the glory of the Lord and develop feelings associated with japa, explaining how repeated contemplation can transform thoughts into feelings.

So all these are, these cue cards that have been made are meant for two things. One is for us to read that, other than japa time. Meditate on the glory of the Lord. Every card is a relationship with the holy name. And, these cards are first a thought. Let's say somebody doesn't know who is Krishna. So if you tell him Krishna is supreme personality of God, it's only a thought. He hears many many many times. Just like we have heard so many times. This fact that Krishna is supreme personality of Godhead. So it has become a feeling. When we say Krishna is supreme personality of Godhead, it becomes a feeling. Bhavana. In the same way, all these bhavanas associated with japa. Number one, first these cards are meant for repeated reading. You repeatedly read them for six months, one year. Then afterwards you don't have to read. They would have become feelings related with the holy name. For instance, Krishna is Krishna's name himself. It is Krishna himself. So it becomes a feeling. Now Krishna is here. So the card, after that state, card acts as a trigger to the bhavana that is gone into your subconscious by repeated contemplation

**Key Quote:** "Good japa is chanting, hearing, feeling the Nama Prabhu."
**Summary:** The speaker draws an analogy with anger to explain how feelings are connected to thoughts, emphasizing that good japa involves feeling the relationship with Nama Prabhu and synchronizing the foreground and background minds for concentration.

on the thoughts associated with these feelings. Just like an angry person, behind the anger there is a thought that causes the anger. There is a reason, there is a thought that causes the anger. But when you are angry, you don't remember the thought, you don't think the thought. You feel the thought. So in the same way, good japa is thinking, sorry, chanting, hearing, feeling the Nama Prabhu. Feeling the relationship with Nama Prabhu. Feeling about Nama Prabhu. Feelings offered to Nama Prabhu. Feeling the feelings that Nama Prabhu has towards us. So if these feelings are in the background, you will connect it to Nama. Who is in the foreground? Foreground. This feeling is about whom? Feeling is about the Nama Avatara who is appearing on each bead. It is not that foreground mind is going one direction and background mind is feeling. No. Background and foreground mind works in a synchronized manner. Just like now you are listening to me, your foreground mind, background mind is synchronized. When it is synchronized, that is concentration. Then that is giving full attention. Artificially try to bring attention back, bring attention back, bring attention back. How long you will go? It is very tiring for the mind. So if you do groundwork for it, if you have support of your background mind, chanting becomes beautiful. Chanting will never become mechanical. That is soulful japa.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces a method for practicing soulful japa, involving locking attention through anusarana, sankalpa, and experiencing divya cheshta shakti from the nama, leading to ruchi and ease in chanting.

So we have devised this method of practicing this. For one year, two years you practice, rest of the life you take your first mala, first you lock your attention through anusarana, golden command, feel that I should seva by seva, distinct seva, feel saviour on each bead. All these things, the first mala you, and then you set the, you lock the attention through sankalpa, that I will hear, and vikalpa that I will not, I will not think. So the first mala locks the attention on chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing. How it gets locked? The shakti to lock. What is the, what, the mind gets dragged away by so many things. So you have to control the mind to lock. But we only struggle first round, deliberately, with faith that the shakti to control the mind is in the nama. Divya cheshta, what you are doing is a divya cheshta, is a divine effort. So divine effort, you get divya cheshta shakti from nama. And this can be really experienced. How beautifully the attention gets locked to chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing. No, nothing else comes in the mind. If divya cheshta shakti is flowing into our heart, and it flows into our heart, we will feel no struggle, in doing the japa, we will feel that ruchi, that sense of ease with which we chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare,

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of moving a finger through air versus paint to illustrate the smoothness achieved with divya cheshta shakti, explaining the importance of anusvarna, arthavat, vidivat, and uninterrupted chanting.

Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. If you move your finger in some paint, or in honey, like this, you will find lot of resistance, no? You move your finger in the air, no resistance. When you get divya cheshta shakti, your chanting and hearing will be like this, in the air. Smoothly, mind will not disturb. Otherwise mind will drag. So mala one, anusvarna arthavat vidivat. Anusvarna means obedience to golden command. Arthavat means purposeful. Whenever any activity we do with a, we load the purpose in the background, then there will be focus. Your purpose should not be routine finishing of sixteen rounds. To understand the purpose is worshipping nama on each bead. So arthavat means purposeful. Vidivat, Guru has told exactly what is the vidhi. Chant distinctly, hear clearly, the very same chant is a vidhi. And, to uninterruptedly chant. Uninterrupted means uninterrupted by any other doing. Japa time means japa doing, not any other doing. You can kirtaniya sadahari, you can chant, you are cooking, you chant while driving, all that you can do, extra. But you have to chant sixteen rounds, without doing anything else. Without solving, trying to engage your mind in solving this problem, that problem, thinking about what I should do today, this, that, all these things. That is something else. This exclusively doing for Krishna. So that is a vidhi.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how practicing these principles can train the mind and make it a habit to lock attention on chanting, emphasizing the importance of shraddha and understanding the philosophy to develop the right bhavana.

All these things you practice, it goes into your subconscious mind. And afterwards, it naturally, it becomes your second nature to lock the attention. Just like now it has become a habit for us to chant and do some thinking. In the same way, it becomes a habit that you cannot think of anything else. Chanting and hearing, chanting and hearing becomes a habit. The mind can be trained. So Shraddha is a second mala. As I told, it's a basic Shraddha that Krishna is present before me. Another point of Shraddha is, Krishna is pleased by my chanting. To get that realization, He is pleased, you have to understand the philosophy, you have to understand the background, that bhavana to come, you have to understand the reasons behind it. Then Preeti japa, Hrithpurvaka japa, Agalatha japa, I have repeated this in every, I'm not repeating it now.

**Summary:** This segment introduces the importance of a bona fide spiritual master in guiding individuals towards Krishna Consciousness by imparting instructions through oral reception.

OM NAMO BHAGWATE VASUDEVAYA. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 22, Text 7. I have fortunately been instructed by you and thus great favor has been bestowed upon me. I thank God that I have listened with open ears to your pure words. Srila Rupa Goswami has given directions in his Bhakti Rasamita Sindhu on how to accept a bona fide spiritual master and how to deal with him. First, the desiring candidate must find a bona fide spiritual master and then he must very eagerly receive instructions from him and execute them. This is reciprocal service. A bona fide spiritual master or saintly person always desires to elevate a common man who comes to him because everyone is under the delusion. Because everyone is under the delusion of Maya and is forgetful of his prime duty, Krishna Consciousness, a saintly person always desires that everyone become a saintly person.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes receiving transcendental messages through oral reception from a spiritual master, who guides individuals to perform duties in Krishna Consciousness according to their abilities, referencing Arjuna's service as a military man.

It is the function of a saintly person to invoke Krishna Consciousness in every forgetful common man. Manu said that since he was advised and instructed by Kardamma Muni, he was very much favoured. He considered himself lucky to receive the message by oral reception. It is especially mentioned here that one should be very inquisitive to hear with open ears from the authorized source of the bona fide spiritual master. How is one to receive? One should receive the transcendental message by oral reception. The word, Karnarandhraja, means through the holes of the ears. The favour of the spiritual master is not received through any other part of the body but the ears. This does not mean, however, that the spiritual master gives a particular type of mantra through the ears in exchange for some dollars and if the man meditates on that, he achieves perfection and becomes God within six months. Such reception through the ears is bogus. The real fact is that the bona fide spiritual master knows the nature of a particular man and what sort of duties he can perform in Krishna Consciousness and he instructs him in that way. He instructs him through the ear not privately but publicly, you are fit for such and such work in Krishna Consciousness, you can act in this way. One person is advised to act in Krishna Consciousness by working in the deity's room. Another is advised to act in Krishna Consciousness by performing editorial work. Another is advised to do preaching work. And another is advised to carry out Krishna Consciousness in the cooking department. There are different departments of activity in Krishna Consciousness and a spiritual master, knowing the particular ability of a particular man, trains him in such a way that by his tendency to act, he becomes perfect. Bhagavad Gita makes it clear that one can attain the highest perfection of spiritual life simply by offering service according to his ability, just as Arjuna served Krishna by his ability in the military art.

**Summary:** This segment highlights the importance of receiving instructions from the spiritual master and faithfully executing them to achieve spiritual perfection, emphasizing the disciple's duty and the expert guidance of the spiritual master.

Arjuna offered his service fully as a military man and he became perfect. Similarly, an artist can attain perfection simply by performing artistic work under the direction of the spiritual master. If a man is a literary man, he can write articles and poetry for the service of the Lord under the direction of the spiritual master. One has to receive the message of the spiritual master in order to be perfect. spiritual master regarding one's capacity for the spiritual master is expert in giving such instructions. This combination, the instruction of the spiritual master and the faithful execution of the instruction by the disciple makes the entire process perfect. Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur describes in his explanation of the verse in Bhagavad Gita, that one who wants to be certain to achieve spiritual success must take the instruction from the spiritual master as to what his particular function is. He should faithfully try to execute that particular instruction and should consider that his life and soul. The faithful execution of the instruction by the disciple is the best way to achieve spiritual success. The faithful execution of the instruction which he receives from the spiritual master is the only duty of a disciple and that will bring him perfection. One should be very careful to receive the message from the spiritual master through the ears and execute it faithfully. That will make

The favor he received by listening to instructions from Haridavamuni. So this is a process of spiritual elevation. This is a process of spiritual growth. This is the process of liberation from material energy. What is the process? The process is oral reception. You have to hear from authorized source.

**Summary:** This segment describes Krishna consciousness as direct reception of transcendental words, explaining how material intellect acts as a barrier and how faith and oral reception are crucial for attaining transcendental intelligence.

transcendental consciousness, just by hearing. It is not the path of Krishna consciousness. Krishna consciousness, ultimately, is a path of direct reception of the words that emanate from the transcendental platform. Direct reception, without the interference by our material intellect. The material intellect is like a shutter. It opens that shutter. This material intellect, a shutter always stops light, isn't it? In a camera, a shutter stops light. As far as spiritual bhakti is concerned, when you compare it with the process of receiving transcendental words from the spiritual master, receiving transcendental sound, the material speculative intelligence is like a shutter. It has to be opened up. What does that mean? First, one should have faith that the shabda, that the words that emanate from a pure devotee, has God, the knowledge is God, is contained within that. The intelligence to understand those words are also contained within that. You only have to receive transcendental intelligence. Your material intelligence gets purified by transcendental intelligence. Material intelligence cannot lead us to transcendental intelligence.

Only oral reception can lead us to transcendental intelligence. By receiving oral, by oral reception of transcendental facts and transcendental intelligence, which is contained in those words, the Shakti is there in those, the transcendental knowledge Shakti or Vidya Shakti is there in that transcendental words. This is a very mystical process. We don't understand, we don't try to understand Bhaktivedanta Parpat. Like a college professor tries to understand, like a philosophy professor tries to understand Prabhupada's books. This is not the way we understand, we read. Okay? It simply purifies one. By hearing, hearing, hearing, it simply purifies one. The moment the intellectual shatter comes, then everything becomes stale. The moment the intellectual shatter, you take Bhagavad Gita as it is, go on reading, parpatu parpatu, go on reading. I used to do this, first when I got Bhagavad Gita. It was so nice. Intellect stopped working. Page after page, what took, going on, went on reading, reading, and reading, and reading. Wanted to read the parpats and not trying to memorize, not trying to assimilate, not nothing. Going on, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, surrender to Krishna,

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the power of submissive hearing and repeated reception of transcendental knowledge, contrasting it with the limitations of material intelligence in achieving spiritual advancement.

you are servant of Krishna, surrender to Krishna, you are servant of Krishna. Suppose the intellect had come in between. Arrey, this I already know, he already told once. I am servant of Krishna, he has told once, I already know. Again he is saying, I am servant of Krishna, I already know. See, intellect means it ends there. Moment you know it ends there. But moment you have submissive hearing, thousand times you hear Prabhupada saying, you are servant of Krishna, each time is bliss. Each time it gives energy. Thousand times you hear Krishna is supreme personality of Godhead, each time it gives you energy. But as far as fact is concerned, it is only one bit of fact. What is that? Krishna is supreme personality of Godhead. But each time you read, read, read, every time you hear, you get transcendental. This is a very big secret for spiritual advancement. You have to understand that your, it is not, your real advancement doesn't come from your material buddhi. Sometimes we are all very overconfident about our material intelligence, our rational intelligence. It is very limited. It is a very limited chapter. It is a way of growth. It is a starting way of growth of spiritual life. Because we are stuck in our intelligence, we have to purify our intelligence. We have to try to understand with our material logic, material intelligence, we have to try to understand. But you should understand further stages. You should understand that there is another way of simple repeated oral reception. This shabda has got, it's not, this shabda does not only have intellectual energy. It has got the ability to understand. This shabda has got the ability to speak. It has got the ability to understand. There is little energy there.

Something you don't intellectually understand, leave it aside. Go on reading. Leave it for now. One day it will become apparent. It will become clear. Try a little to understand. Beyond that you don't try. Then it becomes speculation. Smoothly it should come. Understanding should come smoothly. No spiritual knowledge can be actually captured. No spiritual knowledge can actually be controlled. No spiritual knowledge will stay with you if you have a sense of ownership. Vidya will run away if you have a sense of ownership. You should have a sense of serving that knowledge. By giving out that knowledge. Hearing repeatedly that knowledge.

What is the meaning of sense of ownership of knowledge? Moment in the idea comes. Okay, now I know this. It's mine. I am a knowledgeable person. I have it. But you know in one second your knowledge can go. It can go into forgetfulness. It is just like Karmis think. I am rich. I got lot of money. In one moment money can go anytime. He can become a pauper. In the same way transcendental knowledge also. You cannot have a sense of possession. You cannot have a sense of possession towards a transcendental knowledge. There should be a sense of reception. All reception. Welcoming and hearing the sound. That comes from a transcendental source. And that sound will expand transcendental knowledge into our heart. Realization into our heart. Transcendental feelings into our heart. And unless transcendental feelings come into our heart. Nothing will get purified. Because all our impurities are in the form of feelings. Wrong feelings. And where are these wrong feelings? These wrong feelings are all stored in our subconscious mind. That is why habits and all don't change. Intellectually you are convinced but your habits don't change. Why? Because they are all stored and packed and tied together with certain feelings in your subconscious. So unless the subconscious gets purified. Subconscious means you are not conscious. It has to get purified.

**Key Quote:** "Submissive hearing means even the feeling of the speaker will go inside."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how submissive hearing allows feelings to penetrate the subconscious, contrasting short-term memory (chemical state) with long-term memory (structural change in the brain) to explain the need for deep, lasting impact.

Means the right feelings have to go inside as we discussed yesterday. Submissive hearing. Submissive hearing means even the feeling of the speaker will go inside. The feeling has to go inside because the contamination is inside. Deep inside. Unless it enters. Simply it remains at an intellectual conviction at your conscious level. That is not enough. You will get temporary benefit. 2-3 days you will be fired up. After hearing something. You hear a japa seminar 2-3 years. 2-3 days your chanting will be very nice. Afterwards it is gone. Why? 2-3 days it is in your short term memory it is there. Scientists have found out that in short term memory means it is only a chemical state. Today you hear something in your neurons. The chemical you know chemical adjustment. Long term memory means that chemical adjustment goes and changes your neurons structure. There is a structural change in your brain. Just other day I was reading this article about neuroplasticity of brain. Brain is such a wonderful thing. Neuroplasticity. Your change can happen by difference in chemical concentrations in the mind. In the brain. Let us say now you learn one sloka. In your short term memory it remains. Immediately in the brain there are certain chemical levels which is corresponding to this learning sloka. And it remains there. But in 2-3 days it will go away. It will go away. It will go away. But in 2-3 days that chemical will go to normal. You have forgotten this sloka.

**Summary:** This segment uses the example of chanting a sloka daily to illustrate how repeated actions create structural changes in the brain, emphasizing the importance of feelings and submissive oral reception for deep, lasting impact.

You cannot repeat that sloka. But if it goes into long term memory. That goes into a structure. Just like we go on saying you know. Say every day we start with Bhagavatam by chanting you know. Nityam Bhagavata Seveya Bhagavati Uttama Slokye Bhaktir Bhavati Naishitiki. Where is this? You are not consciously saying. It has become a structural change in your mind. Let us say first time when you learn that sloka. First 2-3 days. It has not yet become. You will forget it. Now you will not forget it. Because it will just come. Because it has become a structural change in your mind. So anyway. So that is about simple memory thing. So these things have to go deep inside through feelings. Then there has to be a submissive oral reception. That oral reception is so important. That it is such a big thing. That it is such a big factor. The word used is Karna Randrehe. Means through the holes of the ears. The favour of the spiritual master is not received through any part of the body but the ears. Now next Prabhupada is touching upon another very very very very important point. One is about ok. Hearing the transcendental knowledge. The rest of the purport Prabhupada is talking about hearing instructions for your service. Whole purport is about it.

**Summary:** This segment discusses how Srila Prabhupada, despite having thousands of disciples, may have directly instructed only a few, and how the institutional system he set up is a mystical extension of his direct instruction.

The rest of the purport is about it. In earlier days. The Guru used to take only few disciples. Earlier days means just even before the movement. Before Bhaktivinoda Thakur. Even during Bhaktivinoda Thakur also. How many disciples he had? Bhakti Siddhanta Sarva Thakur. How many disciples? May be. Bhakti Siddhanta Sarva Thakur. More disciples in Gaudiya Mathura. First time Bhakti Siddhanta. Otherwise as per this tradition. Spiritual master has accepted some disciples. See so many things Prabhupada is saying here. Ok. The real fact is that spiritual master knows the nature of a particular man. And what sort of duties he can perform in Krishna consciousness. And he instructs him in that way. Now the big question comes. When Prabhupada started this Krishna consciousness movement. He built an institution. Temple presidents. GBC. Temple presidents. And all these things he set it up. Out of thousands and thousands of disciples. Srila Prabhupada would have directly instructed. What sort of duty. Probably you know a dozen or twenty or thirty or fifty disciples. Or even hundred disciples. He would have instructed. Therefore we have to understand that Srila Prabhupada. Instruction is non different from. Prabhupada giving direct instruction is non different. From. The institutional system he set up for receiving instruction.

**Summary:** This segment explains that Prabhupada operates through his servants within the institutional system, and that having faith in this process is crucial for devotees to make advancement.

How can it be same? Mysticism. Mystical. One should understand that Prabhupada is in our midst. Prabhupada was in the midst of all the devotees during his presence. Even though they were receiving instruction from the temple presidents and temple commanders and all. Prabhupada is to operate through them. If you have the faith. And therefore devotees made advancement. Because everybody is a servant of Srila Prabhupada. Temple president is a servant of Prabhupada. Everybody is a servant of Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada acts through one servant to another servant. Is there a difficulty in that? It goes in line with every principle of Vaishnavism. It goes through that process. So if one has faith. Yes it will work. And. We also need to. You know simultaneously understand that that is little different from. Directly Prabhupada saying. It is one and. Different. But the different aspect you have to be very careful. Because if the temple president says something. Go and do this sinful activity. Very obvious no. So principle is not operating there. Is not operating there. Now why don't you drink tea coffee also. No problem. It will not operate there. But if in sincerity. Somebody is executing. His duty. Not only depends upon. The person who is giving instruction. Now we are discussing the problem from the side of the person who is receiving instruction. How will I get. Similar instruction of what according to my ability. What I should do all these things. What should be. What is it that I should receive from Srila Prabhupada.

**Summary:** This segment shifts focus to the receiver of instruction, emphasizing the importance of faith in Prabhupada operating through the system to receive the right guidance.

That is a problem of the receiver. The problem of the receiver is to find. You know how I. To get convinced that you know. My Guru. Srila Prabhupada. Is working through this mechanism. He has that faith. He has to have that faith also. If he does not have faith. He will not get the right instruction from the authority. It's a two way thing. The giver of instruction should represent himself as Srila Prabhupada's servant. The receiver of instruction should have faith. In fact this is more important. The faith of the person that see I. I pray to Srila Prabhupada that I get the right kind of instruction from my. From the system. Here. Mystically operates. And once you take gets the instruction then you think he understands that this is Prabhupada's instruction to me. This is a duty assigned to me. I should execute it meticulously. Seriously. As a servant of the servant of the servant. I should execute it. So unless one understands this mystical process in which this works. If one simply thinks one does not. Consider the. That Prabhupada is operating through the devotees. Who are chanting their 16 rounds. Who are following the instruction that given by Srila Prabhupada. Who are executing their duties. There are some duty. It is a duty of certain people to give instruction to people who are below. It is a duty. So while doing that duty that will be. That will be. When he is chanting 16 rounds. When he is doing whatever Prabhupada has told. That duty will pass down.

That right instructions will come. Now this is something very. Sometimes very bewildering to the mind. How can it be exactly. See he asked me to do now cooking today. How do I know that you know. Just like Prabhupada says. Here he says. This spiritual master knows your particular nature. And what sort of duties he has to perform. And he instructs him that way. No doubt we are Prabhupada disciples. Everything is fact. It is acting on us. We are enjoying or we are part of this process. We are part of this process. Each one of us are part of this process. If you have got a service in the DT room. If you have got a service in the kitchen. It is all Prabhupada. Through Prabhupada only it is coming. Otherwise you will feel that. Somebody told me. Okay I will wait one day when Prabhupada will tell me. That day will never come. That day will never come. Why not take that your whatever duty you get as highly sacred and execute it. It is sacred. Temple president is an instrument. Temple commander is an instrument. Assistant commander is an instrument. Department head is an instrument. There is a mystical process happening here. Mystically these things are happening. One has to accept that. The service that he is doing is sacred. It is coming from my spiritual master. And then sometimes one may think. Oh okay then they gave me this service. Then they thought that is wrong. Maybe you are not good at it. Now we realize you are not good at it. The authority will say. Now we realize you are not good at it. Now we will give you another service. Then your mind will think. They should have thought of it earlier. I am not good at it. How do you explain that?

**Summary:** This segment advises devotees to focus on developing an attitude of servitude and following instructions, rather than over-analyzing the specific service they are assigned.

This is another very important point devotee should understand. In the beginning when we say according to one's capacity all those things. The first thing that devotee should learn for several years in his life. Is not about particular service. It is about servitude. Developing the attitude of servitude. One should not get into this analysis paralysis. That oh okay so today I have been sent to Ashton Pujari for doing this. Okay I do not know really why Prabhupada brought me into. Maybe Prabhupada does not want me to Ashton Pujari. Maybe Prabhupada wants me to cut sabji. This is analysis paralysis. You paralyze your life by analyzing too much. So if you assume that Prabhupada wants every time what exactly you should be doing. That is an illusion. In Prabhupada's mind that is not there. Prabhupada's mind sometimes he may have. But every point every hand he move. Every you know thing you move. Prabhupada wants and that is what you are doing. Prabhupada is saying. Prabhupada is teaching us Krishna consciousness to serve the Supreme Lord. Right. So Prabhupada will say look. You are a neophyte now. This will be in Prabhupada's mind. You are a neophyte. I am not very particular about whether you cut sabji or do Ashton Pujari work. Possible no? So why we should assume that everything. Any service. Now I want you to follow this system. And learn how to be a servant.

You know cleaning the pots. Does not matter. Somebody will do it and service will go on. If you don't cut sabji. Somebody else. Somebody will cut sabji. There is nothing particularly I am going to you know. Some spiritual lesson coming from. Cutting sabji which cannot be got from. Washing the pots. So don't get into this analysis paralysis. When a particular. Suppose some particular service. These are all very very high things. Like Lord Krishna wanted Prabhupada to. Or Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur wanted. Or some specific instruction to Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur. Go to America and preach. We should not imitate that. Neither Krishna nor Prabhupada wants any of those particular things now. When we clean ourselves then one day it will manifest. When we learn how to be humble. When we learn how to be servant. At the right stage. That kind of instruction. Divya Gyan. Hidayat Prakash. Within the heart of the disciple. The spiritual master will guide him. And he will be convinced that I have to do this. He will be convinced I have to do it. Now is a purification stage. We have to purify ourselves. Now I got a dream that I should build a temple in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Nobody can stop me now. You will go and drown in the Indian Ocean. There is a process of purification. There is a process that the Guru is expecting out of you. All upstart thinking you should not get into. Then you will mess up your life. Be patient. Be Shanti.

We should compare for getting inspired. We should not compare for getting despaired. I don't know whether there is a word like that in English. As I said. It is a formula for permanent unhappiness.

Please be what you are in your service. Aspire for devotional qualities. Don't aspire for social rise here, that, this, this thing, that thing. You know, when I will be temple commander, when I will be this, when I will be this. Because you see what happens. The material world is a lording world. So lording has got good value in this material world, conditionally. Somebody who has got control over money, control over position, all these things, it gives value. So we don't get bewildered by all these things because we are left and come. A devotee who thinks he is a temple president is not a temple president. A devotee who thinks I am a temple commander is not a temple commander. A devotee who thinks that I am a servant temple president, he is in the right platform. I am a servant temple commander. I am a servant assistant temple commander. If you enjoy giving instructions, which are very difficult for somebody to follow. If you enjoy giving instruction. If you enjoy criticizing, those who work under you, sometimes you have to criticize.

It is painful for you to criticize. If it is painful for you, do it. If you are enjoying, don't do it. You cannot enjoy criticizing any Vaishnava. But at the same time you have to, sometimes your duty is to criticize and correct. The spirit has to be, the right spirit of service has to be there when you criticize, when you correct.

**Summary:** This segment addresses a question about how devotees outside the institutional system receive guidance, emphasizing the importance of associating with the temple and following the instructions of the authority.

Any questions? Here. Hare Krishna Prabhu. Hare Krishna. Prabhu said like in a system like whatever Prabhu there was one statement like you read in the Parbhad King. Prabhupada engages us, he knows our nature and he engages us what we are good at. So now physically Prabhupada is not there. So when we are under the system, so whatever our authority says through the system we get Prabhupada's instructions. But there are many followers of Prabhupada who are not in the system, who are outside the institution. How do they get guidance of Prabhupada in that? Outside the system also they have to be. That is why see the temple president is the one who recommends somebody for initiation. And the temple president is a spiritual authority for them also. They just go flying around after initiation, they won't advance. They have to associate with the temple. They have to take guidance from the temple. That is very important. Sadhu Sangha factor is not exempted for them. So Sadhu Sangha is happening in ashram, in this thing they are happening continuously in the Vaishnava community it is happening. Just because I am a congregation you know I don't have to listen to temple president. Finish, you are going to Maya, finish. Advancement is gone. I don't have to listen to temple authority, it is gone. Ahankara comes. False ego comes. One thinks he is a big achiever. I achieved this, I achieved this. It will not last for long.

**Summary:** This segment explains that Prabhupada wants both results and a proper attitude, warning that success can feed false ego and lead to a loss of spiritual power if not approached with humility and service.

When you distribute books, when you do anything, what does Prabhupada wants? You should not first think that... Prabhupada wants two things, you should always remember. One is my attitude, another is he wants result. He is happy. It is recorded, you distribute more books, Prabhupada is happy. But if your attitude you are getting more and more of that. More and more ahankara, more and more confident. I am, I am, I am doer, I am doer. And then you are distributing books. Slowly you lose your power. Spiritual power you will lose. You will fall down. Spiritually you will fall down. Your material ability you may be pursuing, but spiritually you will fall down. You will not be able to follow regulated principles. You will become, you are choked. It is just like a weed. The weed is growing. Success is, success is feeding your false ego. Success is not feeding your soul. Simply lip service you do, Prabhupada's, Prabhupada's mercy I distributed so many books. Prabhupada's mercy I distributed so many books. You don't mean what you mean. It is just words you say. But inside you are feeding your, socially you are feeding your ahankara. So those who are not within the temple atmosphere, those who get initiated, they should be connected to the temple. They should understand that, you know, they should follow the instructions of the authority. Then they are safe. Otherwise simply going on, it goes on. They won't find happiness. They won't find that, that spiritual progress. They cannot feel that.

**Key Quote:** "If you are enjoying, don't do it."
**Summary:** This segment addresses a question about how to criticize someone when one knows they will enjoy it, emphasizing the importance of escalating the issue to a higher authority if one cannot criticize without enjoyment, and adjusting one's approach based on the devotee's consciousness.

Yes. Hare Krishna, Prabhu. Prabhu, you told that if you are enjoying criticism of a Vaishnava, if you are authority of him, if you are enjoying, then don't do it. And if you are, the moment you feel pain in criticizing, then you do it. So, suppose if I am authority and if I am, I have to criticize someone, somebody has done mistake. Sure. I know that I will enjoy that criticism. So should I wait for the day to come? Not wait for the day. First you should, first, because you are obligated to do your duty. You have this knowledge that without enjoying, try to criticize. If you cannot, please take it to your higher authority, who may be capable of without enjoying, criticize. You cannot leave. Duty cannot be neglected. The person has to be corrected means he has to be corrected. Somebody has to do the job. So, then you should think this is Prabhupada's test. This is a test that Prabhupada has given me. I should build up my internal thing that I am, while doing this service of telling another Jeeva something, criticizing, I cannot be enjoying that. It is a service to that devotee. So, I have to build up that service mode. I cannot be impulsive. So, duty also has to be done. You need not wait for it. Escalation is there. Go to the next level, next level, next level. That way it is safe. Anybody who is an authority, when they criticize, when there are difficult situations, sometimes the devotee very rebellious becomes. Then, you know, you need to give a lording back. Everything, every time in management, soft thing doesn't work. Right? The person will be completely in Maya. What is the use of showing spiritual humility before him? He will go more into Maya. So, you have to go according to that devotee's consciousness. You have to become very heavy also. So, with great difficulty you should become heavy, not enjoy becoming heavy. I don't know that. This is a very, very, for a Vaishnava, this is a very unpalatable job. To criticize a devotee, to get heavy on a devotee, it's not an enjoyable thing. But it has to be done. And when you do it with that difficulty, with that restriction, with that hesitation, you will see it will have the spiritual power

It is a sound in which the Lord has entered. It becomes a Lord's sound body. Touching this sound is equal to touching the Lord. The Lord is all pure, all knowledge, all bliss, all love.

Some other noises are there, even though it is falling on your ears right now surrounding this for you, you are not hearing that because you are applying your attention is on what I am speaking. Similarly, our attention should be on the hearing, running the attention, just like you run to try Dinge running like that and that this is a good thing to think about you are not, your attention should run along with the chanting, Hari Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna – Hare Hare Hare Hare!

**Summary:** The speaker encourages focusing on hearing the mantra to push out thinking and uses the analogy of iron in a fire to illustrate the importance of continuous association with the sound.

All this should be stopped by simply hearing what you chant. Okay? You don't try to stop thinking, rather you focus on hearing. Hearing will push out the thinking. And if you observe, you can experience yourself, take it as a challenge to yourself, non-stop without any thinking, one hearing over another hearing, one mantra over another mantra, one mantra over another mantra, one mantra over another mantra, without any thinking. Even 108 rounds, 108, one mala you do and see what is the effect of this piling up hearing over hearing over hearing. Because Krishna himself, by touching him, just like you take a piece of iron put in the fire, it becomes red hot slowly. Okay? But you take the iron, put inside the fire for two minutes, take it out again, again put it for two minutes, again take it out, again put it inside, take it out. Even after a hundred years, will the iron become red hot? No. Now our chanting is like this. We hear one mantra, then mind goes thinking, we are out of the fire. Then again, oh, oh, I have to hear, you hear, you again go inside.

So do you want to experience the fire of Satyacitta Ananda? Then you have to consciously task, what is the task? Keep your attention. Keep your attention on the sound as the sound is appearing. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. It's a question of training the mind. And then afterwards, once you do little effort to only hear, then that to lock the mind on hearing, the Shakti comes from the Nama himself, from the Hare Krishna. The Hare Krishna mantra himself, it will lock. It is the mercy of the Lord when, if the Lord, Nama Prabhu allows you to lock. Because you are staying in the fire, you'll get purified. Therefore, it is said, one of the ten offenses is to be inattentive while chanting. Prabhupada says, the sound is Krishna. Be very careful. God is right there before you. Please give attention. Don't neglect. Don't be disrespectful. Giving attention is a first respect. If a guest comes in your house, and you ignore, you don't give attention, you act as if he is not there, isn't it an insult? In the same way, you don't give attention. In the same way you invoke Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare and you are roaming around everywhere else. Your mind is roaming everywhere without hearing. It is an offence. It is an insult. On the other hand, if you are very careful and hearing, the Nama Prabhu becomes very happy and very pleased and He will bestow upon you Sat, Chitta and Ananda Shakti in

**Summary:** The speaker explains that concentration in japa means doing only one thing - hearing - and that attention is a tool that can be controlled to invite the Lord into the heart, bringing the fire of eternity, knowledge, and bliss.

So concentration means a task to ensure that I don't do anything else. Doing only one thing, it is called also concentration. Seeing only one thing. One point on the wall, that is seeing concentration. Japa is doing concentration. You do only one thing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing. Hearing is a doing. That means doing, why hearing is a doing also? Because you have to handle your attention. Your attention is under your control. Not only that. Now you have decided to listen to what I am speaking. That means you have controlled your attention to hear what I am saying. So attention is in your control. Usually we, the mind takes our attention, wherever the mind takes my attention, I am also going, but actually attention is your property. You can decide. You can tell the mind. No, not here, here. Attention is a carrier. Mind is a carrier of attention. Be here now. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Krishna, string over, then Hare Rama string, Hare Krishna over, Hare Rama, one bead over, one bead over, one bead over, one bead over, one bead over. Hearing means fire is going into your heart. The fire of Satya, Chitta and Ananda. The fire of eternity, knowledge and bliss is going into your heart. In the example, we put the iron in the fire. God is so merciful. Our soul is like iron. Krishna is so merciful, so kind that he descends through our ears, into our heart. Fire is coming to you. The fire of Satya and Ananda is coming to you. So if you don't hear, then you are not inviting the Lord into your heart.

Many times I have given a summary talk on soulful japa. So now onwards, on our Ekadashi, I will deal with the cards, the cue cards that we have made. How best to utilize these cue cards? These cue cards are ultimately the content. In these cue cards, the intellectual content, the spiritual content, the emotional content has to enter our subconscious mind by repeated reflection and contemplation. Once it enters our subconscious, then it creates a wonderful, wonderful background to our chanting and hearing in the foreground. The foreground mind will be chanting and hearing and tasking. The background mind will be relating with the Nama Prabhu who is before us. This is the basic premise of Nama Prabhu.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on training the mind for soulful japa, distinguishing between foreground and background mind activities, and introduces the concept of mindful japa with shraddha.

Soulful japa. Soulful japa means whole mind japa. Both foreground mind and background mind. Then there is complete absorption in Nama Prabhu. Our full mind is foreground mind and background mind. So we should train our mind, not only in foreground chanting and hearing, but also train the mind in background mind to have only matters which are glories of the holy name, matters which are feelings about the relationship with the holy name, the bhavanas, the feelings about the holy name. So that part of the training is what is designed through these cards. These are all manifestations from Srila Prabhupada and Nama Prabhu, these cards. It has very deep meaning. Ultimately our mind, there are three stages of perfecting japa: Mindful japa, Spiritful japa, and Soulful japa. Mindful japa is when you give your complete mind to chanting and hearing, and feeling his presence in the background mind, Nama Prabhu's presence. In other words, chanting and hearing and tasking with shraddha is mindful japa.

Then, Spiritful japa. Spiritful japa means not only mind, you chant with joy, excitement, enthusiasm, heartfully, liking to chant. So mindful chanting, mindful japa plus preeti, aglada, hrstam, utsaha, these are all, you know, you have to offer from your spirit. You have to be happy about chanting. You have to be enthusiastic about chanting. You have to joyfully chant, happily chant, enthusiastically repeat. These are all feelings, enthusiasm, joy, happily doing, which means this comes from the spirit. Mindful japa is more like controlling your mind. It's a technique. Don't go here in their mind, only here. That is mindful japa. Spiritful japa means you start giving your spirit. Then soulful japa means chanting in relation to the mind. So, this is the spiritual relationship with the holy name, like sambandha, saranagati, kripapeksha, it is like talking to the Nama Prabhu.

**Summary:** The second secret of soulful japa is introduced: task hearing over previous hearing, explained through the analogy of heating a piece of iron, and the concept of 'Ejna' as an offering to Krishna.

is hear what you chant. Second secret, task hearing over previous hearing. One mantra hearing is over. Before its effect is over, put on the next one. That means you pile up. You should not be in between the mantras, something else. You should not think. Your attention should be piling up one hearing over another hearing. That can happen only if you do that work, tasking. Tasking means it is a work. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama, even in tasking next, put the next one on top. Hear one after the other and hear one after the other, build up. One Hare Krishna chanting you do, that association, let's say it gives you some warmth. It's energy. Before that cools off, next one should be there. Before that next one, before. Suppose you take a piece of iron, put in the fire, becomes heated, you take it out. It will become cool. Again you put it inside, it will become hot. Again you take it out. Put it outside, become cool. But you keep it inside only, what will happen? Heat will build up, build up, build up. That is what meaning, task, hearing over previous hearing. Hearing over previous hearing. This will ensure that no thinking activity will happen. Offer tasking of hearing as a doing, yajna. This is an yajna. It is pleasing to Krishna, this is a offering to Krishna. This is a giving and receiving. So if someone wants to go there, he will be heard. That is all. But you have to get the gift of hearing. Pay attention to this. Yajna. Doesn't mean, someone has to take your hand, but do you have to be careful about this? Yajna.

Yajna. Your chanting, your foreground mind, your background mind should be indulging in heart talk. Heart talk about the glories of the holy name or heart talk about my relationship with Nama Prabhu. Heart talk is another word for Bhavana. Bhavana does not mean feeling alone. Bhavana is a thought feeling. Behind the feeling there is a thought. A thought you are convinced about. A belief is there, and then the feeling is there. Shraddha is a Bhavana, is a heart talk. Just like you say, okay, you offer Shraddha to Nama Prabhu. Then you explain, what is more? What is this? How do I offer Shraddha? Shraddha is a heart talk. Heart talk is feelingly the narrative that Krishna is present before me. Read the first line. Offer in the background mind my emotionalized TRP narratives called Bhavana. What is TRP? Truth, relationship and purpose. We will explain what? Bhavana or heart talks. Truth narrative is during japa. Truth narrative is called Shraddha. Shraddha that Krishna himself has incarnated before me on each bead as his persona of Shakti Avesha Nama. See Nama Prabhu. This is a simple matter of fact. Faith. Matter of truth. Absolute truth.

**Key Quote:** "So spiritual life is all about Shraddha. It is about talk."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to define Shraddha as fundamental, emphasizing the soul's ability to talk and align with narratives, and introduces Preeti as the relationship narrative.

As soon as I am chanting Krishna who is within and without of everything has come before me as the hearable, chantable sound, is manifest, is pratyeksha, immediately. So that truth, that feeling is called Shraddha. Shraddha is fundamental. Any other Bhavana is not there also. Shraddha is fundamental. That is why I said even in mindful chanting Shraddha is a must. Without Shraddha mindful chanting is like a mechanical chant. Mechanically you may hear every word that you are chanting because of the mind control. You control the mind that each sound is captured. But Shraddha, why each sound you should take inside because he is Krishna himself has come before me. That is Shraddha. So that is a heart talk. Shraddha is a heart talk. See the soul in this material world in this body, trapped in this material world, trapped as in Indra. One of the faculties that the soul, even now most powerful faculty of the soul is its ability to talk. Remember that. Not ability to think, not ability to see, it is ability to talk. So spiritual life is all about Shraddha. It is about talk. Your mind immediately aligns with the talk, narrative. That is why I call this as narrative. Bhavana is nothing but emotionalized and intellectualized narrative, narrative of something you are convinced about. So that is Shraddha. So there is a narrative of truth. There is a narrative of relationship. What is my relationship with Nama? That narrative is Preeti, of respectful intimacy towards him. That is a relationship. That is also a originate. It originates in a sound of the soul, in talk of the soul.

Krishna loves all living entities. Therefore it is natural for me to love him, to offer love to him. Preeti. I have Preeti towards Nama Prabhu. I have Preeti towards Krishna, who is so kind and mercifully coming before me as his Shabda persona, as his Nama persona. So little intellectualizing is required. Why I should have Preeti? That is intellectualization. So in order to put any bhavana into your heart, you have to be convinced. A strong belief. A strong belief of truth has to be there. A strong belief of my relationship with Nama Prabhu. So truth narrative of Nama Prabhu, relationship narrative of Nama Prabhu, and then there is purpose.

Even I am trying to follow. My japa has not become any super, but I know if you follow this, it becomes super.

You don't have to indulge your thinking capacity to load those Bhavana because so many Bhavana's are there. Vinamrta, Rishtam. On each bead there should be a Bhavana because on each bead Krishna is appearing. Receiving him with, receive him with Bhavana. Serve him with Bhavana.

**Key Quote:** "So, improving the japa means moving from mindless japa to mindful japa, then to spiritful japa, then to soulful japa."
**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa explains the progression of japa from mindless to soulful, emphasizing the importance of engaging the mind and consciousness.

So, improving the japa means moving from mindless japa to mindful japa, then to spiritful japa, then to soulful japa. It is a question of practice. If we do not consciously take care, because of the nature of the mind, our japa will be mindless japa. Mindless japa is just tongue japa. Only tongue you are giving to Krishna. Not giving your consciousness, not giving your mind, not giving your ears. So, mindless japa is very... It is offensive japa. You are doing japa, but you are neglecting to hear. You are neglecting to give your mind to the nama of the Lord. You are neglecting to give your mind to the avatara who is before us and all these different stages of good quality chanting, good quality japa has to be practiced in a systematic way.

For several months, probably I would say at least two months, you completely focus on mindful japa by reading the cards 1.1 to 1.6, 2.1 to 2.6, 3.1 to 3.6. By understanding what is in the card, which gives us, which will load into your consciousness, into your background mind, into your memory, what is, why you are doing japa, what is proper japa, who is the holy name, who is the chanter, what should be your consciousness.

So you don't have to, you can take one at a time. One card you take for three days, like that, whatever way you want to devise, by repetition, it has to go into the subconscious. Card number two is Shraddha. In Shraddha, who is his holy name? How he incarnates? What is his name? How does he incarnate? How does he incarnate? Why he incarnates? Card number one is basic introduction of how japa is doing of three kinds of doings, doing of chanting, doing of hearing. In other words, doing of knowing the sound, doing of tasking uninterruptedly, uninterruptedly repeating the chanting and hearing, understanding the context of japa, seva, sevak, sevya, capsulized chanting. All these words are important. If you learn immediately, the concept will come into your memory. Capsulized japa means mantra by mantra, bead by bead japa. You should be aware of the sevya continuously when you are doing the japa seva. Remember the sevya is

Chanting is your… you need your subtle to gross speaking. Feeling potency of my body, my soul is to be offered in chanting, in uttering the Nama and hearing the Nama. So therefore chanting is a doing, hearing is knowing, being attentive to the Nama, knowing that is also another doing, Hare Krishna, one after other, bead after bead. So what is left? Feeling is left. So, feeling is independent of your doing. You can feel, you can do and feel, yes or no. You can hit a person, but you can also angrily hit a person, which will be more effective. Angrily hitting. Hitting with Bhavana. Doing with Bhavana. So your chanting and hearing is a doing. Do with Bhavana.

requires explanation. That will be there, one page explanation. The process I am telling. I have nothing to do with naham, nirmama, nothing to do with preyas, rasas or false dual egos, kama bija, kama bhavana, kama apeksha, kama sankalpa, kama karya, kama vasana, kama drishti. So a little advanced, but it's all philosophy of Krishna consciousness from Prabhupada's books. 14.6, you see now. This is what I have said. It is called SMDA technique. Shravanam, that is first reading. Then you don't understand. Then you do mananam. You understand what is written. And when you understand everything, this is all about bhavanas. The bhavana that comes out of that understanding, will manifest. That you have to repeat. That is called dhyana. That you have to repeat. 14.7 So that thought becomes thought plus feeling. When you do mananam it becomes a thought. The idea is there. Mananam becomes a thought feeling when you repeat the idea several times. Just like why you are grateful. That one of the cards you take. That idea, oh, I'm grateful because of this, because of the mananam. When you're convinced, when it becomes a conviction, it starts becoming a feeling. Every feeling requires a reasoning. You always have, if you have to get angry, there has to be a reasoning behind that. Is it not? So that reasoning, so before it becomes a bhavana, you have to have reasons. That is mananam. Understand the philosophy, that particular point, mananam. Then dhyanam is, that feelings are repeated. And then already feelings are there, reasoning. Reasoning is there, feeling is there, anusilana. Anusilana means in the japa you practice. As I said, take one card and today I will do this one card, today's japa. First you read all these dusravanam and all these anusilana. Last 96 days of your training, last three months, take one card because you already read several times, one card. And do it. Hold 16 rounds, you take that one card. Next day you take that, like that. Then this practice has no end. Second year again you can start. Third year again you can start. And in three, four years, you're complete, your consciousness, you're doing japa, you're completely in relationship with the Holy Name. No more mindless chanting. No more mechanical chanting. You will enjoy being with Krishna for the, for the whole

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by expressing gratitude and explaining that Nama is Chintamani, a touchstone that fulfills desires, emphasizing the importance of maintaining spiritual desires and communicating with Nama Prabhu through the language of feeling.

Hare Krishna Nama Prabhu Ki. Let us thank Nama Prabhu for protecting our devotional service, protecting our service to Srila Prabhupada, protecting our service to the wonderful, most merciful deities of the Hare Krishna hill. Shishi Radha Krishna Chandra Ki Jai. Shishi Krishna Balaram Ki Jai. Shishi Radha Krishna Chandra Ki Jai. Shri Buddha Shri Krishna Madhyagana Ki Jai. Shri Lifesa подобya Ki Jai. Shri Nama Prabhu Ki Jai. Hare Krishna Nama Prabhu is also, whole Nama is also called Chintamani Nama, Nama Chintamani. Chintamani means touchstone. Touchstone means anything you touch with your desire. Yes, become gold, it will become gold. It is a touchstone, Chintamani. Nama is Chintamani. When you desire, you speak to the Nama, it becomes fulfilled. But we should be careful as devotees, we should maintain our relationship to only seek spiritual desires. Is it not? Because somebody is very powerful and you go and ask him, give me this that he is not happy with, you will spoil your relationship. Right? The fact is that this is Nama. He can give anything. Nama can give you anything. So devotees are in difficulty. They have nowhere to go. They always go to Nama Prabhu. They talk to Nama Prabhu during japa. I told you talking is not by language or not by words. What is the language of talking to Nama Prabhu? Feeling. If somebody stands, if somebody comes before you and if he is in danger, looking at his face, you can make out. That is language of? Feeling. So with Nama Prabhu, all these are language of feeling. Gratitude, surrender, Vinamrita, Krita Jnana, Kripa Apeksha, Seva Apeksha. Nama Prabhu catches your feeling during japa. Catches your feeling.

**Key Quote:** "Hearing from an authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the core principle that hearing from a spiritual authority provides a superior experience compared to relying solely on personal understanding.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, 10-3, Chapter 22, Entitled The Marriage of Kardamamuni and Devahuti, Verse No. 10: YADATU BHAVATASILA SHRUTA RUPA VAYO DUNAN ASHRANON NARADHA DESHA TVAYAYA SITRITANISHAYA. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "The moment she heard from the sage Narada of your noble character, learning, beautiful appearance, youth and other virtues, she fixed her mind upon you." Purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "The girl Devahuti did not personally see Kardamamuni, nor did she personally experience his character or qualities, since there was no social intercourse by which she could gain such understanding. But she heard about Tridamamuni from the authority of Narada Muni. Hearing from an authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding. She heard from Narada Muni that Tridamamuni was just fit to be her husband, therefore she became fixed in her heart that she would marry him, and she expressed her desire to her father who therefore brought her before him." Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Parvat. Devahuti, the daughter of Swayambhuva Manu, came to fix her mind upon desiring Kardamamuni, is being explained by Manu, and it is specifically explained in the purport by Prabhupada that she knew about Kardamamuni only by hearing from Narada Muni. And by hearing from Narada Muni about Kardamamuni, she got a better experience than even gaining personal understanding. So this principle, hearing from an authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding, is a very heavy principle being made here. Thank you. Generally, this does not appeal to common sense. One will think that first I should hear and then I should experience. In spiritual life also we have a tendency, because that is how our mind works. Now I am reading these things, one day I will directly experience. But that is completely being, that process is completely being countered by the statement of Prabhupada. Hearing from an authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding. We have to believe it. It does not appeal to common sense. It is a very heavy principle.

### hearing Krishna, seeing Krishna, spiritual sound, spiritual world

**Key Quote:** "Because if you happen to see Krishna, if you are not pure, you are not able to understand Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the principle by comparing hearing about Krishna from a pure source to seeing Krishna directly, emphasizing the importance of purity and the nature of spiritual sound.

It does not appeal to common sense. This is relative. Which is better? Just like which is better, hearing about Krishna or seeing Krishna? According to this, if you hear from an authority about Krishna, it is better than seeing Krishna. Because if you happen to see Krishna, if you are not pure, you are not able to understand Krishna. If you are pure then you will think, "Oh, maybe somebody from some drama party has come before me," even if he is genuine Krishna. Now, hearing Krishna purely, there are different ways of hearing about Krishna. The source should be pure. Now let's go into this hearing experience. Number one, source should be pure here because Narada spoke. The hearer should be submissive, because only when you are submissive then the perception will go into your subconscious. At the conscious level, your hearing is always being analyzed and judged. Real hearing is not analyzing and judging. Submissive hearing means allowing that sound to enter you and that sound will expand, that perception expand the meaning of the shabda. One should have faith that this shabda is transcendental. Of course, Prabhupada is talking about transcendental hearing, which is, you know, in our normal world, what is it? It's the other way around. You hear something and then you hear about America and go and see America. That is correct in the relative world, it is correct. But in the spiritual world it's not like that, not spiritual hearing, nor during our sadhana stage, it is not like that. Anything to do with spiritual shabda is not that. One has to have faith that the spiritual shabda is impregnated with the meaning of that shabda, what multi-dimensional meaning that are all contained in it. If I use a word, if I say pen, in that word pen, in the material world, pen is not there. In the spiritual shabda, say Hare or Krishna or Rama, in that shabda, Hare is there, Krishna is there, Rama is there. There is no difference between shabda and the personality of that shabda, because everything is personality. Prabhupada gives example in the spiritual world also. Water, water, you say. You have water. Whether your thirst should be quenched or not, that water should mercifully decide. Here you put water on the tongue, there is no question of not getting quenched, because the water here is just matter. It has to. But in the spiritual world, water is a person.

**Key Quote:** "So spiritual hearing means you have to remove the shutter of rational mind."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the power of the Hare Krishna mantra and the importance of submissive hearing, which involves removing the filters of the rational mind to allow for spiritual transformation.

So you say water, water, water. That is why it is said, Atta, Ashi, Krishna, Nama, Naba, Naba, Ved, Gra. Mahim, Indriya. Anything in the spiritual world you cannot capture. Everything is a person. There has to be a relationship. You say water, water, water. Water is not different from water. But that water decides, "Personality, or I should keep this person thirsty?" You decide to keep thirsty. To quench the thirst or not to quench the thirst is the decision of the personality of water. But it is not different. So in the same way, the holy name, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. If the shabda is there, then automatically we should automatically become pure in a moment, because it is Krishna himself I am touching. No, he is a person. You deserve, you qualify. Are you begging? What is your mood? Have you fed up with material world? Are you ready to experience me? No, all those things. Yes. Now I will purify you. Cheto-darpanam. Cheto-darpanam marjanam. That too, if you are hearing, is a relationship. Oh, and where is the question of, you know, even Cheto-darpanam marjanam, this fellow is completely offensive, this jiva. He is utilizing my name for so many things. He thinks I can, you know, I can be used for everything. For his power, knowledge, fame, everything, he can use Harinam. So will Harinam respond? Will not respond. Harinam will not. He will respond. He will respond. He will respond appropriately. But the fact is that the Lord is there. Nama Incarnation is there. The Nama Incarnation, the specific character is there. He is very, very merciful. The most merciful incarnation is Nama Incarnation, which is brought down by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And this Hare Krishna Maha Mantra is non-different from Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Radha Krishna Anya. This mantra is nothing but the personalities of Radha and Krishna. So spiritual hearing means you have to remove the shutter of rational mind. Submissively one should hear. Submissively and faithfully one should hear. It's a big, it's a very big transformative power, transformative process that we are all possessing.

### Prabhupada's books, subconscious, rational mind, realization

**Key Quote:** "Realization is when it goes into your subconscious."
**Summary:** This segment explores how to effectively read Prabhupada's books to allow the knowledge to penetrate the subconscious mind, leading to genuine realization and transformation.

How to read Prabhupada's books? How to read Prabhupada's books so that it enters your subconscious? Conscious mind, we are constantly filtering it. How does something go into the subconscious when you are very emotional? Isn't it? That is how people get trauma and all, isn't it? The situation is charged with emotions, your subconscious opens. That is how you say, "By this experience I learnt." It opens. Otherwise rational mind will not, your lesson will just remain there, and in few days it will go away. Whatever you learn with your rational mind, so much logic you will tell and this is that, this is that, it will remain for two, three days and it will go away. Those things are not called realizations. Realization is when it goes into your subconscious, and there it brings about permanent change in your perception, permanent change in your attitude towards life. So how to make this shabda of Prabhupada enter into our subconscious? As I said, one of the things is to stop this, remove the shutter of rational filter that we have, where we analyze and judge everything. No doubt when you first came to Srila Prabhupada's books, you are trying to read everything, you understand, you are questioning how Krishna is God or this or that, everything. I mean you are reading everything. How Krishna is God, why Krishna is God, all these things, your rational mind. But actually that answer to your rational mind is not what made you devotee, by the way. Because how Krishna is God, why Krishna is God, you will never find the proof in the Bhagavad Gita. It is not a book of proof. It is a book of declaration.

**Key Quote:** "It is a book of declaration."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the Bhagavad Gita is not a book of logical proof but a declaration of truth, and that faith is awakened through hearing from a spiritual authority.

Krishna is going on saying, "I am God, I am God." And he is saying so many authorities have told, "I am God." There is no evidence there given. Universal form, yeah, you can say that, universal form. Universal form also, you know, so many people can show also. I heard some magicians and all can show universal form. Logical, rational evidence. So you think, "Oh, I rationally understood." No. By reading, by submissively, repeatedly hearing, Prabhupada's mercy, Krishna's mercy entered your heart, your subconscious. You got that? Yes. So much so that, that becomes an evidence for you. What is that? Krishna's own statement has become evidence. You don't ask any further questions. Yes. That's how it has become. Now when we read Bhagavad Gita, what is the evidence you see? "Oh, Krishna is saying he is God. I am very happy. Oh, Krishna is saying. Krishna. Krishna is saying. Krishna is saying." This is all our evidence now. But when we were karmicists, it don't become evidence. Anybody can declare he is God. No? You use your rational mind. You don't resolve it. But what made you devotee, what made every one of us devotees, is the power of the shabdha of Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada and the Krishna's statement that entered our heart. It has entered our heart. It has got the potency to awaken our original faith. Faith is not created. To create a faith now you need rationality. Suppose that faith is part and parcel of your existence. Who is my father? If that faith is part and parcel, it is a constitutional fact for the jiva. It is a question of not logical proof, it is a question of awakening. That awakening has come by hearing Srila Prabhupada's books.

### Bhagavad Gita, reading process, faith, descending analysis

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Build first of all faith."
**Summary:** This segment shares a personal story about reading the Bhagavad Gita and emphasizes the importance of building faith before engaging in analytical study.

And how is that then? Is there a method by which we can actually make this enter? In my own story, very easily I can say. When I got Bhagavad Gita As It Is, first time, I did not know why I followed that process. I followed that process. Something was so nice. I went on reading very fast. Did not say to analyze and all. That means whatever was going inside, was going inside. Whatever I did not understand, I didn't try to. Like this for long time, Gita, going on, reading, reading. Because it was very tasty because Krishna is, Prabhupada is repeatedly saying. So what Prabhupada is saying? Largely I was concentrating on the purports of Prabhupada, not even connecting the verses of Krishna's. I was just going on reading the Bhagavad Gita, purport, purport, purport, purport, purport, purport. Going on reading the purports. Sometimes the verse also I would skip. Going on reading the purports. So something entered me, because there you are not trying to analyze at that stage. I am not saying you should not analyze, you should not study. That is another process. That is, we have to have control over our faith. We have to have so much faith. Build first of all faith, and have a paradigm of descending analysis. What is descending analysis? This is 100% correct. Not speculative analysis. Descending process analysis. This what is told is correct. I want to understand how it is correct. I know it is correct. Conclusion I have adopted. But I would like to relish how it is correct. Additional bonus. It is correct. So that way, this is the way in which the Shastras are also studied with rational mind, because it has got, everything has got rationality behind it. But rationality in the beginning does not make this enter you, enter your system. Faith. Faithful hearing is required. Submissive hearing is required.

**Key Quote:** "Your paradigm shifts."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how submissive hearing can lead to a shift in paradigms, which are the perspectives stored in our subconscious mind, and introduces the concept of OPSA (Objects, People, Situations, Actions) as the content of our minds.

So if some transformation has to happen, this is submissive hearing. Sometimes you hear, you are very submissively sitting in the class, you hear something. It goes and penetrates your subconscious. Your paradigm shifts, because all these paradigms are nothing but perspectives which we have stored in our subconscious. How we see things. How we see people. How we see situations. Right? Our mind is full of three things. Three or four things you can see. If you take in mind, it contains in that box, there are four things: perception of things. Here you see a camera. You see a kartal. You see this thing. Things, things. Room. Building. You have mapped those buildings into it. That is perception of things. Then there is perception of people. What do I think of this person? This person? This person? This person? Right? This person is a man. This person is a woman. You see. Or this person is a nice person. This person is a bad person. He is friend. He is enemy. So perception of people. Then there is perception of situation. Is it not? Continuously full of these things. Say today you are going out preaching. It is a preaching situation. It is a compound. You get at a glance. Just like I say guru issue. Moment I say guru issue, it is a situation. So many things you will derive out of it. What is guru issue? I tell you. Give me. What is this guru issue? If I ask you to come here, you will stand and you will describe what it is. Actually you are describing what you have, your perception. Is it not? So perception of things, people, situation, and actions. You also perceive actions. Sinful activity. Not sinful activity. Is it not? Actions. Good act. Bad act. Actions. Here there is a fight. There is a situation. And in the situation there is an action of a fight. So there is an action. So object, people, situations, and actions. O. P. S. A. Our head consists of only O. P. S. A.

**Key Quote:** "The primary feeling that we all paste is priti and apriti."
**Summary:** This segment explains how our perceptions are pasted with feelings of like and dislike (priti and apriti), and how our free will influences these attachments and aversions, leading to iccha (desire) and dvesha (aversion).

Now these perceptions, these perceptions are also pasted with feelings. Is it not? Take an object. I like this object. I don't like this object. The primary feeling that we all paste is priti and apriti. Like. Dislike. I like this camera. I don't like this camera. Or I like this camera. I don't like. I don't like something. There are so many dislikes. Objects. Persons. Again there you see. We paste. I like this person. I don't like this person. Then situations. You like and don't like. Yes or no? Prasadam all. Prasadam. You like that situation. If you are called by authority to be chastised, you don't like that situation. Oh. Why he is calling me? Immediately it is pasted. Automatically pasted. I don't like. Like and dislike on situation. Similarly on actions. Activity. You have a perception towards activity. Somebody is angry. You don't like. Somebody kindly treats you. You like. These are all we have put likes and dislikes and connected. Our head is full of all these things. When our free will is connected, when we use our free will, and put priti on something, like, that is called iccha. When we use our free will, and paste dislike on something, it is called dvesha. So Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, iccha dvesha is a karana for our life. That means we have got OPSA. In OPSA you have pasted like and dislike, priti and apriti, resulting in external manifestation of iccha and dvesha.

**Key Quote:** "Like means like."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how likes and dislikes are stored in the subconscious mind, leading to attachments, and how submissive hearing can transform these attachments.

Where you have pasted priti, you like. So how much we have got. Where are these likes and dislikes pasted? It is not in the conscious mind. This is called attachment. Anything that we have pasted, like, we are attached to. No rational reason. No reasoning is required. Like means like. Now you are, you like something as a karmi. Now you are hearing from Prabhupada's book, Gita. This is not to be liked by a devotee. But when that comes up, situation comes up, you will see that you are not able to control. You like it. Shastra says you should not like it. From your heart it comes, "I like it." That is why it is in the subconscious. So like and dislike. If you want to change in your life, submissive shabda should go inside, and it is a bomb. It will change. It will change. Everything will change. So, very powerful Pravasar. Nityam Bhagavata Sevaya. We think you are sitting here for Philosophy. Philosophy. You have understood. In 6 months you have understood the entire Philosophy. If you are sitting here for Philosophy, every time, Bhagavatam class, if you are sitting for Philosophy, you should sit here for paradigm shift.

**Key Quote:** "You should sit here for paradigm shift"
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that attending Bhagavatam class should be for paradigm shift through submissive hearing, and that even the speaker can experience transformation while representing Prabhupada.

If you sit here for philosophy, nothing philosophy all, you will see that nothing is exciting, nothing new you get, because only when you get new it's interesting. That is why some devotees, why class so important? But if they are submissive hearing they are sitting, why are you sitting in the class Bhagavatam, Nityam Bhagavatam? A transcendental process works there. The speaker may not be very great, but if he represents Prabhupada, the speaker who speaks also will get transforming paradigms while speaking. The people who listen also will get paradigm which is shifting. How many people who are given class after class, they thought they got some realization? Everybody will say yes. If you start giving class you will see, because if you have to speak something you have to open your, your shutters, you have to open, you have to speak. If you have to at least speak genuinely, if you have to tell somebody, "See, we are not the body," you are telling five times. When you tell you say, "Look, I am simply telling, no, what is this? I am not this body." You will start wondering how can I realize this. So here it is, this statement is of Prabhupada is wonderful that one should, that experience in spiritual life is through hearing.

**Key Quote:** "Please develop great faith in hearing."
**Summary:** This segment encourages developing faith in hearing and reading, especially the Hare Krishna mantra, and emphasizes the importance of having the proper situational perception and context when chanting the holy name.

Please develop great faith in hearing, reading, hearing the shabda. Reading Prabhupada's purport is like detailed, so many things are that detailed. But Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, only same words again and again and again we are hearing. But Hare Krishna Maha Mantra actually that Hare Krishna Maha Mantra is working, it will submissively if you hear. That is why Shraddha is required, with faith you should hear. Faith in what? The Lord is there, Lord's association it is, and Lord is there. In what mood is he there? That means you should have proper perception of situation of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra in your mind. What is the situation? As soon as Nama manifests on my tongue, what is the situational perception I should have? The Lord, Lord, not simply ontologically, "Lord is there, Lord is there." You should understand this feeling, what is the feeling, what is the single feeling that you can think of the holy name who is before you? Compassion towards me, love and compassion towards me, due to whom? Due to Prabhupada, due to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, like that. Immediately these are all situational thoughts. With that situational thoughts one should serve the holy name. Holy name can be served not by seeing but by hearing and chanting attentively. So it is a relationship that you cannot have a relationship unless you have a situation in the background. The context is very important everywhere. The context is so important. It is the context that brings meaning.

**Key Quote:** "It is the context that brings meaning to everything."
**Summary:** This segment explains that context is more important than the sense objects themselves, and that the context in which we perceive something determines its meaning and impact on us.

To everything. It is not simply perceiving something. For instance, I perceive this camera. This camera, okay, it is an object. But there are so many context to it. This belongs to the temple. It is been set up now for this class. So when I see this camera, I just don't see one camera, I just see it in a context. It is meant for recording classes, all these things. So context is extremely important. It is not the, it is not in fact it is not the, let us go to the sense objects. Sense objects we may see that sense objects are very, what is it? Sense objects are the cause for all my disturbance of my senses. Yeah, it is a cause, only one of the causes. The circumstances, the context in which you see the sense object is what causes real agitation to the senses, not the sense object. Sense object is only a trigger and there are certain circumstances, context in your mind. That is why it is said, that is why the shastra says, shastra says about the context, the context of, "Do not sit alone with one's mother and sister." What is it? It is a context. No? Context are powerful. Context are more powerful than the actual sense objects. Remember this. So context, managing context is, you can manage your, managing the sense object you cannot manage. You have to manage the context.

**Key Quote:** "Managing context is you can manage your managing the sense object."
**Summary:** This segment continues to emphasize the importance of managing the context in our minds, as it is more effective than trying to directly control the senses, and highlights the role of proper association in creating pure contexts.

And where is the context? In the head. The context is in the head. You have to have purified context, pure context, not concocted context. From childhood we have been given certain context. We have to put them into our subconscious. As soon as we see a opposite sex, let's say, it just goes and sits there into our context. There is a net cognitive net inside us. It goes and sits there. The context is what gives the power and the mind cannot control that at that time. Rational mind cannot control. Intuition, feelings, these are the things that come in control. So that is the reason why the most important factor for controlling the senses is not direct control of the senses, but association, proper association. You should, proper association means proper context are there in the mind. How you see opposite sex, proper context are there in the mind, pure context are there. Where do you get from? You get from by hearing how one should see, what it is, everything is there. So when that goes into our subconscious, then naturally, spontaneously you will see in that context, you will not get agitated. If there is a context in which you get agitated, you see a person in a context, in certain other context you will get agitated, does not matter what it is. So should not think that sense of the mind is a cause for all this agitation. Sense object is a trigger. The same sense object can trigger a good concept also. Just like the shastra says, "One should see every other woman as a mother." Now it is a context. If you build that context, you will have no problem at all. Same sense object, no problem at all. So is the problem sense object or context? Context.

**Key Quote:** "You should fear the context in your mind."
**Summary:** This segment advises to fear the context in our minds rather than the sense objects themselves, and reiterates that submissive hearing is the key to changing these contexts.

Understand this. And usually what we do, tendency to think is it is a sense object and then you fear sense object. The more you fear sense object, the more it will obsess you. You should fear the context in your mind. You should fear, you should think of mind is also outside, you know, just like the sense object is outside. Next the context is also there is in you or what? No, it is a filter in the mind. So you fear the sense object, but you don't fear your context. It doesn't help. Whereas you don't fear the sense object, you have the right context, you don't have to fear anything outside. Why do you have to fear anything? Because everything is matter. But if you don't do that, if you don't get that, that is why it is said clear that these are all the principles by which this context are set inside under the guidance of the transcendental words of Bhaktivedanta Karpa spiritual master. Any questions? Hare Krishna. You mean to say context means my response to the situation is that context for example? No, context means that is why I defined first that in our mind there are so many things out of that one item is called situation, perception of situation. Perception of situation when you encounter opposite sex, what is your default situational perception? According to that responses will come. Responses are not the fundamental things. Behind the responses is the context. You have to grip the context. Context comes by submissively hearing.

**Key Quote:** "Subconscious holds the context."
**Summary:** This segment clarifies that the subconscious holds the context, which is a complex cognitive network with emotions and connections, and uses the analogy of a crown and a diamond to illustrate how context affects perception.

Context changes. Yes, changes today. So many context about this world, how you see the world situation, how you see karmis, everything. What is everything? Paradigm shift of situations. The way the karmis see the world, you don't see anymore, because you are seeing the situation differently. They are seeing the situation differently. How did that happen? Because the shabda went inside. So basically context in subconscious mind? No, no, no. Subconscious holds the context. Okay. Context is a cognitive network with emotions, connections, various things, elements are there. It is like a compound. It is not one item. Take this microphone. Neither the properties of hydrogen are oxygen, both are gases. No, the compound has another property. Is it not? It is a compound. Okay. Now in the same way the situation, the entire situation perception creates where the sense of the go and fall in that situation context. In another way you can say a crown is a context. A diamond set in that crown, does it look different? It looks different. No, it is a different. So in the same way a sense object you take and put in different context, the different contextual networks are there in our system. How does the, how that is it's a very complicated thing. You cannot rationally

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the need for rules and regulations, sense control, and tapasya (austerity) to manage the old paradigms and prevent them from influencing our actions, especially in relation to the opposite sex.

go and pick it up and put it there. Yeah, no sense object is always fitting on the primary context. We should take care by submissive hearing. While second really, if you have right context then automatically the right relationship with that sense object will come. Where is the fear? Ideally in between there are rules and regulation till the paradigm shifts. That's what I'm still, the paradigm, this, there are rules and regulations. Be very careful. This paradigm doesn't go so easily for a primary and second. It doesn't go so easily. This old paradigm of yours doesn't go so easily. So be very careful when you relate with the opposite sex. Rules and regulations are required. Sense control is required. Restraint is required. Tapasya is required, because the old paradigm will come and push. When it push you have to hold it. That's called tapas. You have to control, sense control, mind control, sama dhama, gross sense control, not allow, use your willpower to stop the old paradigm from leading it to action. Now dhama's lead you are, you please use your, you use your free will to directly to not to get influenced by the old paradigm at the mind level. These two things can be done only if we have the power to tolerate pain, which is called tapas. So these are all the Brahman has quality without tapas, Shakti without, without, without tolerating, without somebody, you know, I cannot take any pain, my mind, anything and distasteful I cannot take. That means there's got no tapasya theater. Every moment everything should be pleasing. Every moment everything should be very nice, because I have come to spiritual life, it's ananda susukkam kartam. They say tapasya is required. This is the principle of success in spiritual life to put pre T, to paste pre T on tapas. It is your free will, not Dresha on tapas. You should put each on tapas. I want to take this off to it. This will make me progress.

Adding to the purport which you explained that Devahuti heard from Narada Muni more than personally experiencing the same thing, Prabhupada also mentioned when Krishna was there, so many people saw him, but only the four, five Pandavas saw he has a supreme personality. According it, it's all cognitive net show your context wrong. Nothing you just see everything. You have a context wrong. You will see the DTS told you, you are the right context, you will see is not different from the Lord. They're adding to one more point bro, in our community also, you know, when senior devotees authority says that point in time it may not fit into our head because we cannot experience it. The faith is of missive hearing ultimately saves us then this rational thinking analyzing one point in time we have to give it up otherwise yes practically it is impossible to go to next level. Another danger in this is abuse of this hearing processes or which create danger is suppose you are friendly with somebody in the ashram, moment you are friendly what happens? Your rational shutters are lifted, judgment and all is lifted. You associate, they come and put a kid inside you, it goes inside your subconscious. Should very careful whom you are associating. Don't underestimate the process of, "No, I am very rational." Rational you may analyze the logical relationship, but the emotion is unfiltered entering you. After the person say something bad about another person, another devotee, you hear logically you have understood what this fellow told is a bluff behind the back he talked, but factually speaking your emotion somewhere you have, it has conquered you. It has put a bug in you about that person. You should be biggest choice of biggest use of jivas really is in choosing association, choosing association of one person according to context different situation, not that you have to shun anybody. Everybody's associate with the person starts gossiping you should run away. What did I not come here for gossip? I have my own problems. We all have our own problems or not? Every body's share my words or no problems. Whenever somebody asks you how are you or listen you mind you should say, "I'm not fine, my senses are harassing you. I'm not fine. I'm not fine." You all have our own problems till we die. Why you should take others problems? Jai for the Lord and the whole world. Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Yagat Gurshila pravupāda ki Jai.

## How the Principle of Gurutva Functions Universally | Sri Madhu Pandit Dasa | SB 3.22.8 | 06.08.2024

**Key Quote:** "Swayambhuva Manu was concerned about getting his daughter married and obviously he had in his mind Karadvama Muni."
**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa begins by reciting and translating a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Swayambhuva Manu's humble approach to Karadvama Muni, highlighting the importance of respect and grace in the guru-disciple relationship.

om namo bhagavate vasudevaya om namo bhagavate vasudevaya Madbhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 22, Text 8 sabhavandh trasneha pariklishthatmano mama srotam arhasi dhinasya shravitam kripaya mune Translation in purport by S. D. V. Bhai Charanarvinda Bhaktivedanta Swamishila Prabhupada Translation O great sage, graciously be pleased to listen to the prayer of my humble self, for my mind is troubled by affection from my daughter. Purport by Srila Prabhupada: When a disciple is perfectly in consonance with the spiritual master, having received his message and executed it perfectly and sincerely, he has a right to ask a particular favour from the spiritual master. Generally, a pure devotee of the Lord or a pure disciple of a bona fide spiritual master does not ask any favour either from the Lord or the spiritual master. But even if there is a need to ask a favour from the spiritual master, one cannot ask that favour without satisfying him fully. Swayambhuva Manu wanted to disclose his mind regarding the function he wanted to execute due to affection for his daughter. Thus ends the bhaktivedanta purport. Swayambhuva Manu is seeking the attention of Karadvama Muni to consider his prayer with regard to something that is disturbing his mind or troubled by the affection for my daughter.

**Key Quote:** "It is his free will to be pleased or not be pleased with me."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the humility required in approaching a spiritual master, emphasizing that pleasing the guru is not about earning mercy through service, but about the guru's grace and free will.

Swayambhuva Manu was concerned about getting his daughter married and obviously he had in his mind Karadvama Muni. So he is saying here, O great sage, graciously be pleased to listen to the prayer of my humble self. This is how one addresses the spiritual master even if he has to, if he has to be addressed with respect to any request. See the humility. He is not just going and asking something. He is respecting him so much. He says, graciously be pleased. I am not saying that, I qualify that you be pleased with me. Graciously be pleased. Please be graceful. If someone asks somebody, please be pleased, I want you to be pleased with me. When is somebody pleased? When there is an exchange. The guru is pleased with the disciple when he receives service from the disciple. When he receives that, he is pleased with the disciple. But the disciple is thinking, just because I did service, even if he is pleased, it is because of his grace and not because of my contribution. Even if I do service, he need not be pleased. So he says, graciously be pleased. This is the way Swami Prabhupada Manu is addressing the spiritual master, as a disciple will address a spiritual master. So everywhere, in the relationship between guru and disciple, this is a very key point, that it is not a relationship of earning mercy or earning something by doing service to the spiritual master, you earn something. That is not the relationship. That is not the mood also. I will serve my spiritual master. It is his free will to be pleased or not be pleased

**Key Quote:** "It is only by his grace it is reaching Krishna."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that a disciple's service to the spiritual master is ultimately offered to Krishna, and it is through the guru's grace that the service becomes worthy of reaching Krishna, as the disciple is unqualified to serve Krishna directly.

with me. It is his own grace upon me, if he is pleased. That attitude is there because the disciple doesn't think that he can actually, he has the quality, humility to do pure devotional service to the Lord. The spiritual master is pleased with pure devotional service, because spiritual master, he is situated in a platform of absolute purity in his relationship with Krishna. So whatever service the living entity is offering to the spiritual master, naturally, the spiritual master doesn't want any service. He offers it to Krishna. Ekala, Ishvara, Krishna, Arasava, Brijya. Only Krishna is Ishvara. So a pure devotee of the Lord is offering pure devotional service. So when the disciple is offering service to spiritual master for Krishna to please him, the disciple knows that whatever I am offering is not worthy of going to Krishna. It is only by his grace it is reaching Krishna. The disciple never thinks that I can serve the spiritual master directly. I can serve Krishna directly. I can serve my spiritual master directly but I cannot serve Krishna directly. I have no qualification to serve Krishna directly. Krishna is surrounded and served by pure devotees of the Lord. So therefore, if at all my service has to reach Krishna, it is reaching Krishna because of the spiritual master's grace upon us. Whatever is lacking from the disciple, whatever the disciple offers to Krishna, it is pure devotional service. Whatever is lacking, the spiritual master compensates it and then offers it to the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "If you are getting attached to Krishna, it is because of the mercy of the spiritual master."
**Summary:** Using an analogy of needing 100 units of humility for service to reach Krishna, the speaker illustrates how the spiritual master compensates for the disciple's deficiencies and offers the perfected service to the Lord, emphasizing the guru's immense mercy.

This is his kindness. Suppose something, a quantity of let's say 100 is required. Just to give an example, 100 units of something is required. Say 100 units of humility is required for a service to go to Krishna. And we are offering service to the spiritual master. You may have one or you may have minus one or minus two or whatever. We offer that service to the spiritual master. The spiritual master, whether it is minus one or minus 100, he will make it plus 100 and offer it to Krishna because he sees something is there. So much is the transparent via media function of the spiritual master. So merciful he is. And if we are making advancement in Krishna consciousness, it is because of the mercy of the spiritual master. If you are getting attached to Krishna, it is because of the mercy of the spiritual master. If you are getting purified, it is due to the mercy of the spiritual master. That mercy, that is what graciously, the Lord is, the spiritual master, please be graciously be pleased with me. You cannot say, be pleased with me. Graciously be pleased with me. So sensitive, because he recognizes that in terms of his absolute goal of going back to Krishna is most unqualified. So in that mood, he is praying, Swayambhu Ammanu is praying to him.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One has to receive the message of the spiritual master regarding how to act in one's capacity for the spiritual master is expert in giving such instructions."
**Summary:** The speaker reads Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the importance of receiving instructions from a bona fide spiritual master and executing them according to one's capacity in Krishna Consciousness, highlighting the guru's role in guiding disciples towards perfection.

Previous translation: I have fortunately been instructed by you and thus great favor has been bestowed upon me. I thank God and I have listened with open ears to your pure words. Purport: Srila Rupa Goswami has given directions in his Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu on how to accept a bona fide spiritual master and how to deal with him. First, the desiring candidate must find a bona fide spiritual master and then he must very eagerly receive instructions from him and execute them. This is reciprocal service. A bona fide spiritual master, a saintly person always desires to elevate a common man who comes to him, because everyone is under the delusion of Maya and is forgetful of his prime duty, Krishna Consciousness. Saintly person always desires that everyone becomes a saintly person. It is the function of a saintly person to invoke Krishna Consciousness in every forgetful man. Manu said that he was advised and instructed by Kardama Muni he was very much favored. He considered himself lucky to receive the message, by oral reception. It is especially mentioned here that one should be very inquisitive to hear with open ears from the authorized source of a bona fide spiritual master. How is one to receive? One should receive the transcendental message by oral reception. The word Karna Randhrahey means through the holes of the ears. The favor of the spiritual master is not received through any other part of the body but the ears. This does not mean however that the spiritual master gives a particular type of mantra through the ears in exchange for some dollars and if the man meditates on that he achieves perfection and becomes God within six months. Such reception through the ears is bogus. The real fact is that a bona fide spiritual master knows the nature of a particular man and what sort of duties he can perform in Krishna Consciousness and he instructs him in that way. He instructs him through the ear not privately but publicly. You are fit for such and such a work in Krishna Consciousness you can act in this way. One person is advised to work in Krishna Consciousness by working in the deity's room another is advised to act in Krishna Consciousness by performing editorial work another is advised to do preaching work another is advised to carry out Krishna Consciousness in the cooking department. There are different departments of activities in Krishna Consciousness and the spiritual master knowing the particular ability of a particular man trains him in such a way that he becomes perfect. Bhagavad Gita makes it clear that one can attain the highest perfection in spiritual life simply by offering service according to his ability just as Arjuna served Krishna by his ability in the military art. Arjuna offered his service fully as a military man and he became perfect. Similarly an artist can attain perfection simply by performing artistic work on the direction of the spiritual master. If one is a literary man he can write articles and poetry for the service of God under the direction of the spiritual master. One has to receive the message of the spiritual master regarding how to act in one's capacity for the spiritual master is expert in giving

such instructions. This combination, the instruction of the spiritual master and the fateful execution of the instruction by the disciple, makes the entire process perfect. Srila Vishnu Achakravati Thakur describes in his explanation of his verse in Bhagavad Gita that one who wants to be certain to achieve spiritual success must take the instructions from the spiritual master as to what his particular function is. He should faithfully try to execute the particular instruction and should consider that his life and soul. The faithful execution of the instruction which he receives from the spiritual master is the only duty of a disciple and that will bring him perfection. One should be very careful to receive the instruction and execute it faithfully that will make one's life successful.

**Key Quote:** "This process is so powerful having the right faith in the process itself that the presence of Srila Prabhupada is not only right now in front of me and you is also there or in the altar and everywhere"
**Summary:** A devotee shares a commentary and a question, reminiscing about the time of Srila Prabhupada's physical presence and the strong faith and conviction that disciples had in serving him, even without direct personal access, and how they trusted the process of devotional service.

So, we were discussing last time. Anybody has any question of this? Ah, yes. Thank you so much Madhupandi Prabhu. It's a little commentary and then a question that I remember in your class you mentioned something very vital which was how in the time of the physical presence in the planet of his divine grace everybody knew that we could not be having the natural access, thousands of us there, and we were respecting the chain of authority in a natural way. Nobody was questioning at all and everyone felt the service toward Srila Prabhupada. And then the element was such conviction that this chain ended in Srila Prabhupada that every one of us very willingly renounced this need that came as a little child needs to be with the father personally. So, that was his mercy through his service for his mission. And one other element that was struck in my remembrance when you mentioned these things was that we knew that taking time of his service, his service was so valuable, he already asked us to leave him out of the management of our aspirations to do something. But there was one element that solved or at least for several of us that impediment, let's call it, or distance, it was that we could write Srila Prabhupada any moment but we knew also that there were hundreds of letters every day. In my memory I can still continue writing but never delivered it. These letters were accumulated and were checked by our own in the course of time because we were consider about his time for the service and then in due course of time we could see the letters being answered through the process of devotional service. And it's a very good practice even I regret I cannot do it now but I do in another way but it's very scientific and practical not having envy but most of them became too familiar. So this process is so powerful having the right faith in the process itself

**Summary:** The devotee continues sharing his commentary, emphasizing the importance of having faith in the spiritual master and recognizing their unlimited expansion as an intimate associate of the Lord, while acknowledging that the process of direct instruction was not always prevalent even during Srila Prabhupada's time.

that the presence of Srila Prabhupada is not only right now in front of me and you is also there or in the altar and everywhere not because again he is God but because he is a spiritual master I mean the liberated soul the intimate associate of the Lord can expand unlimitedly the difference with the Lord is that he cannot create any universe or anything but that power is with the spiritual master we need to have that faith only but also we need to have the spiritual master who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one are the physical I mean our soul has so much energy that ray we have to breathe up in that soul that is our soul we should 카 softly I cannot know it is This process, obviously, you know, at least grossly, did not happen even during Srila Prabhupada's preaching time in this planet. It did not happen. Grossly, it did not happen.

**Key Quote:** "If he has set up a system, that system, if it is properly followed, it will fulfill this function, 100%."
**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa explains that although Srila Prabhupada may not directly instruct every disciple, the system he established, with its management structure and association of devotees, is designed to fulfill the function of guiding disciples in Krishna consciousness.

Just like today also, that is not grossly happening. We are all disciples of Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada is not directly telling us, this is your quality, now this is what, this is the service you should do. He is not. Neither he did that during his time, nor now. Yet Srila Prabhupada is writing in the purport that this is a process. What does that mean? Some other way this is happening. Some other way this is happening. In other, which is the way it is happening, it is not very difficult to understand. Srila Prabhupada set up an institute, a mechanism of association of sadhus, devotees, who are all his disciples, who are all his followers. And within that he established a management structure, a way of receiving service, a way of associating and a way of progress in Krishna consciousness, which he amply demonstrated during his presence on this planet by writing so many letters, do like this, do like that, this, that, there are so many things. Including, why you are writing to me, all these questions you should ask your GBC. That also he has asked. Including sometimes he will say, why this, don't ask silly questions. That also he has asked. So, all kinds of answers he has given, very practical way he has given those. So, we are guided by the mechanism set up by him. Now, Srila Prabhupada is a pure devotee. He is an empowered representative of the Lord. If he has set up a system, that system, if it is properly followed, it will fulfill this function, 100%.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of having faith that Srila Prabhupada is still acting as a spiritual master for millions, guiding and assisting disciples through his all-pervading presence, just as Krishna is all-pervading.

Otherwise how Lord Chaitanya's mercy will spread to thousands and thousands of people, because you can find out that to have a pure devotee as a spiritual master itself is so rare. We have seen that. So many people try to become the, you know, sit in the temple. So many people try to become the, you know, sit in the temple. They are in the chain of discipline succession, replacing, trying to replace Prabhupada. And what happened? So, it is very clear that Srila Prabhupada is going to be the spiritual master for millions of living entities. How will Prabhupada do this function for millions of living entities? He can do it. He will do it. He is doing it. Even now he is doing it. This faith is required, because this process that... spiritual, just like Prabhupada said, my spiritual master is, I never, what is it, he is always with me. That is understanding. So in the same way, one should have faith that Prabhupada is always with me. Don't doubt that. He is always with every disciple. He is always with every disciple to guide, assist the devotee, to engage him in devotional service. That is the position of an acharya. How can Srila Prabhupada do that for millions? Yes, he is all-pervading. Just like Krishna is all-pervading for his service, Prabhupada is all-pervading. Therefore, he is always with the disciple. One should have faith in this principle that

**Key Quote:** "So the authority system that is there, which is properly situated, is non-different from Srila Prabhupada directly giving."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that the authority system established by Srila Prabhupada is non-different from his direct instructions, and one should have faith in the process, even if there are imperfections in the individuals within the system.

such principles are working among the devotee community. That is why progress is happening. So instead of Prabhupada directs, directly telling, this is your nature, this is the service you have to do, through the authority system it is happening. So the authority system that is there, which is properly situated, is non-different from Srila Prabhupada directly giving. At the same time, you cannot also, this also I explained last time, simultaneously one and different. Prabhupada directly giving and through institution it is, when he gave directly to few disciples, he gave directly to few disciples. That is what I am saying. That is what I am saying. That is what I am telling you. There is a difference. Definitely, that is very fortunate. There is a small difference of directly. When there is directly given then there is no question of any abuse. And it is, through the system, it is not one hundred percent, in the sense it could be one per here, it could be one. It could be same as, as as Prabhupada himself is directly telling It could be when Prabhupada is directly telling somebody it's only that. But when through the institution mechanism it is coming, it is meant to be same. But if there is an abuse of the system, then there is a problem. But for that I explained last time, that one should have faith in the person, in the process. If he has a faith in the process, it does not matter what is the purity or what is the level of, what is the Krishna conscious level of the person from whom you are receiving, as long as he is in that chain of system. Whatever it is, one should simply execute the instructions. One should not materially calculate all these things.

**Summary:** The speaker advises against getting caught up in material calculations and striving for material perfection in devotional service, emphasizing the importance of living in the present moment and serving the Lord to the best of one's ability with a good spirit.

We are practicing. We are practicing bhakti. One should not think that, okay, now, see, I have been asked to go to, I have, you know, I have been asked to go to somewhere, to go to Vrindavan by, you know, my authority told me to go by Indian Airlines or Air India flight. Then I went and checked, I found out it was, okay, I went and came back also. I did my job. Afterwards I found out that Indigo, you know, was, you know, 100 rupees cheaper. How my authority gave me this instruction? We lost 100 rupees for Krishna. All these material calculation you should not see. It will happen. Everybody is, you know, there is perfect, materially perfectness, perfectness is different. The spirit of perfectness is what we are practicing here. So many things we are doing, devotional service in this material, in this, don't get into that material perfection. The way we run this temple, 10 years back was different, today, much improved materially. 10 years back, how we run this temple, if you see, you will see, hey, hey, hey, really, it was so silly. You are doing this mistake. Now we are done. 10 more years from now, you will see it will be materially much more perfect. So some devotees get into this material rightness and wrongness. That is not what we are practicing. We are practicing here, live in the present, whatever maturity you have in good spirit, best of your ability, you serve the Lord, and then go on.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The principle of Guru is coming from all directions"
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes that taking one's assigned duty as given by Krishna and executing it is the same as Arjuna receiving instruction from Krishna, and that the principle of Gurutva, or the essence of the guru's teachings, can be learned from various sources, including karmis and new bhaktas.

So that is, that spirit of receiving the service and executing the service as an instruction from the spiritual master, why in Prabhupada's purport, in Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, now Prabhupada goes one level up. He says, Oh, you may say that Krishna was before Arjuna, so he could give him instruction directly. How is it that I am, you know, but we don't have Krishna before us to follow his instruction? So Prabhupada says, no, if one simply takes his assigned duty, as given by Krishna and executed, it is the same as Arjuna. As Arjuna received instruction from Krishna so it's a very mystical process you cannot go by this gross bodily arrangement and feel completely confused we are in a spiritual life, it's a spiritual process Prabhupada is not physically limited for the sake of being worshipped he is in a deity form so that we can offer dress we can offer flowers, we can offer arati we can pray grossly, obeisances therefore he is there doesn't mean he is only there he is everywhere for the disciple he is always with him to help the disciple and he works through, his help comes through so many so many medium it comes through the principle of Guru is coming from all directions we learn something from Karmis also some Karmis say something that principle Gurutva you have faith in your spiritual master that Gurutva you can pick up from anywhere the Lord Paramatma is everywhere and he teaches the disciple from every source he will from your God brothers you will learn from a new Bhakta you will learn sometimes from a Karmis whom you are going and preaching Krishna consciousness suddenly you will see that he will give the answer for something that you had a big question about so

this process is working and I will progress in spiritual life if I have faith in the faith to follow Srila Prabhupada and I also last time talked about this going very sharply what exactly I should do now that parallel don't get into that paralysis mental paralysis in fact even normally speaking also let us say you go to a shop electronic shop you want to buy one phone you go to a big showroom you will see about hundred models isn't that? hundred possibilities are there as a Jeeva your ability to exercise your free will is also limited in other words your free will can get paralyzed is it not? if you buy one you will think oh okay you bought one oh then you will say oh I should have bought that one or you choose that one then you should have bought that one that was there this is the way it is in other words the more the choices we have the more our free will will get frozen isn't it? we are tiny living entities we have limited free will we are guided by the you know processes if you go into analyzing too much what I should do today what I should do now what I should do tomorrow every tiny detail I should know somebody should tell me then only I am 100% surrendered to Krishna then I should do this I know that whatever I am doing is what Krishna is saying, Krishna wants me to do. If Krishna is going to tell you every moment what you should do, raise your right hand, you know, left hand, it's ridiculous, isn't it? It doesn't work like that. That's why I call that as analysis paralysis.

**Summary:** A devotee adds to the discussion, and the speaker explains how any attempt to short-circuit the process given by Prabhupada will be ejected by the system, using examples of conflicts between gurus and temple management, and emphasizing that the current system is the Prabhupada Acharya system, not the rithvik system.

Yeah. Hare Krishna Prabhu, just to add on to what you already said. Even today in the opposite camp, the gurus are separate and the management is separate. I mean, they don't get into the management and all those things is what I heard. So even there also, they're not getting directly from their own gurus any instruction to do service or what? Correct. See, what has happened, what is happening is, anybody who tries to short circuit the process given by Prabhupada, invariably the system will eject. That is what is happening, because Prabhupada and Krishna is so intelligent that you just cannot, you know, for some time you may play, but you will see that there is a problem in institution, immediately GBC will meet together and they will say, this is a problem. I think in the temple hall, guru puja is a problem. One resolution, no guru pujas in the temple or they will say, okay, here, there is a problem that this, the temple president is telling this and the guru comes in, visit the temple and the temple president says, you know, this devotee is not doing, you know, pujari service that pujari, that pujari will say, Prabhu, I will ask my guru, this is happening in other temples. I'll ask my guru. Whatever my guru says, I will do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And the guru, it depends. I mean, the guru, if he's a very important disciple, he gave a lot of gurudakshina and things like that. Then he's thinking, how I can displease him? He wants a change of service. So he'll call temple president. He'll say, please give him change of service. Then he'll say, no Maharaj, how can I do, you know, I know that pujari is, no, no, no, you do it. Or he's little hesitant, when he is little hesitant, the disciple will go outside and say to all his godbrothers, he will say, see, temple president does not respect our guru. Then there is whole politics there. All of them gang up against the temple president. So GBC discussed all these things. Yes, it is a fact. Let us make a resolution. The resolution is gurus have no authority to instruct their disciples regarding their service. Resolution. Eject. Out of the system, eject. Either the institution system should be there or guru system should be there. When Prabhupada was there, both were one. Guru system and institution was one. So that like this kind of resolution, they end up in making all these things. So even. See, they are unwillingly following the rithvik system. The other is gone, is unwillingly following the rithvik system. Forced to follow the rithvik system. If you ask someone of their gurus, you ask them, you know what, Madhupandi, I'm actually a rithvik only, the guru says. Then somebody else will say, no, why don't you just come together? You know. See, practically we are, you know, everything is a rithvik system. When we are happily following, why we should come and, you know, follow in, you know, in a hidden manner, rithvik system. Prabhupada has very blessed us and we are very fortunate, we have a wonderful, open, freely following Prabhupada Acharya system. In fact, we shouldn't even call this system rithvik system. That doesn't work. They are the one who gave that name. This is not the rithvik system. Just like Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, Prabhupada Acharya system it is. Any time in future somebody says, you know, you're following rithvik system, no, no, we are following Prabhupada Acharya system. We are from the Acharya Sampradaya. Prabhupada Acharya system. We are from the Acharya Sampradaya system.

**Key Quote:** "Sukha Dukha, material Sukha Dukha for the body and the mind, is fixed for everybody when one takes birth."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Sukha and Dukha (happiness and distress) are fixed at birth, but not in a way that eliminates free will.

The forces of the mind and the body and the senses that rise up. How we manage those things? We are given guidelines by Krishna and Bhagavad Gita, by our Acharya, by the Purvacharyas. How you conduct your life in a manner in which you handle these urges? We handle these natural, bodily, mental urges. We cannot deny that these urges are not there. Nobody can deny. We have taken this body in this material world for enjoying, so therefore the Lord has mercifully given this body, just like every karma He gives, He gives us a body according to our karma. This body has got a certain value. It has got a certain potential of Sukha and Dukha, which is unveiled, it's a function of time. Tomorrow on Sukha Dukha, day after tomorrow on Sukha Dukha, next year, 100 years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now, it's a function of Kala, Sukha Dukha. But Prabhupada says and the Shastra says that Sukha Dukha is a function of time. It's a function of time. It's a function of time. So Sukha Dukha, material Sukha Dukha for the body and the mind, is fixed for everybody when one takes birth. It is fixed. Sukha and Dukha is an experience. So Sukha Dukha is fixed. Not that this particular Sukha is fixed, this particular Dukha is fixed. Not that the full chart of where all you will get Sukha, where all you will get Dukha is fixed. That is not what it means. That is not what it means.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how devotees can manage pleasure and pain by using their 'currency' in Krishna's service, burning off 'Dukkha currency' through austerities.

What the devotee does is what? He uses that currency for Krishna's service. The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat and cold, misery and happiness. A Krishna conscious person is above duality because he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of Krishna. Just see, when you take trouble to serve Prabhupada and Krishna, bodily, mental struggle you take against your wish. Tapasya means against your default mode. Now your present wish is to serve Prabhupada and Krishna. But there is a default mode, lazy fellow, all these kind of things, don't want to do, live happily. All this kind of philosophy, you know, concocted, karmi philosophy will be there. If the devotee is having the, you know, has determined to work hard for Prabhupada, take trouble for Prabhupada, sweat for Prabhupada, take tension for Prabhupada, take anxiety for Prabhupada, please understand that you are burning your Dukkha currency. If you don't take trouble for Prabhupada. If you don't take trouble for Prabhupada. If you don't take trouble for Prabhupada. If you don't take tension for Prabhupada, if you don't take anxiety for Prabhupada, Dukkha will come to you some other way, which is not service of Krishna. It may even stop service of Krishna, right? If you become very sick, then you will not be able to even do service, isn't it? Now I am talking about how devotees manage pleasure and pain. In Kota, which is there as per law of karma, management of pleasure and pain.

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So secret number one is, take authorized austerities."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of taking authorized austerities in Krishna consciousness to avoid struggling for material existence.

So secret number one is, take authorized austerities. One of the things that disturb ones most in life, for everybody is what? When problems come. Isn't it? Nobody likes problems. So better we take voluntarily problems. In this material world, to preach Krishna consciousness is very problematic. To raise funds is very problematic. To convince somebody is very problematic. You need patience, tolerance, be behind him, be behind him, be behind him. Be behind him. You have to put chest. To make one devotee, right? Or you take up a project, you have to be behind it. Every problems that the karmas have in building a project, the devotee will also have to face. So all these things when we do for Krishna, it has got very high value to make our devotional life peaceful. Therefore austerity should be taken. So many times in different classes I have told, in Krishna consciousness after you have come, if you don't struggle for your spiritual, for service, if you don't struggle to control your senses, then you will be made to struggle for material existence. Struggle will not be, that struggle will not be taken away. When you struggle for material existence, it is useless. It doesn't help you in any way. It's all temporary. When you struggle for Krishna consciousness, it is giving you eternal benefit. So, where do you, suppose you say, anyway you have to struggle. If you struggle here, you will get something for this life. If you struggle here, you will get something eternal for your soul. Which will you choose? This is intelligent management. Therefore, we should struggle.

Maybe you don't want to be in one shot and finish your 16 rounds. After few rounds your mind will say something else. No. Take austerity. Do it. Finish it.

Prabhupada, today I have decided, 10 hours I am going to stand like this. Why? No, tapasya. So that I can burn off my, you know, papa bijas. No, tapasya.

Oh, I have to do tapasya Prabhu, you told me. No, Mondays I will fast and Fridays I will fast. No. These are all good for karmas. Yes, it helps them, encourages them. Every kind of austerity. Austerity for pleasing Shiva, austerity for pleasing Ganesha. Monday for Shiva I will fast. Thursday I will fast for Ganesha. Monday for Shiva I will fast. Thursday I will fast for Ganesha. Thursday I will fast for Ganesha. All this they have. Let them do. But we want to do those austerities which are pleasing to Vishnu, to the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that even within bona fide austerities, there are specific guidelines given by the spiritual master, using the example of visiting Radha Kunda.

So we have to be very careful in simply, that is another extreme. Some devotees go into this whole austerity mode and all this kind of things. So there are bona fide austerities. So there are bona fide austerities. Within even those bona fide austerities, Srila Prabhupada has given us, even within these bona fide austerities, again a set of austerities. Why he has given a set of austerities? Just suppose somebody says, oh I want to go to Radha Kunda and chant every day 64 rounds. See, it is a, how can you say no, it is not a good austerity. Now you have to again see what our bona fide, our spiritual master has told us. Now you have to again see what our bona fide, our spiritual master has told us. Stand 16 rounds nicely, probably another 10 lives. Then one day you will go to Radha Kunda. There is a stage for everything. Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur used to blast any disciple if he goes to Radha Kunda and sits. He said, you are not qualified even to dip in Radha Kunda. He said, you are not qualified even to dip in Radha Kunda. He said, you are not qualified even to dip in Radha Kunda. Even Prabhupada, I think only once or something he went dip, but afterwards he stopped. Because all the foreign disciples started swimming and everything in Radha Kunda.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights that hearing the holy name of the Lord is the greatest tapasya in this age, despite being easier than other forms of austerity.

In fact, the greatest tapasya that one can do in this age is to hear the holy name of the Lord. See, tapasya can be known, can be understood by two means. One is how difficult it is. Another is what is the result of it. See, don't mistake, always tapasya means pain. It's not so. There are authorized tapasyas. Each tapasya has a pain and a result. If you take chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra, the hearing of Hare Krishna Mahamantra, definitely is not so difficult as standing on one leg for 10 hours. Right? Much easier. But the result of that one hearing of Hare Krishna cannot be compared to 100 years of standing on one leg. So that's what you have to understand.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the need for an Acharya's guidance to properly understand the scriptures and apply them to one's life.

Don't think that tapasya only means, you know, tapasya means authorized tapasas. Authorized tapasas, authorized austerity, because there is some, definitely some tapas is there in hearing because mind goes here and there. But it is not, it is, it is, it is easy, easier than many other tapasyas. But the value of this tapasya is something which is, what is revealed in the scriptures. Discounted tapasya for Kali Yuga. Just simply you hear then you get, you know, the results of so many Ashwamedha Yajna, Shastras. Even then you cannot equal to this tapasya of hearing this Hare Krishna Mahamantra. So, we have to be very careful in understanding purport of Prabhupada, understanding these verses. That is why an Acharya's guidance is required. Otherwise you will misunderstand. Otherwise from Bhagavatam, whatever you want, you can get. All kinds of stories are there. Whatever you want to justify, you will get it. Sometimes devotees, sometimes devotees also argue, no, no, actually Bhagavatam is for Grahasthas. And the Paramahamsas say, no, no, Bhagavatam is a Paramahamsa Shastra. It is for Paramahamsas. The fact is that for those who want to practice Vaishnavism, it is available for everybody, irrespective of any Ashrama. Bhagavatam caters to Grahasthas. Bhagavatam caters to Paramahamsas also. So such an all-encompassing literature is Srimad Bhagavatam. Therefore we need guidance. How it is applicable to each. And that is how I explain now.

What about Sukha? That also is there in the purse everyday. It is delivered in the plate, Sukha and Dukha, everyday. Just like Dukha comes without asking, Sukha also comes without asking. Now again, don't think that Sukha means that specific Sukha. Then you have no free will. No. Suppose a specific Sukha is pushed upon you, then you have no free will at all. So there is a Sukha. Now whether you want to, what do you want to do with this Sukha? This is another very important clue, how to manage our pleasure and pain. Now pain management, I have told. Pleasure management, I will tell. How pleasure management? You can decide what to take pleasure in, you have got a free will. Just like you have got pleasure currency, either you can buy it, you know, tomatoes or orange or apple or what you want to buy, you can buy. Currency is fixed and you have to spend it by evening. It's a force on the body. It's a Vega in the body. Pleasure Vega is coming in the body, in the mind. Pleasure Vega is coming. You have to spend it. And I told you, to spend it, you can decide what to take pleasure in. What is it? You have got the freedom to decide what to take pleasure in. But pleasure you have to take everyday.

**Summary:** The speaker advises devotees to take pleasure in chanting, devotional service, and all work done for Krishna to manage their pleasure quota.

So what should we take pleasure in? Chanting, devotion service, dancing, taking prashadam. Take pleasure in every work that you do for Prabhupada and Krishna. Everyday your pleasure management of your body-mind system is taken care of. But you have to take pleasure. That is very important. All of you can research. Go into Prabhupada folio and see. Taking pleasure. About 300 times Prabhupada has written. Taking pleasure. That means it is your free will. You should take pleasure in Brahmanical life. You should take pleasure in sadhana. You should take pleasure in your work. See somebody is, let us say, the person is thinking, oh this is very, you know, I have to work, I have to work, I have to work, I have to work. Then he is not, that days all pleasure currency is piling up. By evening, by night he is frustrated. Because his pleasure currency is not burnt. And finally that pleasure currency will come out of some gross sense enjoyment. Very important. Somewhere it has to go, sensual pleasure it will come out. Those who enjoy their service, whatever it may be, even if it is difficult work, take pleasure. Do you know the secret that you can take pleasure in things which are painful also?

These are all big tricks of the mind. You can take pleasure in a painful thing. Painful for the body, painful for the mind, but pleasure for the soul. So you can take pleasure, just like tapasya also you can take pleasure. So taking pleasure in chanting, taking pleasure in everything that you do, taking pleasure in the service, because nearly 8-10 hours, 7-8 hours you are spending in service. So the mood in which you do service is very important for you to control your senses. You have to learn how to enjoy your service. Enjoy means not that, enjoy means not enjoy the content of the service. Enjoy doing service. You have to take pleasure in doing service to Krishna. I like it.

**Key Quote:** "At the same time we don't get bound by karma. In the same time, if we are freed from sinful expressions of pain and pleasure."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses managing pleasure and pain to avoid karma, emphasizing bona fide expressions of pleasure in Krishna consciousness.

At the same time we don't get bound by karma. In the same time, if we are freed from sinful expressions of pain and pleasure. There are bona fide expressions of pain and pleasure. Taking prasadam is bona fide pleasure, expression of pleasure. Right? Eating nonsense, it is not a bona fide pleasure. So there are bona fide expressions of pleasure and pain, pleasure and pain in our Krishna consciousness life, that Prabhupada has given us. And you take pleasure and do it. Take pleasure in honoring prasadam. Take pleasure in kirtan. Somebody may say, no, take pleasure is all artificial. How can I take pleasure? It should become pleasurable. Anything before it becomes pleasurable, you have to take pleasure. This is another rule. Because pleasure is a combination of something from outside and your decision to enjoy. Your pleasure potency. Each of us have a tiny pleasure potency. We are sample of God. If you don't decide to take pleasure, even outside thing if it is pleasurable also, you will not feel pleasure. Both have to mix together.

**Key Quote:** "Because pleasure is a combination of something from outside and your decision to enjoy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that pleasure is a combination of external stimuli and the individual's decision to enjoy, highlighting the role of free will.

Hydrogen is gas. Oxygen is gas. Mix hydrogen and oxygen, you get something which is water, liquid. The property of water is neither of hydrogen or oxygen. Yes? In the same way, if you take my contribution of giving pleasure potency is hydrogen. Sense object is oxygen. Only when they mix together, you get what is sense gratification. Sense gratification is a combination of sense enjoyer and sense object. Is it not? So therefore, you have trained yourself, you have conditioned yourself to enjoy something. It simply means that you have already taught your mind to take pleasure in it. That is why now, you are not consciously taking pleasure. But you have trained your mind to take pleasure in it. It is already set inside. If you have not taken pleasure in it, you will not find, you will not, you know, you have to teach yourself fresh how to enjoy. Every enjoyment is not automatic. Every enjoyment that we have with the sense object, it is all learnt. From childhood slowly it is learnt. This is pleasurable. Okay, I will take pleasure in it. You see such a big role, this taking pleasure, free will to take pleasure. In the actual final pleasure experience, your taking pleasure is such an important factor.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of managing pleasure and pain through authorized means in Krishna consciousness to achieve a peaceful mind.

So we have to take pleasure in bona fide expressions of pleasure, which are many in Krishna consciousness movement, authorized for us as a Brahmachari, as a Grihastha, whatever, it is plenty. So this way, if we manage our expressions of pleasure and pain, Kota, which is in our destiny, as long as we have this body, that force is there. So as long as, if we can manage that in this, using these two formulas, then our mind will be peaceful. Mind cannot become sober, when there is pain and pleasure, these two things pull the mind apart, these dualities. You cannot be a sober person, you cannot be a dheera, dheera means sober, adheera means pleasure pulls, pain pulls, your consciousness, pleasure and pain may be there, but your consciousness is pulled up and down. So a dheera is one whose consciousness is not pulled up and down. So that your consciousness is not pulled up and down, you have to minimize the pull of pleasure and pain, by management of your pleasure and pain, Kota. So that the mind is peaceful, and it can execute positive devotional service.

Hare Krishna. Any questions? Yes. Hare Krishna. When we do our chanting very nicely, by taking lot of tapasya, this pleasure and dukkha, whatever we have, get managed throughout the day, mystically or in a very automatic way? Yes, it manages, because two things you are already doing, taking pleasure in chanting, and while taking pleasure in chanting, while you are taking pleasure in chanting, you are doing austerity with your mind and body, which doesn't take pleasure. It wants freedom. You tell sit in one place and chant, it doesn't want. Mind and body is, by default goes in another direction. So you learn how to take pleasure, with your soul, and you are taking pain with your body and mind, lot of your Kota is burnt out. Whole day you can remain a Dheera.

But if you do what a pure devotee has told, on a day to day basis we can be a Dheera. Today you can be a Dheera, if you have done this chanting nicely. Tomorrow if you don't do chanting, you will be a Dheera. Whereas a pure devotee, who is fixed in Krishna consciousness, he is always Dheera.

So today we will talk about the glories of the holy name of the Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna, the Sarvakarnakara, means the cause of all causes. He is the supreme original cause of the entire existence. He is working as per the scheme of the Supreme Lord, Lord Krishna. The purpose of material existence is Him. Everything, including us, this material energy, everything that we see here and beyond matter, the Vaikunthaloka, everything is emanating from Him as the supreme cause. So this is this consciousness that Krishna, everything is Krishna and or His energies, display of His energies, is what is the consciousness called Krishna consciousness. We are also tiny persons, part and parcel of God. As tiny persons, all the characteristics of a tiny person, if you study that, he can think, he can feel, he can will, he can have ego, he can enjoy, he can live, he can have ego, he can enjoy, he can love, he can possess. If you take all these characteristics, just like a drop of ocean is salty as much as the quality of the entire ocean is, quality quantity is less, in the same way, we are able to see that in this body there is a soul, there is a person who is having all these personhood features, and the body does not have these personhood features. This body does not have thinking, feeling, willing, egoing, does not have this. It's all coming from the resident of this body. Body is a dead matter. The body is no different from any machine, but in illusion we think we are the body. So Krishna, the supreme lord, is also a person, person of, we are persons of tiny consciousness, he is a person of infinite consciousness. We are persons of different limited control of limited energies around us, like this body and bodily control over things outside the body, and this control is only temporary. If you extend that characteristic to Krishna, Krishna is the supreme proprietor of everything in existence, being the cause of all causes, he is in eternal control of everything in existence. Unlike us, we are in control of things according to karma, little control. Today somebody is rich, today someone will be poor, tomorrow someone will possess something, today tomorrow he will lose that possession. But Krishna is the eternal possessor of all existence, being the supreme lord. We have to think about all these things which the shastras describe, the characteristic of Bhagavan, and we have to contemplate on this, what is the vedic conception of Krishna, because the absolute sense, if you get the right conception of Krishna, that is Krishna. Krishna and his conception, absolute conception as received from guru, sadhu and shastra, are not different from Krishna himself. So as a prelude to speaking about Krishna's name, I have given introduction to Krishna's personality. Krishna, the supreme absolute person, cause of all causes, the supreme persons, person of all the small persons, and what is our relationship with that supreme person, that we are his part and parcel. We are his, we have forgotten, we eternally belong to him. We have forgotten our love for Krishna. Krishna never forgets his love for any of his part and parcel. Krishna's love is unconditional. So therefore, he seated in our heart even in our journey into this material world. Now the most important thing to understand the difference between Krishna and us, which will give us good realization of the holy name, is that Krishna, Krishna, Krishna and his energies and his energies for him are completely one, are completely one, because everything is coming from him, everything is a manifestation of his, his energy is his activity. If you say this material energy is Krishna's, it means it is an expansion of his activity, he created it, he originated it. So anything we began talking that Krishna is a cause of all causes, is a cause of all causes, therefore if we vibrate his name, his name because Krishna, because Krishna everything is Krishna's energy, if we vibrate his name with devotion, with devotion, then that is nothing but an extension of Krishna from the spiritual world. For Krishna there is no limitation of time, space and substance. Only one law governs Krishna, only one law governs Krishna, love. By love we can, by love we can endear ourselves to Krishna and this is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teaching

**Summary:** This segment discusses Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's role in bringing the Hare Krishna mantra to the world and emphasizes that the mantra's vibration continues through the disciplic succession.

and how and and on the premise the absolute truth that we all have love of Krishna but it is covered now by this material energy so Krishna in order to give an opportunity to the conditioned souls to awaken their love for Krishna to awaken their love towards their complete whole we are part and he is a whole to give an opportunity for that Krishna himself comes years back as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and He gives, He brings forth from the spiritual world this vibration, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has brought forth this vibration and this vibration is continuing through disciplic succession even to this date. The very same vibration that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu brought down. Vibration of the Lord is non-different from the Lord. Name of the Lord is non-different from the Lord. So that vibration, as I explained, beyond time, space and substance. Beyond time, that vibration that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu vibrated because beyond time, the Acharyas in our parampara, when they vibrate the name, it is the very same name that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu brought down from the spiritual world, Shuddhanama.

**Key Quote:** "Shuddhanama infuses invests all He's energies into the vibration that we generate with our tongue and that energies are satt Chaitananda energies."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concepts of Shuddhanama (pure name) and Shakti Avesha Nama (empowered name), explaining how the pure name infuses energy into the sound we chant and purifies our hearts.

And that Shuddhanama, one can get, not directly. That Shuddhanama which is coming in parampara, first acts upon us. That Shuddhanama which is coming in parampara, first acts upon us, by sending, by descending His Satchidananda Shakti effulgence into the sound that we chant. The sound that we utter is called Shakti Avesha Nama, because Shuddhanama cannot be chanted with the material tongue. Because Shuddhanama cannot be chanted with the material tongue. So Shuddhanama infuses, invests all He's energies into the vibration that we generate with our tongue and that energies are Sat, Chaitananda energies. And therefore, Nama worship. Rama worship. Nama worship means you are worshipping Shuddha Nama only. But in the beginning you worship Shuddha Nama from a distance by worshipping Shakti Avaishanama. By worshipping Shakti Avaishanama, you get association of the Shakti Avaishanama. When you get the association of Shakti Avaishanama, you get purified. Satya energy, Chitya energy, Ananda energies are energies that will purify our heart. So why Japa, the spiritual master, gives us the holy name in the form of the Shakti Avaishanama to start with. And when you are qualified, what it means? Qualified means, you awaken your spiritual tongue and your spiritual mind. The spiritual master will reveal Prema Nama, Shuddha Nama, which will give us Krishna Prema.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "When our attention touches that sound, our attention becomes purified."
**Summary:** This segment describes the Hare Krishna mantra as the Nama Avatara (sound incarnation) in Kali Yuga, emphasizing the importance of attentive hearing to purify one's consciousness.

So therefore, a Sadhaka has to very seriously worship the Nama Avatara, the sound incarnation of the Lord. And in Kali Yuga, this particular name Nama Avatara is in the form of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. And we all are aware that this is proved by the fact that today this Nama Avatara He is... He is giving out the mercy, has already given out the mercy all over the world to souls from different religion, different countries, everywhere. They all have received this Nama spread all over the world in this particular form. It's Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. So, this Nama Avatara is like one sun, Surya of Satchidananda. Just like one sun reflects on so many water bodies on this earth, but the sun is one. In the same way, one Nama Prabhu is reflecting on millions of tongues who vibrate and infuses Satya, Chitta and Ananda energies into that sound. So that, that sound when we hear, consciously when we hear, when our attention touches that sound, our attention becomes purified. Right now, our attention is influenced by Raja Guna, Tama Guna and Satya Guna. When we say we are influenced by three gunas, what does it mean? It means my attention is influenced by these three gunas. Therefore, this attention needs to be purified. This attention touches the Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. You have to electrify the attention. Satchidananda eyes the attention. And how can you do that? By constant attention touch of the sound incarnation of the Lord.

### Attentive Chanting, Offering Thoughts, Worship of Vibration

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Simply offer that problem to the fire of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare."
**Summary:** This segment provides practical advice on how to chant attentively, suggesting to offer distracting thoughts to the holy name and emphasizing that chanting and hearing are forms of worship.

This is a secret. That's all, as simple as that. How long you keep the attention touch? How continuously you keep the attention touch? How steadily you keep the attention touch? How undiluted from any other task you keep the attention touch? That much rapid, immediate progress is made by association of the Holy Name. One of the reasons why we see very slow effect on our consciousness when we chant Hare Krishna, is because our consciousness does not touch the Holy Name. Consciousness touches, our consciousness touches through attentive hearing. So, the ocean of Satchidananda, Surya of Satchidananda, non-different from Krishna, Krishna himself has taken avatar to save us from this material world, by giving us association. And we will be absolutely foolish, if we do not take this avatar that appears on our tongue, into our heart, through the process of attentive hearing. How you start with chanting one mantra, then you chant the next mantra, then you chant the next mantra, and if your attention is going away to some other thinking, then you are calling the Holy Name of the Lord in vain. In vain means you are not utilizing the purpose for which the Lord has appeared. The Lord has come down as the Surya of Satchidananda. Everything that we try in this material world, even as karmas or when our mind is attempting to do so many things during japa, it is all about chasing Satchita and Ananda. All activities are about that. So if you have faith that this Holy Name is the reservoir of all Satchitananda, then any thought that comes to disturb, you should simply, just like ghee is offered in the fire, offer it into the vibration and don't continue thinking about it. Thoughts will come, problems will come, you think about the problems during japa. Simply offer that problem to the fire of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Because this fire is Yajna, this Nama is Krishna, this vibration is Krishna. Into the fire, into this Yajna, Purusha, Yuga Sankirtana. At that time, at the time of japa, we should completely absorb in worshipping this vibration and the way to worship this vibration, not by folding hands. If you see the form of the Lord, fold hands. Worship means something with the body we do, pay obeisances, worship. How do you worship the vibration? With which part of the body? Tongue, and ears, and mind.

### Worship of Nama Avatara, Faith, Realization

**Key Quote:** "When you are chanting Hare Krishna, Krishna is dancing on your tongue."
**Summary:** This segment explains how to worship the Nama Avatara through chanting and hearing, emphasizing the importance of faith and the gradual process of realization.

So it's a very simple worship. Just like you offer worship to Krishna's form, with your hand, you take agarbatti and you offer. Same way, very simple. Use your tongue, chant, and then hear the holy name. You are worshipping Nama Avatara. Anybody who becomes a worshipper of Nama Avatara, becomes a devotee of Nama Avatara, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, his life is done. One should not think that I am mechanically doing 16 rounds every day. You should think, two hours I am sitting to worship the Lord in His vibrational form. And there is no difference between this vibrational form and the deity form, or the original Supreme Personality of God, in the spiritual world. Realization may be distant. When you are chanting Hare Krishna, Krishna is dancing on your tongue. Realization that He is dancing on the tongue may be distant. But the truth of the Shastra, that Shastra reveals, He is incarnated, He is there. So therefore, in japa, before we get realization, we need to have Shraddha. So with Shraddha, in the Shastra, Shraddha means, you feel the truth. You feel that this is true, that here is Krishna. And then you feel the truth also, that I am distant from Him, because of my impurities. In terms of consciousness, I am distant from Him, because I am a Sadaka. I will worship Him, I will worship Him in this way, and I will purify myself, and when I awaken my bhakti, then there is no difference between me and Him.

### respect, super-soul, Vaishnava etiquette
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/N8YK8REL7t0?t=0
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Offering respect to his devotee is more valuable than offering respect to him."
**Summary:** This segment explains that offering respect to a Vaishnava is offering respect to Vishnu, as Vaishnavas are temples of Vishnu, and that respect is ultimately offered to the super-soul within.

It may be argued that since Daksha was the father-in-law of Lord Shiva, it was certainly the duty of Lord Shiva to offer him respect. In answer to that argument, it is explained here that when a learned person stands up or offers obeisances in welcome, he offers respect to the super-soul who is sitting within everyone's heart. It is seen, therefore, among Vaishnavas that even when a disciple offers obeisance to a spiritual master, the spiritual master immediately returns the obeisances because they are mutually offered not to the body but to the super-soul. Therefore, the spiritual master also offers respect to the super-soul situated in the body of the disciple. The Lord says in Srimad Bhagavatam that offering respect to his devotee is more valuable than offering respect to him. Devotees do not identify with the body. So, offering respect to a Vaishnava means offering respect to Vishnu. It is stated there also that as a matter of etiquette, as soon as one sees a Vaishnava, one must immediately offer him respect, indicating the super-soul sitting within. A Vaishnava sees the body of a temple of Vishnu. Since Lord Shiva already has offered respect to the super-soul in Krishna consciousness, offering respect to Daksha, who has identified with the body, was already performed, there is no need to offer respect to his body, for that is not directed by any Vedic injunction. Thus ends.

### social convention, transcendental understanding, respect

**Key Quote:** "Father-in-law should be respected more, must be respected by the son-in-law."
**Summary:** This segment differentiates between social conventions of respect and the transcendental understanding of offering respect to the super-soul, noting that social conventions dictate respecting elders like a father-in-law.

So, a very important principle, Srimad Bhagavatamin Θahahaha D sympathy, kenasṁ davanti één ye que Caitanya who does not believe Therefrom and contemplate only the He is being explained by Lord Shiva to his young wife, Sati. Basically, Lord Shiva is saying that I never disrespected Dakshya. There is a social convention, which is first line. Certainly, friends and relatives offer mutual greetings by standing up, welcoming one another and offering obeisances. This is Vivaharik social convention. Next he says, Paramarthi, those who are elevated to transcendental platform being intelligent, offer such respects to super souls. Those who are sitting within the body, not to the person who identifies with the body. So, the two different perspectives. And Lord Shiva is saying that those who understand the soul, the super soul and the body, which is the body of, which the soul identifies with, the three things. There is nothing much to explain about the social convention. There is not much philosophy in it. Socially somebody is more respectable, less respectable, no doubt. Father-in-law should be respected more, must be respected by the son-in-law. These are social conventions.

**Key Quote:** "When we give respect to the super soul, the pure soul is included in it."
**Summary:** This segment explains that transcendentalists act based on pure knowledge, giving respect to the super-soul within the body and not to the false ego, including the pure soul in that respect.

When it comes to the transcendental understanding of giving respect, it is, everything that the transcendentalist does, is based on knowledge, pure knowledge. So, externally the act may be the same as, the other act, same as the social act. But, the way the transcendentalists do the act, why they do the act, is different. Lord Shiva is explaining here that when a person who is enlightened about the things as they are, then they, when they, they give respects to the super soul within the body and not to the false ego. When we give respect to the super soul, the pure soul is included in it. The pure soul or the awakened soul or the pure soul in a body which is driven by false ego, is practically sleeping. So, one gives obeisances to the super soul. There is nothing, the soul who is accompanied with the super soul or the super soul is accompanied by the soul, either way, they are never separated. False ego is separated, soul is separated, in the mind of an enlightened person. And he gives, he offers his obeisances to the super soul and the soul. And the soul is not the false ego because they have identified with the body. That here, Lord Shiva clearly says, not to the person who identifies with the body.

### obeisances, social convention, internal consciousness

**Key Quote:** "Paying obeisances, physically, or paying obeisances in the mind, is no difference as far as the internal consciousness of the enlightened person is concerned."
**Summary:** This segment discusses whether obeisances are paid to the soul or only the super-soul, explaining that paying respects to someone identified with the material body is a social convention, while enlightened individuals pay respects internally to the soul and super-soul.

So, is it that we never pay obeisances, we never pay respects to the soul? Do we pay respects only to the super soul? No, no, no, no, no. Anybody who is, person who is identified with the, with the material body, to that person is, if you pay obeisances, then that is social. False ego. Devotees are not interested in that. Interested means they act out of, out of transcendental platform. That doesn't mean they don't act, they don't, they are not affected. Even if, let us say, somebody is, because Krishna says, even self-realized person, they act within the conventions of this material world. Just to set example. But when they do that also, even if Lord Shiva had paid obeisances to, to Daksha, not that he should not have, should never, even if he had paid obeisances to Daksha, it will be in knowledge. Just to, for social convention. He knows it just for social convention. Because he has to set an example. Here it is not that Lord Shiva, last purport became very clear, that it is not that Lord Shiva intentionally said, Oh, I am greater than him, so I should not pay obeisances. He did not mean that. By the time he observed Daksha entering the sacrificial arena, already he lost his temper, and Daksha started attacking. He did not notice Daksha entering the sacrificial arena. That is explained in the last verse. So, paying obeisances, physically, or paying obeisances in the mind, is no difference as far as the internal consciousness of the enlightened person is concerned. And whether externally he should pay obeisances, or not, whether, whatever internally he is paying respects to the soul and the super soul, and to the false ego, if for social conventions. And to the false ego for social conventions.

**Key Quote:** "He acts in each situation, in service of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** This segment explains that an enlightened person acts in service of the Supreme Lord in every situation, even when following social conventions, and discusses the spiritual master's role in teaching disciples about serving Krishna.

He acts in each situation, in service of the Supreme Lord. If out of social convention, if he has to do that, he will do it. But he knows that it is only out of social convention. The soul is identifying with the body. Therefore, you know, this is only a social convention. But for those who do not identify with their bodies, they are as good as the super soul in their quality. They are the same quality as the super soul. So, it is a great occasion to offer respects to that body, body itself. Because, the body itself is serving the soul and the super soul. So, it becomes a temple of God, an active temple of God, you can say. Everybody's body is a temple of God, because super soul is seated in their heart. But those who are acting as a servant of the super soul, engaged in devotion service of the Lord, disidentifying with their body, but utilizing their body as an instrument to serve the Lord, to such persons, you are actually paying obeisance to the super soul and the person together. And here, Prabhupada is saying that the spiritual master also sometimes pays obeisances back to the disciple. Various conceptions could, two, three different conceptions could be there in the spiritual master's mind in doing that. One is to teach the principle to the disciple that we are all servants of Krishna and we are serving the... I am your servant as a spiritual master. You are servant of Krishna as my disciple. I am servant of Krishna as a spiritual master. Both have their role to please the Supreme Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, the obeisances will be taken by the false ego and then it will become, he makes an offense because he thinks that spiritual master is respecting him."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the complexities of the spiritual master-disciple relationship, particularly regarding obeisances, and how a neophyte disciple's false ego can lead to offenses if the spiritual master returns obeisances.

But normally the disciples are not very enlightened to understand these things. So, even this transcendental message to convey, if the spiritual master pays obeisances to the disciple, then the disciple pays obeisances to the spiritual master, it can happen, but it does not have to happen, because the spiritual master also has a duty. If there is a neophyte, if he does not, if he is advanced, yes, very nice. But the principle is understood. If you, if the spiritual master pays obeisances to, back to this disciple, a neophyte disciple, now comes to social convention because he is in the platform of false ego. So, the obeisances will be taken by the false ego and then it will become, he makes an offense because he thinks that spiritual master is respecting him. I am such a great disciple, I am being respected by my spiritual master. So, immediately he makes an offense to the spiritual master. So, the spiritual master has to act in a very, in a way in which he serves his function as a guru. Therefore, he does not pay back obeisances to the false ego. And through social convention, the disciple only pays obeisances to the spiritual master and the spiritual, the false ego will become, more, false ego will decrease or the false ego will, will purify. By, false ego means what? Lauding, lauding. So, by paying obeisances, the false ego will, the lauding false ego will decrease. And at least for that moment, he will act, I am servant of somebody, I am subordinate to somebody, I have to respect somebody. So, we have to understand this principle beautifully explained by Lord Shiva in this verse.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Any respects that is received, if it ends with you, then, if it has to end with you, it has, that respect has to be eaten by your false ego, consumed, consumed by your false ego."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how a spiritual master might return obeisances to a mature disciple and emphasizes that all respect received should be offered to the Supreme Lord to avoid feeding the false ego.

Then application may be different in different situations. In particular, some situations, it is not impossible for the spiritual master to give back the obeisances to his disciple. Because he knows the spirit, my disciple is mature, he doesn't, he, he has already crossed those barriers and he understands why I am doing this. Now, in other cases, in other situations, even in, even in the case of a neophyte disciple, the spiritual master, ok, take spiritual master or even take a senior, a senior devotee or a spiritual master, in his heart he pays obeisances to the super soul. At no cost, any living entity, even spiritual master, receives somebody's respects without offering it to the Lord. Any respects that is received, if it ends with you, then, if it has to end with you, it has, that respect has to be eaten by your false ego, consumed, consumed by your false ego. So, anybody who is interested in spiritual life, the basic principle is to learn how to be the servant of the servant of the servant. If within the heart, if anybody pays respects and if a senior just receives it, thinking ok, he is, he is, he is, he ought to give me respect, then he is on the bodily platform, that means his false ego is receiving respect. If somebody is not respecting, then he gets hurt. Why I am senior devotee, why I have not been respected by the junior devotees? He gets hurt, he should never get hurt, but he should be concerned, why is that junior devotee not learning what he has to learn to respect the senior devotees? Why is he not learning? So, in that, in that aspect, he has a duty, because that is the purpose of somebody giving respect and taking respect in the heart

**Key Quote:** "It is the responsibility of the senior to take it and offer it to the super soul."
**Summary:** This segment explains that because neophyte devotees are on a social platform and cannot give respect to the super soul, it is the responsibility of senior devotees to take the respect and offer it to the super soul.

Because the neophyte devotee, neophyte devotee, he cannot, he is not, he is not understanding, he cannot give respect to the super soul and the soul, all those things, because he is in a social platform, so he pays obeisances, he gives respect, it is the responsibility of the senior to take it and offer it to the super soul. Then it becomes, then the soul is receiving that respect for, on behalf of the super soul. So to, it takes a long time of spiritual journey of practice of Bhakti Yoga, to see every living entity as this, you know, combined, inseparable combination of soul and super soul. It takes time. We have to come out of our bodily concept, we have to take everybody out of their bodily concept in our mind. They may be in bodily concept, but we should take everybody out of the bodily concept. We should not see others as their bodies. So if the principle is understood, basically what is this principle? In one line, these paying obeisances, as for a spiritualist are concerned, it is not for false ego. At the same time, we are in this material world. So, these conventions are also required. If at all by, we follow the conventions, it is sake of convention only. There also we only, we follow the convention, but actually in our heart, we are paying obeisances, we are giving respect to the super soul. Because Lord is everywhere, I can give respect anywhere. No bar. So enlightened person does not give respect to false egos. The person with false ego may be thinking out of, he does not know that out of convention, a person is paying obeisances to him. An enlightened person is paying obeisances to him.

### social convention, super soul, soul, etiquette

**Key Quote:** "Enlightened people do it for the super soul."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how enlightened people offer respect to the super soul, even when following social conventions, and that a pure, enlightened soul is not different from the super soul.

Maybe just because he is father-in-law or whatever it is. He may not understand. He will take, okay for my false ego is given. But he is enlightened person, even if it is father-in-law, he is giving it to the super soul. All this bodily identification, father-in-law, son-in-law, all those things are purely on the social convention. Enlightened people do it for the super soul. Super soul, soul, a pure soul, a pure enlightened soul is not different from the super soul. So it is for the combination. Because question may ask, so you do not respect the soul at all? Only it is for the super soul we pay obeisances? No. If the soul is spiritual, if the soul is enlightened, soul has attained the quality of the super soul, then when you are paying obeisances to the super soul, you are already paying obeisances. You are even giving respects to the soul also. Just like somebody can say, I pay obeisances to Prabhupada. Am I paying respect to Prabhupada or only the super soul? Prabhupada. Hmm? You are paying respects to both. You are paying respects to both. Because he is of the same, he is awakened and he is of the same quality as the super soul. His identity that manifests in this material world is pure identity. There is no false ego. His real ego is manifesting. So if his real ego is there, real superego is super soul. Real ego is also servant of Krishna. So I am actually paying my obeisances to his real ego and the superego, which is supreme ego, which is the supreme lord. It is also as a matter of etiquette.

So there are etiquettes which are Vaishnava etiquette. There are social etiquettes. And within the Vaishnava community, there is Vaishnava social etiquette. Not everybody, everybody is enlightened. To have only etiquette at the Paramarthic level. As I explained the neophyte, the different stages of enlightenment of the devotee, so they need. In fact, even the normal social conventions of inter-human relationship, as per our Sanatana Dharma, the culture is set as a pre-runner to proper, pre-runner to inter-flow of respect as per proper

transcendental knowledge. So that everybody understands that, you know, develops humility. If somebody offers respect, he has to offer respect to, son has to offer respect to the father, and his son will offer respect to him. Just see, it's not that, you know, somebody even in social convention, he is only receiving respect. He has to give respect also. In social convention, because it is based on material qualifications, and this and that, and all those karma, and all those things. But the principle is still practiced, so that the principle of respect is there in our Dharma, which is not there in the western civilization. Within the family system itself, there is culture, this value is cultured. You take the blessings of the parents, in India it's so common, take blessings of parents before going for examination. That may not be there now, at least nowadays we used to do. These they don't, they may not be there also. In good cultured family, yes, it will be there. Some cultured families, so much so that, as soon as they get up in the morning, first time they see father and mother, they have to pay obeisance, they touch their feet. You know, so much significance is there, in this kind of practices.

**Summary:** This segment answers a question about the extra level of respect given to a devotee, explaining that it is due to the greater manifestation and awakening of the soul in a devotee.

I have two questions for you. The first question is, you told that, body is a temple of Lord. So, Lord and Jeeva is present, both in a karmi's body and also devotee's body. So now, what is the extra level of respect, so I should respect everyone, what is the extra respect which I should give to a devotee? So my understanding is, because with the thinking and feeling, they engage this body also in the service of Lord. So that is the extra respect I give to the devotee, because a devotee is also not a body, he is a soul and the super soul is also with him. Right. What is, in a devotee, more of his soul is manifest. Manifest means, more of it is awakened. If there is awakened, if there is awakening, then there is, for instance, a person is sleeping. So you, you pay obeisance to him. What is, you, he is sleeping, no, might as well don't pay. So if somebody is little awake, okay, there is exchange of respect. So it, to the degree to which the soul is awakened, the soul will receive the, spiritually, the degree to which he is awakened and the degree to which there is a combination. There is a false ego most of the time and there is, sometimes there is manifestation of, of one's real ego. Or it's a mixture, just like you wake up from the dream. Right. You are in a mixed state. Your half mind is in the dream, half mind, half mind is in the reality. So it takes some time for you to come out of the dream world and go into the reality.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the oscillating state of consciousness between sleeping and wakeful states, and how doing service with false ego or for social recognition can disturb devotional service.

So we are all like that. We are all half awake, quarter awake, some percentage we are awake. We are not fully awake. So because we are not fully awake, when half awake, suddenly some sense gratification comes, we become fully sleepy and full false ego takes over. So we are oscillating, our state of consciousness is oscillating between sleeping state and wakeful state. When you are in good association, when you are fired up, when you do your good chanting and all these things, then when you associate with the holy name, nice kirtan and all those things, after that, you actually, you are spiritually more awake. And when you are spiritually more awake, we will be able to do our service free from false ego. When we do our service with false ego, then it has all complications are there. So many disturbances even in our devotional service comes because of doing service with false ego or doing service for social rasa, social recognition, criterion for or motivation for service is not independent motivation between you, your thoughts, authorities, Prabhupada and Krishna. It is not that you have your own motivation of what the devotees will think, what the society will think, how much result I brought, how much result I did not bring. Criterion, we become servant of the society and not servant of Prabhupada and Krishna. When you become servant of the society, then when you become depressed, then you get unnecessarily stress in your service, then there is, it affects one's spiritual life.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes doing service for the satisfaction of Prabhupada and Krishna, not being attached to results, and understanding that the work is your job, but the result is Krishna's domain, referencing Bhagavad Gita.

If one is doing service for the satisfaction of Prabhupada and Krishna directly, that's my criterion, then, even if results don't come, then Krishna says, you are spiritually situated, you see it is at, Krishna says, don't be attached to results. You work in a Krishna conscious way, Madashraya, depend upon me, take shelter of me and work, don't independently work. Not that I independently work and go and give something. Devotion service is never independent work. Devotion service is, just like taking something, just like Ganges water you take and pour back into the Ganges. Devotion, nature of devotion service is that, not that somewhere you bring water which belongs to somebody and you give it to Krishna. Everything, my body belongs to him, but I am taking it and I am offering it. So depending on him, where I will get water, you depend upon him. Results depend upon him and then serve Krishna. Krishna wants that love of offering. Krishna wants, Bhavagrahi Janardana, that is what he wants. Result, he is the one who is doing, he is the one who is giving. The service, the work that leads to the result is your job. The result is his job. That is the first thing that Krishna teaches

**Summary:** This segment discusses how to approach work with pressure but without obsession over results, emphasizing that the Supersoul is the awarder of all results.

in Bhagavad Gita. How to work, the art of work. Take pressures, take stress. In the work itself of the day, the day's work, you take pressure. What I have to do, what I have to do. Don't give a little space for Maya to come. Don't sit the whole day and think, you know, get obsessed with the result. Result will come or not. Result will come or not. And none of your business will come or not will be decided by Krishna. That's what he is telling, Krishna is telling in the Bhagavad Gita. Super soul is the awarder of all results. So for devotees also, he is the awarder of. That's his domain. Result is his domain. I have to intellectually think of the result, not emotionally, getting it, not getting it. You have to intellectually think about the result because you will, it will give you direction how to do work. So we do think about the result of the activity, but we do not emotionalize the results, outcome of the results. We want results, we will be happy if we can offer to Krishna. But the outcome, you don't emotionalize. I should succeed. If I succeed, if I don't succeed, it is a failure of devotional service. If you have sincerely put your work towards the result, then it is already success for devotee, devotional service. That is, you can be succeed only, you can succeed only in your domain. How you can succeed in somebody else's domain? Results are always in the domain of the Supersoul.

**Summary:** This segment discusses that devotees have desires for Krishna, and the questioner asks if it is correct to see Prabhupada as a manifestation of Paramatma, rather than seeing the duality of Jeevatma and Paramatma.

For every living entity, Karmi, everybody, he is a sanctioner of the desires. Devotees have desires for Krishna, that is the only difference. But desires for Krishna also, Krishna only has to satisfy in this material world, it is like that. Because he is the Parameshwara. Any other question? The second question is, you told that Prabhupada has also Jeevatma and Paramatma. So we have to offer respect to both. So now, the question is, I am seeing him as a manifestation of Paramatma. Tatva wise, okay, it is Jeevatma and Paramatma. But because all the knowledge, what all experience he has given about Krishna, or devotional service, is actually coming from him. So I am seeing him as directly the instructions or means from Supersoul. So is that attitude correct? Directly, last line? No, means whatever, I am seeing, I am not seeing that duality in Prabhupada, like Jeevatma, Prabhupada is a Jeeva, or I am just seeing him as a, okay, Supersoul is acting through him completely.

**Summary:** This segment answers the question about seeing Prabhupada as a manifestation of Paramatma, explaining that while Prabhupada is a Jeevatma, he is a transparent via media for the Supersoul, and we should give him devotional credit for his service and appreciate his qualities.

So is that attitude right? Tatva wise, there is Jeevatma and Paramatma. That is true. But I am asking, that I am, whatever experience… Yeah, but the Jeevatma has got, you have to see Jeevatma with his devotion, with his spirit, to serve the Supersoul. So you are getting that instruction from the Supersoul. He is a transparent via media. So you have to give him devotional credit for his transparent via media. You have to give devotional credit for his service to the Supreme Lord. And therefore, he is serving us. So where do we get such souls who will be transparent and will act as a medium? Because I cannot receive instruction from the Supersoul, who, by my spiritual Master's mercy, I get directed in my service. Asya Prasadat, Bhagavata Prasadat, so by his mercy I am able to get direction of the Supersoul who is in my heart. So therefore, we have to see the truth is to be seen, no? It is not simply, you know, transparent via media means it's, it's a language used, but it's a personal transparent via media. It's not an impersonal transparent via media like a glass. It's a, it's a personal via media, personal via media means only his wishes, it goes to him and he's the soul enjoyer. Supersoul is a soul enjoyer. But that spiritual Master is a person. So therefore, we start appreciating the qualities of that person, qualities of Supersoul. Then we become qualities of the spiritual Masters. Then we become attached to the spiritual Master. So all these things are very much part of the devotee's life. He has to become attached to the spiritual Master, grateful to the spiritual Master, all these things.

**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa explains how food offered to the Lord becomes sanctified and spiritualized, having a transcendental effect.

We distribute food that is sanctified. It's not about even material purity; when it becomes sanctified by offering to the Lord, with gratitude to the Lord for providing this for existence, that makes it super sanctified, spiritually sanctified. It has got a very curative, healing, transcendental effect for the good of the person who honors sanctified food, and that is what we are distributing. And how is it sanctified? The Lord sanctifies it transcendentally. He sees the—the Lord eats our—it's a mystical process. Every lot is not offered; the Lord knows thousands of people are coming every day. Mass distribution of prasadam means, you know, it's a different kind of, you know, leela of the Lord, you see. Just like shaktivesha nama, Lord shakti enters in it. Similarly, food, when it is offered to the Lord, it is spiritualized food; it is matter.

## Importance of Attitude of Servitude in Spiritual Life | Sri Madhu Pandit Dasa | SB 3.22.6

**Key Quote:** "Unless one is fortunate enough to have the dust of the lotus feet of a mahatma on one's head, there is no possibility of perfection in spiritual life."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of the parampara system and the grace of a spiritual master in achieving spiritual perfection, highlighting that rituals alone are insufficient without the blessings of a great soul.

Translation on purpose by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. Translation: It is my good fortune that I have been able to see you, for you cannot easily be seen by persons who have not subdued the mind or controlled the senses. I am all the more fortunate to have touched my head to the blessed dust of your feet. Purport by Srila Prabhupada: The perfection of transcendental life can be achieved simply by touching the holy dust of the feet of a holy man. In the Bhagavatam it is said, mahat pada rajo 'bhishekam, which means to be blessed by the holy dust of the lotus feet of a mahat, or great devotee. As stated in Bhagavad Gita, mahatmanas tu, those who are great souls are under the spell of spiritual energy, and their symptom is that they fully engage in Krishna consciousness for the service of the Lord. Therefore, they are called mahatmas. Unless one is fortunate enough to have the dust of the lotus feet of a mahatma on one's head, there is no possibility of perfection in spiritual life. The parampara system of disciplic succession is very important as a means of spiritual success. One becomes a mahat by the grace of his mahat spiritual master. If one takes shelter of the lotus feet of a great soul, there is every possibility of one's also becoming a great soul. When Maharaj Rahugana asked Jadabharata about his wonderful achievements of spiritual success, he replied to the king that spiritual success is not possible simply by following the rituals of religion or simply by converting oneself into a sanyasi or offering sacrifices as recommended in the scriptures. These methods are undoubtedly helpful for spiritual realization, but the real effect is brought about by the grace of a mahatma. By the grace of a mahatma, in Vishvanatha Chakravarti Thakura's eight stanzas of prayers to the spiritual master, it is clearly stated that simply by satisfying the spiritual master, one can achieve the supreme success in life, and in spite of executing all ritualistic performances, if one cannot satisfy the spiritual master, one has no access to spiritual perfection. Here the word akritatmanam is very significant. Atma means body, soul, or mind, and akritatma means the common man who cannot control the senses or the mind. Because the common man is unable to control the senses and the mind, it is his duty to seek the shelter of a great soul or a great devotee of the Lord and just try to please him. That will make his life perfect. A common man cannot rise to the topmost stage of spiritual realization simply by following the rituals and religious principles. He has to take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and work under his direction faithfully and sincerely, then he becomes perfect without a doubt.

**Key Quote:** "The dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee is highly potent for making advancement in spiritual life."
**Summary:** This segment discusses various ways to receive mercy, including prasadam, darshan of deities, and the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee, emphasizing that these are not merely metaphorical but real and potent.

They are in the place of pilgrimages. People go to the place of pilgrimage, then they take their blessings. This is the culture, sanatana dharma culture. So here we see that Manu is praising the value of contacting the dust of a great personality. You have been released, released for hot, for top, told, om, and there are unlimited ways in which this mercy is actually transmitted, and we can list so many things which for our senses like prasadam. By contacting the prasadam, we get mercy with our tongue. By having darshana of the deities, we get mercy. By hearing, by hearing, we get mercy. By worshiping, we get mercy. By taking, we get mercy. One more item is here which is highly potent for making advancement in spiritual life. What is that? The dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee. This is not metaphorical; it is actually the real dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee. If one is able to place the dust on his head, then one gets special mercy. These are all ways of receiving the mercy which are not phenomenally calculatable through some material phenomena. What is the value of a dust? Take the dust of the lotus feet of Prabhupada. Here is deity, whole day deity is here. Some dust will collect. Water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, and us upyogation to bahut karenge.

**Key Quote:** "Just by reading you don't get transcendental knowledge; when you read, Prabhupada should act on you through these pages, then you get transcendental mercy."
**Summary:** This segment explains that spiritual relationships and transcendental knowledge are not transactional, and that true understanding and realization come through the personal mercy of a pure devotee, like Srila Prabhupada, not just through mechanical reading or rituals.

So this is the meaning of mercy. Our mind is always used to transactional things. That means, you know, I pay for it, I get it. Our relationship, spiritual relationship with the deity, relationship with the holy name, our relationship with the spiritual master, our relationship with Vaishnavas, we cannot think in terms of a transaction. What do you get from Srila Prabhupada? No, I get transcendental knowledge. How do you get transcendental knowledge? Because books are there, I read, I get transcendental knowledge. Just by reading, you don't get transcendental knowledge. When you read, Prabhupada should act on you through these pages, then you get transcendental mercy, then you get mercy, then you get understanding, then you get realization. So one should understand that reading Prabhupada's books or anything, contacting any of the forms of mercy of the Lord is not something that can be mechanically, ritualistically achieved. That Prabhupada explains it, just by ritual one cannot, you know, get it done by the Lord. It is bhakti. Even if one chants 16 rounds, it may help, Prabhupada is saying it may help, but he will have no access to spiritual perfection. Access to spiritual perfection means you have to get the personal mercy of a pure devotee, not general mercy. General mercy is available. Prabhupada's books are available everywhere, general mercy. Personal mercy means yes, Prabhupada gets linked to you when you get initiated, he links to you and he is your personal spiritual master. He is not only teaching you, there are so many other things he is doing to you. He is monitoring to you. He and Chaitya Guru together is monitoring to you, monitoring your growth, spiritual growth.

**Key Quote:** "Whatever I have is a kripa of my spiritual master; I have not earned it."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that spiritual progress is primarily due to the mercy of the spiritual master, obtained through service and pleasing him, which can purify one and lead to control of the senses and mind, even if one is initially unable to do so.

Therefore, the Vaishnavas always say that I am made up of the mercy of my spiritual master. Whatever I have is a kripa of my spiritual master. If I have some standing, if I have some detachment, it is given by my spiritual master. I have not earned it. He believes it. I have not earned it. Why? Because he understands that actually by any bodily action, by tongue, moving your tongue sixteen rounds and all, you cannot get bhakti. You can get bhakti when you move sixteen rounds. It will give you some foundation, but ultimately you have to get the personal mercy of the spiritual master which comes by, here Prabhupada is giving that secret here, by serving a bona fide spiritual master, by serving him one gets that. Because the common man is unable to control the spiritual life, and the mind, it is his duty to seek shelter of a great soul or a great devotee of the Lord and just try to please him. Just see, do service to him and try to please him, then even if you cannot control your senses and mind, still by his mercy you will purify. Very soon you will be able to control your senses.

**Key Quote:** "The real perfection or the result of all that comes only by the personal mercy of the spiritual master."
**Summary:** This segment highlights that while secondary instructions and exercises are helpful, the real perfection comes from the personal mercy of the spiritual master, and that one's attitude and determination to serve are key to attracting that mercy, as illustrated by the story of the sparrow.

So therefore one should understand that the easiest, though we may do all the exercises that we are trying to do, so many secondary instructions are there, control this, shamas, damas, tapas, all these things are there. We are trying to follow all those things. While following those things, one should understand that the result of the real perfection or the result of all that comes only by the personal mercy of the spiritual master, and this has to be practiced by the devotee because you don't see with your eyes. It is a matter of faith. From this yasya prasadat bhagavata prasadat, everyday we are singing, but we cannot see how it is happening. When you see something, somebody gives you something, you know, gross in your hand, you say thank you because you see he has given, but we have to learn how to transcendentally see this through the descending process that everyday we have to say thank you, thank you, thank you. Every moment we have to go on saying thank you, thank you, thank you to Srila Prabhupada, to Guru and Krishna. Continuously they are giving. So what is the spiritual process of spiritual advancement, spiritual progress in our Sampradaya? It is always beg for the mercy of the devotees, beg for the mercy of the Vaishnavas. Then one may think what is my role? Shouldn't I do anything? No, one should do, but one should understand that what one does is simply to show our attitude to the spiritual master that I am serious about it, I want your mercy, I am serious about following your instruction. Just like the story in Bhagavad Gita, Prabhupada explains about the sparrow trying to recover her eggs from the ocean. She was so determined that she was trying to take out drop by drop water through her beaks and trying to empty the ocean, but finally her, obviously, you know, by material calculation, can a sparrow empty the ocean? Not possible. Her goal was what? To get the eggs back, but then she got mercy of Garuda. She got the egg back. Why was Garuda attracted? Because of her determination. In the same way, to attract the mercy of the Lord, it is not the quantum of skill, the quantum of what you have given and all these things is not what the attitude, if the attitude to attract the mercy of the Lord is there.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the balance between effort and mercy, emphasizing that while effort (sadhana) is essential, the result is ultimately due to the mercy of the guru, and one should not take away the guru's credit for one's advancement.

What you need, guru will give. Whatever you need for his service, whatever you need for your advancement, the guru will bestow upon us. So this is a process by which, you know, we need to balance effort and mercy. What is the value that you give to your effort, your sadhana, this thing, effort, and in your mind what is the value as far as doing is concerned, your effort? You have to do, but as far as result is concerned, one should not think my effort was a very big factor. As far as doing is concerned, yes, I have to do. I cannot spare anything. I have to do. As far as result is concerned, oh, I chanted so many years very nicely, now I have advanced. You can say that I have chanted nicely so long for by Prabhupada's mercy my chanting has become fruitful. I got mercy. You can say that. You cannot take away Prabhupada. You cannot take away guru's mercy.

**Key Quote:** "When you submissively hear, then the feelings also you get, and the feelings go, the transformation that happens for a person is faster."
**Summary:** This segment explains the difference between intellectual and submissive hearing, highlighting that submissive hearing allows one to grasp the feelings of the speaker, leading to faster transformation, and that a rational mind can be a barrier to receiving mercy.

Just like let us say we hear Srimad Bhagavatam class. It is said that one has to submissively hear. You can submissively hear, you can intellectually hear also. When you intellectually hear, you will only get the ideas. When you submissively hear, you will get the feelings of the speaker. When somebody speaks, he speaks what? Ideas, feelings, realization, right? He speaks. You submissively hear, then the feelings also you get, and the feelings go. The transformation that happens for a person is faster when you can get the feelings of, let us say, Prabhupada's feelings. If you put a filter of only intellectual thing, let us say Prabhupada lecture you are hearing, ok, ok, philosophical, philosophical, all these things intellectually you are adjusting, but Prabhupada says rascal, then you know it is nothing philosophical. It is not a philosophical idea at all. You get the feeling why Prabhupada is calling this fellow rascal. So that submissiveness is, if you have submissiveness, how will you have submissiveness? Only when there is anticipation you will have submissiveness, otherwise, oh, you would be submissive. Oh, I am expecting something, anticipating. So anticipating mercy of deity, you go before the deity, you have to have anticipation. It does not mean specific prayers, but there is mercy coming. Chanting Hare Krishna, you have to have anticipation of mercy, being in the presence of a spiritual master, you should get anticipate. So there has to be preparedness for receiving this mercy also, and the rational mind is the biggest enemy.

The rational mind, sometimes devotees get stuck in this rational thing for whole life. Everything they intellectualize. They sit in the class, they intellectualize. They go before the deity, they intellectualize. They take association, they intellectualize. You want to make rapid progress, rapid, then you have to understand the vibration of every situation, and then right from descending process that mercy will come and quick advancement will make. A common man cannot rise to the top most stage of spiritual perfection simply by following the rituals and religious principles.

**Summary:** This segment addresses the question of how much rationality should be applied in spiritual life, explaining that while rationality can be used to glorify and appreciate, over-rationalizing and speculating can hinder understanding of mercy.

You see, rational, when you are, the good question everywhere, rationality is there. The issue is about being over rational. Just like you say bhakti and vedanta. Vedanta is rational path. Bhakti is not the rational path. It is the mercy path. So in order to glorify, in order to appreciate, in order to, one uses rationality even in bhakti. When rationality is not used in the spiritual life, then when rationality is used to understand the mercy, then it becomes speculation.

**Key Quote:** "Bhakti never stands without knowledge; there is knowledge always."
**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on rationality, emphasizing that bhakti is founded on knowledge of truth, and that one should not over-endeavor intellectually but rather focus on serving and appreciating the mercy of Prabhupada.

One truth you receive, you don't understand philosophically, you don't understand. Now if you go deep, deep, deep, going on and on and on, speculating too many things, then you are over rational. You need to understand that the rational understanding at the right time, I have to do more service. We can all rationally analyze and somehow to control the senses and all these things rationally analyze. That's what the mayavadhis, impersonalists do. They rationally they analyze what is self concept and this and that all those things. And as devotees, when the right time comes, he comes out of the bodily concept. Now that's what it said, when you have bhakti, you have knowledge also. Bhakti never stands without knowledge. There is knowledge always. There is a very foundation is knowledge. Bhakti is not foundation is not ignorance is knowledge. Knowledge of truth, tattva is always there as a foundation. So how much we should apply our intelligence? Don't over endeavor. If that intelligence is not coming to you now, serve, continue serving, you will understand. So that is, that is the extent to which you should exercise your, put all your efforts in serving, put your efforts in appreciating the mercy of Prabhupada, all these things.

**Summary:** This segment addresses how to be sure that one is putting in their all effort, explaining that one should strive to put in their best effort but remain humble, acknowledging that Krishna and Prabhupada's mercy are ultimately responsible for any success.

You said Prabhu that we should put our all effort and anticipate. How should I be sure that the effort which I am putting in my devotional service is my all effort or we may be sometime in the miser condition also that I may think that I am putting all my effort but I may not be putting. You should put all your efforts but not think that you have put all your efforts. While putting the efforts you should think I should put best of my efforts but should not think that actually whether I put the best or not I do not know maybe I withheld so many things inside. You should not say I put my best efforts. You say philosophy in life is to put best efforts but whether I really put the best efforts I do not know. So even if you know something fails you will say that I have not put best effort. If he succeeds he will also say I have not put best efforts. Whatever was lacking Krishna and Prabhupada gave and therefore I did it.

**Key Quote:** "Thus Brahmanical culture and crow protection are the basic principles for human civilization."
**Summary:** The speaker reads and explains a verse and purport emphasizing the roles of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas in protecting society and each other, highlighting the importance of Brahmanical culture.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 22, Verse 3: TATRANAYA SHRI CHACCASMAN TATRANAYA SHRI CHACCASMAN DOHA SAHASRAT SAHASRAPAD DOHA SAHASRAT SAHASRAPAD RIDAYAM TASHYAHI BRAMMA RIDAYAM TASHYAHI BRAMMA SATRAM ANRAM PRACHAT SATE SATRAM ANRAM PRACHAT SATE. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "For the protection of the Brahmanas, the thousand-leaded Supreme Being created us, the Satryas, from His thousand arms. Hence the Brahmanas are said to be His heart and the Satryas, His arms." Purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "Satryas are specifically meant to maintain the Brahmanas because if the Brahmanas are protected and the head of civilization is protected, Brahmanas are supposed to be protected. Brahmanas are supposed to be the head of the social body. If the head is clear and has not gone mad, then everything is in proper position. The Lord is described thus, Namo Brahmania Devaya, Go Brahmana Hitayacha. The purport of this prayer is that the Lord specifically protects the Brahmanas and the cows, and then He protects all other members of society. It is His will that universal welfare work depends on the protection of cows and Brahmanas. Thus Brahmanical culture and cow protection are the basic principles for human civilization. Satryas are especially meant to protect the Brahmanas, as is the supreme will of the Lord. Go Brahmana Hitayacha. As the Supreme Will of the Lord, Go Brahmana Hitayacha. As the Supreme Will of the Lord, Go Brahmana Hitayacha. Because within the body, the heart is a very important part, so the brahmanas are also the important element in human society. The satryas are more like the whole body. Even though the whole body is bigger than the heart, the heart is more important."

### Lord as Cause and Effect, Simultaneous Oneness and Difference, Kardama Muni, Manu

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "See, the Lord is simultaneously one and different from everything in His creation."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of the Lord being both the cause and effect, simultaneously one with and different from His creation, using the example of Manu appearing before Kardama Muni.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Parvat. This is being explained by Manu to Kardama Muni, starting with saying that, O Kardama Muni, you are a brahmana, and Brahma created you from his face, and you are full of austerity, knowledge, mystic power, and averse to sense gratification. And then for protection of brahmanas like you, the Lord created kshatriyas, who are like him, like Manu, kshatriyas, and the body of a kshatriya, the body of a brahmana, and the lord, through his thousand-legged Supreme Being, created us, the kshatriyas, from his thousand arms. And this way, the brahamanas and kshatriyas protect each other as well as themselves. And the lord who is both the cause and the effect protects them through each other. So, how this is slowly becoming obvious is because there is a time interval here where these two events are lived here. That is not necessary. They are not necessary. They don't matter. We are like water. This entire material world function with the Lord as the cause and effect is finely explained here, who is both the cause and effect and is yet immutable, protects them through each other.

### Lord's Energies, Vishnu Expansions, Super Soul, Karma, Free Will

**Key Quote:** "The Lord's role in this material world as a super soul, because ultimately everything is Lord's Leela, is giving an opportunity for the living entities in this material world to express their freedom."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Lord's various energies and expansions, including the Super Soul, and emphasizes that the Lord's role in the material world is to provide living entities with the opportunity to exercise their free will.

See, the Lord is simultaneously one and different from everything in His creation. So when, just like when Manu appeared before Kardamuni, the way Kardamuni looked at him, the perspective with which he looked at him, he was addressing him as a Lord because he saw that, because he understood that a perfect Kshatriya is representing the Lord, and he is a Lord in one sense. So everybody, ultimately everything in existence is the Lord through His energies. We are one kind of energies, expansion of the Lord. Material energy is another kind of energy. So, so many different energies are, the Lord has got unlimited, vividaya shakti, unlimited varieties of shaktis are there. It belongs to the Lord and ultimately all the shaktis are functioning for the pleasure of one single personality, Krishna, Adipurusha and His expansions, different Vishnus. So in the material world, a particular Vishnu as Shirodakshaya Vishnu, Garbhodakshaya Vishnu, Karnodakshaya Vishnu, Garbhodakshaya Vishnu and Shirodakshaya Vishnu directly, more directly, involved with every activities in this material world, starting from. But that activity of the Lord as the super soul is in creating this material world, giving shape to this material world, facilitating all the secondary creation of Brahma. So He is involved in that sense. But in which way He is not involved? At a macro level, the super soul is involved. And at the individual level, with respect to people's karma, it is clearly explained that the super soul does not interfere. It is left to the system. His energies, his guna, kala, karma is actually churning this material world, each person's life and it does not interfere there. The Lord's role in this material world as a super soul, because ultimately everything is Lord's Leela, is giving an opportunity for the living entities in this material world to express their freedom. The marginal energy of the Lord to express our freedom, either way.

### Kshetra and Kshetrajna, Super Soul, Universal Welfare, Material Energy

**Key Quote:** "So, in the material world, if you want anything to happen, it has to be through the material energy only."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Kshetra and Kshetrajna, the connection of the Lord to every heart through the Super Soul, and the necessity of using material energy to accomplish anything in the material world.

So this is a field, Kshetra, where the Kshetrajna, the living entities are given this opportunity. And in this game, the Lord Himself as the supreme proprietor of all the bodies, is Sarvasachaham Rudhisannivishta. So how the Lord is connected to every heart. The Lord is connected to every heart in this material world. That is through the form of the super soul, Shirodaksha Vishnu. And even a more deeper understanding of the super soul, is given here. Just like the sun is on the head of different people and each person feels relationship with the sun above his head. In the same way, the super soul is never divided. I have a super soul for myself, for you and all those things. There is no difference. Though the Lord is personally witnessing and sanctioning all the activities of the individual living entity, the Lord is undivided. In this example is given of the sun over different people's head. Sun which is millions of miles away. Similarly, Shirodaksha Vishnu, He is the supreme proprietor of everything in this material world. He is the supreme Param Eeshwara of everything in this material world. And that Param Eeshwara Leela is performed by the Lord with respect to living entities, both devotees and demons. The two kinds of living entities. So, living entities between themselves, like the Brahmanas are given certain qualities, Kshatriyas are given certain qualities, the Kshatriya body is given certain qualities, the Brahmana body is given certain qualities. It is all given by the Lord. And between themselves, they protect each other. So, in the material world, if you want anything to happen, it has to be through the material energy only. Just like you want to clean your face, you have to take your material hand and clean your material face. Is it not? So, in the same way, everything that has to happen in this material world, it is designed in such a way,

### Reconfiguring Matter, Intelligence, Atheism, Godless Atmosphere

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Activity in this material world means nothing but reorganizing matter."
**Summary:** The speaker defines activity in the material world as reorganizing matter using intelligence, and explains why atheists may not perceive God's presence due to the designed godless atmosphere.

it has to happen through the material energy. The metal energy itself has to reconfigure. For instance, we have to build this temple, we have to bring cement, so many things from different places, brick and everything. These things are all just reconfigured here, but they were already existing. So, this reconfiguration is what is called as work in this material world. Reconfiguration for different objectives. What is our objective? We want to create a visual shelter for the Lord, a visual beautiful place like this. This is our purpose. And then we reorganize everything. So, activity in this material world means nothing but reorganizing matter. And we are... The key element for reorganizing matter is buddhi, intelligence. And Prabhupada says that the super soul is realized in this material world as intelligence form. The all-pervading intelligence, everywhere that intelligence is there. Of course, that intelligence is given according to one's karma. There is a... Each individual body has got certain intelligence which is deposited. Certain intelligence, certain type of intelligence, brahmana intelligence, kshatriya intelligence, shudra intelligence, is all deposited in the sharira, the body of the living entity. And then that works. And that's how the society is running. That is the reason why atheists are not able to locate the factor of God. Where is God? You don't need God at all. Everything is running. I don't see God's factor at all. One human being is protecting another human being. Why do you say God protected? One set of human beings are feeding the other set of human beings. The farmers are working. They are producing food. So you are getting food. Why are you thanking God? Where is God in the picture? Why is it so? It is so because it is designed like that. God wants to create an atmosphere where you can forget Him. This material world is meant for that. So it is working very perfectly. Those who don't want to see God will never see God. Those who don't want to see God will be thoroughly convinced there is no God.

### Paramatma, Chaitya Guru, Spiritual Journey, Free Will

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Lord's feeling towards the material world is of high respect for our free will."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of the Paramatma as the Chaitya Guru, guiding all living entities on their spiritual journey with respect for their free will.

Because whatever the Lord does, He will do it perfectly. He wanted to create a godless atmosphere. He has created it. And in the midst of it, now come to the what role the Paramatma, the Lord plays with respect to those who want to serve Him. Those who want to serve Him, the Lord acts as the Chaitya Guru for the living entity. Not only for Vaishnavas, for everybody. He is a Chaitya Guru for everyone. He is a teacher for everyone. He sits in the heart of every living entity. Whatever class he may be in, may be in 1st standard, 2nd standard, 3rd standard, Vaishnavism may be graduation level. Karmi may be 2nd standard, 3rd standard. He is also on a spiritual journey. Just like in graduation, our Vaishnava life also, we also go up and we come down, right? We rise our consciousness sometimes up, then we fall down also. Our test we fail, test we pass. We keep going up. Up and down. Same way, every living entity is going up and down. Going on and like this. This journey is facilitated by the Supersoul with utmost respect for the living entity's freedom. This is the key thing. What is the Lord's feeling towards the material world? Lord's feeling towards the material world is of high respect for our free will. Not respect for how we use our free will. But it is respect for our free will. Respect for free will is different from respect for how we use the free will. If somebody uses the free will properly, then your respect for his use of free will. Isn't it? Because why he respects the Lord's respect? Because that is what Jeeva's inherent quality is given to him. The Lord has expanded as Jeeva. Vibhinnamsa. We are Lord only. We are Krishna only. We are Krishna's energy. One in quality with him. So he wants it like that. Lord, he decides what to create, why to create, he knows. That way the living entities are having this freedom and this freedom is respected. This is the understanding of how the living entities are all free in this material world. Those who want to turn towards him at whatever stage may be, the Lord is seated inside and he guides the living entity.

**Key Quote:** "Nothing has happened by chance. The Paramatma is seated in the heart and he is guiding the living entity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the Lord guides living entities indirectly through material experiences and directly through a spiritual master, emphasizing the Paramatma's patience and constant guidance.

At a particular stage of maturity the guiding may guide the living entity and they take the form of taking on to a bona fide spiritual master at a particular stage. Before that it may be teaching in so many ways through Adhyatmik, Adhibhautik, Adhidaivik, Kleshas. Constantly it is all incorporated in this material world. Indirect teaching. Metallurgy itself teaches a living entity indirectly. And as we progress, we surrender to a spiritual master, he starts teaching directly. Divya Gyan Hridaya Prakashit. So the principle of teaching, the principle of guiding the living entity is operating always in this material world. It's an amazing thing. It's an amazing thing. The existence of that operating principle of elevating the living entity is an amazing realization that especially a devotee can have. If you take your life from the day you touch Prabhupada's book, the day you came across Vaishnava and today where you are. Nothing has happened by chance. The Paramatma is seated in the heart and he is guiding the living entity. The Lord is very patient.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how the Paramatma remembers everything about the living entity and guides them step-by-step in spiritual life, highlighting the continuous operation of spiritual intelligence or Guru Tattva.

And he remembers everything. We remember what's in our this life. He remembers all our previous lives. He remembers all our anarthas. He remembers all our tendencies. Everything he remembers. And the living entity is and if you see our life as devotees how gradually he gives he teaches A first then B first then C first then D then making sentences then writing an essay just like you learn a language from elements to in the same way from ABC of spiritual life you cannot see one cannot be you cannot tell somebody to understand algebra before understanding arithmetic. Is it not? So arithmetic has to be taught. So some teacher has to have take some guidance, take some intelligence what is my student's level and accordingly he will give. Isn't it? Similarly the Paramatma knows exactly where we stand in our learning of the absolute truth the knowledge, pure knowledge, bhakti everything and step by step he is making us advance in Krishna consciousness. That is why after five years or ten years in Krishna consciousness moment you are a different person from what you were when you entered. You are a person with knowledge. You are a person with some detachment. You are a person with certain perspective of this material world. Who is doing this? It is amazing thing. It is continuously that intelligence principle spiritual intelligence principle is operating on us and we know that it is we may say intelligence principle and all that actually that principle is called Guru Tatva the principle of Guru the principle of Guru is operating one principle of Guru is operating everywhere it is represented by different pure devotees of the Lord and this is very important that every devotee reflects his life now and then how did I understand this? How did I understand this? I never understood this five years back. Now I understood this. We are actually taking for granted so many things Lord is revealing within the heart. We are taking for granted. Some source has to be there and somebody has to be giving it. Mata smritir jnanam apohanam ca Krishna is doing that.

**Key Quote:** "For those who want to go back to Godhead, the Lord personally protects."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while the Lord generally doesn't interfere with individual karma, He intervenes to protect those who want to return to Godhead, offering liberation from sin.

So we are very lovingly taken care of by the Lord those who want journey back to God He is lovingly taken care of So even though it is said here that they protect themselves through each other the there is a bigger principle operating that for those who want to go back to Godhead the Lord personally protects like I will relieve you from all papa Papa cannot be relieved easily Papa can be relieved only by suffering in the material world. So here Lord puts His finger in and He says sarva papebhyo mokshesh sami ma su chaha He puts, He intervenes and He clears the papa, the reaction of papa for the living entity. So first preliminary understanding is that the Lord does not interfere each person's life according to guna kala karma it goes on. And the next level of understanding is that no, it is not just that He is not only upadrishta and anumantha He is also a guide for the living entities Lord is not going to if you are a devotee of the Lord super soul is not going to if it is required to if you drop this phone no, no it should not go against gravity and it should not break because this is Krishna's phone doesn't happen, you drop it it will break

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the difference between the living entity (Kshetrajna) and the Super Soul, emphasizing that the Super Soul remains undivided while residing in everyone's heart, and that Krishna, as the cause of everything (Sarvakarana Karanam), is present within every effect.

so anyway the key point here is that we don't have to repeat many times that the living entity the kshetrajna is different from the super soul super soul is different and super soul see super soul without getting divided can he not be in each one's heart he can be beautiful example his son that prabhupada is giving material example is there son is appearing on everybody's head and each person is thinking he is on my head so in the same way the super soul without getting divided one chiradaksha vishnu is guiding every is in everybody's heart and krishna says it's me because it is his expansion the lord the supreme lord govindamadi purusham he is also inside every atom inside every heart that is as a cause of everything in every effect the cause resides is it not in every effect the cause resides within the atom or in other words within the material energy within the living entity the lord is there that is apart from the super soul super soul is only law of the lord is it not govindamadi sarvakarana karanam as sarvakarana karanam he is there in every every effect in this material world he is there that is a uniqueness of krishna when we say krishna is supreme personality of godhead that is what it is sarvakarana karanam within every kind of within his expansion within vishnu expansion also the cause of vishnu expansion is krishna he is there simultaneously one and different and simultaneously how they are one and different the detail is difference between krishna and vishnu krishna and material energy krishna and jiva how it is one and different description of how it is one and how it is different is little different but it is all expansion of one supreme personality of godhead sarvakarana karanam

**Summary:** A question is posed about the necessity of the Lord's supervision in the spiritual world, considering the absence of the Paramatma's function as seen in the material world.

any questions mike madhu pandit guru thank you so much for the explanation so generally we find very detailed information given in his purport like amazingly detailed and the description is the lord through this first quadruple expansion then the second quadruple expansion and he comes in this what is called parinamavada the transformation of energies of the lord finally we reach the understanding that the lord is in every heart as you described and that way he supervises and in one sense also because the jiva needs protection he may not is impartial but like a father is looking from a distance the child doing something and he is still witnessing everything so it also said in the scriptures that in the stage of the jiva that becomes by the mercy of the lord enlightened self-realized through the eyes of or the way of seeing the lord in the heart of the self-realized soul is declared is not anymore impartial because the lord in two-handed form or according to the jiva is liberated becomes in that turns into that self proportionally to the development of the soul so the question is that he supervises everything also through this analysis in the external energy but the question is in the spiritual world does he requires this sort of vigilance or this sort of being vigilant like a police forces how the interaction because we don't have so many informations in the spiritual world actually Srila Prabhupada gives a main fantastic description in the fifth the whole I think it's the fifth chapter of Chaitanya Charita Amrita the voice of Nityananda Valarama but he doesn't touch the point of the Paramatma because Paramatma in the spiritual world doesn't exist the function of Paramatma as we see only happens for this three-dimensional world so the question is in the spiritual world is the lord in need to supervise every jiva there

**Key Quote:** "As Paramatma, not required in the spiritual world. Doesn't have to sit next to the Atma. But as Krishna, as a cause, he is there within the Atma."
**Summary:** The speaker answers that the Paramatma is not required in the spiritual world, but Krishna, as the cause, is present within the Atma in His unmanifested form, manifesting in the material world through the Paramatma's expansion.

... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Lila. So therefore the Lord is there as Paramatma. Very specific kind of Lila. This kind of Lila is not required in the spiritual world. So as Paramatma, not required in the spiritual world. Doesn't have to sit next to the Atma. But as Krishna, as a cause, he is there within the Atma, in his unmanifested form. By me in my unmanifested form, I pervade everywhere. Not only here, everywhere he pervades. That pervading is different from all pervading expansion of, Lila expansion of the Paramatma. So that way Krishna is always everywhere, directly and indirectly in control of everything. So Ishwara Ha Parama Krishna. So that Parama Krishna, that Ishwara, that Ishwara effect is manifesting in the material world through Paramatma, through an expansion of Paramatma. This is what, you know, putting together everything else that we read about. This is what I understand. And somewhere there is one line in Chaitanya Charitamrita, Prabhupada says, there is no Paramatma expansion in this spiritual world. In Chaitanya Charitamrita. It says so. Prabhupada says so. And at the same time, somewhere else, the Lord is always seated in the heart of the living entity. You want to reconcile these two things, then Lord is always seated in the heart of the Jeeva also. Here, when you say Paramatma in the heart of the Jeeva, it is in this body. But there when Krishna is seated in the heart of Jeeva means as a cause he is there. Nothing can be separated from the cause. This is my understanding.

**Key Quote:** "Achieving anything in this material world is nothing but very nicely to oversimplify, just reconfiguring matter."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that achieving anything in the material world is simply reconfiguring matter using Jnana (knowledge), Bala (strength), and Kriya (skill), illustrating with examples like building a temple and the difference between rich and poor.

In this line of thought, when you initiated your dissertation, you also mentioned that as with this material, I cleansed my face using elements of matter to… For an end. Right So you say that we gather elements like concrete, iron to create a temple. Yes. You configure matter. Yes but you mentioned something peculiar because you say the temple is existing. It's existing. Commander I see. Training.束致. Can you elaborate please? You see nothing, nobody created anything. Before let us say only plain land was there. Then what happened? Jnana, Bala, Kriya, three things mixed together and this temple was manifest. Energy did not manifest. Energy was already there. Jnana, Bala and Kriya, what does it do? It reconfigures matter. Somewhere else different matter is there, it brings together. What is a rich man and a poor man? Difference. In the configuration of a rich man, money is in his pocket. When so many donors gave and we built this temple, what did it happen? You went, you used Jnana, Bala, Kriya. The money moved from his pocket to you as a collector. Then it came and the money moved from here to the shopkeeper. He moved that matter here. That's all. It's just nothing but very... Achieving anything in this material world is nothing but very nicely to oversimplify. Just reconfiguring matter. And to reconfigure matter, you need three things: Intelligence, Jnana, Bala, Kriya. Balas are different types. You may have financial Bala, this Bala, that Bala, physical Bala, financial Bala, all these things. Emotional Bala. Tejas is called Bhagavato Balena, Bhagavato Veeryena, Bhagavato Tejasa, we say, when you do something. These are all things required to do something. Okay. Virya is intelligent. Tejas is emotional strength. Bala is physical strength. Only by physical strength, intellectual strength and emotional strength are the three kinds of Bala.

**Key Quote:** "Devotees achieve things which is beyond their individual Jnana Bala Kriya."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of skills (Kriya) and how Krishna helps devotees by providing the necessary Jnana, Bala, and Kriya, enabling them to achieve things beyond their individual capacities through faith and recognizing Krishna as the proprietor.

Then you need Jnana. Then you need Kriya. Kriya is skills, expertise. I can make it... I can type something in a typewriter by looking at A and pressing A, B, in a clumsy way. I can type something in a typewriter by looking at A and pressing A, B in a clumsy way. Whereas an expert typist, the same machine, same... I also have knowledge how typing happens. The typist also has knowledge how typist happens. But the typist has knowledge and skill. I have only knowledge. I can clumsily type. The typist can type. Knowledge and skill. So skill is required. So to achieve anything in this material world, certain skills are required. So if you don't have... If you don't have an architecture, you don't have an object. You have the person. You have the machine. You have the machine. So you have the person. architect skill, then you have, if you want to build a temple, you have to get an architect. Again, it is reconfiguring that brain. That brain somewhere else, instead of doing some other work, you give temple work to him, he will work. That's all. And then output will come. So, every challenge in the material world, every achievement challenge, you should just reduce it to reconfiguring matter. Big deal. Nothing. What is there? Just you have to reconfigure. But I need all these things, Bala, all these things. So, you have to work. And this is where Krishna helps. He gives the Bala. Whatever shot of Bala, he will give. I maintain what you have, I provide what you lack. Whatever skill you lack, I will give. So, therefore, devotees achieve things which is beyond their individual Jnana Bala Kriya. Each of us are having a corpus of Jnana Bala Kriya at different times. As we grow in life, according to what is released by Kala. And it is this we use. But then, you know, if we have faith in Krishna, that it is Krishna's work, proprietor of the work is Krishna, fruit of the work is Krishna's, miracles will happen. Jnana Bala Kriya, because Jnana Bala Kriya of the scale of Krishna will come and play there. Because you are recognizing the work is Krishna's, fruit is for Krishna, then the scale of that.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna will run your day."
**Summary:** The best time to chant Hare Krishna is early in the morning with a fresh mind, before the day's activities begin, to have a deeper and more effective connection with Krishna, allowing Him to guide the day.

Hare Krishna Prabhu, when should one chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra? The best time to chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra is after a long sleep, when you wake up, because your mind is fresh. The reason being, a fresh mind is required. What does a fresh mind mean? Once you start your day, so many thoughts, this and that, it keeps like a guna, kala, karma will be churning inside you, and something and all will be coming in your mind. In the midst of that, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare... So one side you are mechanically chanting, the other side all this thinking is going on. So that is not a quality chanting. You are not touching, unless the shabda that you chant goes inside through your ears into the heart. Effectiveness is very less. As I said, it is a science. If you take a piece of iron and keep it near the fire, you will get a little heat. Put it inside the fire, red hot. A little far away, a little heat. So you want a little heat from Hare Krishna, or you want a full fire? Full fire means attentively, early morning, before your day's prarabdha karma starts, finish your association. Finish your association with Krishna. Krishna will run your day. Your life will become smooth. He will run your day. Externally there may be so many difficulties. External difficulty is not the measure of difficulty.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of repeatedly reminding ourselves that the holy name is not an ordinary sound vibration.

So you all are already familiar with the principles of soulful japa, which you are already, to different degrees, you have been practicing. But the basic principles need repeated reminders again and again to understand nicely that how this is not an ordinary vibration. If you don't repeatedly tell ourselves, feed into our mind, our subconscious mind, the nama tattva, the principles of nama avatara, by default we are going to think that it is an ordinary vibration. We are going to think. So, because we see, we are hearing sounds, so many sounds we are hearing. So we hear this sound also like that.

That is a danger. Just like so many people saw 5000 years back when Krishna came. Oh, my god. Why? Why did he come? Why did he come? as him being one among so many persons who have moved along. Similarly, Krishna has taken incarnation, Kali Kale Naamo Rupe Krishna Avatara. He has come in the form of the holy name. So his holy name is his, himself. Avatara means himself. And if proactively we don't teach our mind to perceive this sound as Krishna in his Shabda Vigraha, all Satchidananda Shabda Vigraha, if we don't teach our mind, as soon as we chant or hear Naama, we won't feel that reverence towards him, respect towards him,

**Summary:** The speaker states that the holy name is Krishna's incarnation and that Srila Prabhupada explains how mercy flows from the name through analogies.

we will not feel. More or less, we will treat the holy name like an impersonal sound. Once in a while something you may remember, Oh Krishna is this Krishna himself. That is not enough. Once in a while is not enough. Throughout each bead, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. It is Krishna himself that obviously you don't have to repeat again and again if it is embedded in your subconscious. After several, you know, contemplation of the Naama Tattva and application of that, that means chant and hear in practice every day with the background knowledge, transcendental knowledge. Why, how, when, where, about this incarnation. For this, and with respect to how this incarnation affects us or how it is effective in changing our consciousness. How the mercy flows into our heart from this Naama. We are chanting for the mercy of Krishna. Krishna Naama is Krishna's incarnation. So how this mercy flows, that mechanism is also described by Srila Prabhupada through various analogies. So these analogies I will explain, two, three analogies, two, three of them that Prabhupada talks is something which is extremely important for us to get the right perception of what happens to us when we chant Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Chaitanya Charitamrita reveals that Krishna Naama is a Surya of Satchitananda... Existence, knowledge and bliss. It's an infinite source. Because that is Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's name is the sun of eternity, knowledge and bliss, which is the natural atmosphere for the soul.

Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Chaitanya Charitamrita reveals that Krishna Naama is a Surya of Satchitananda. Surya of Satchitananda means son of Satchitananda. What is normal son? It's a son of light and heat. Now we are talking about son of Satchitananda. Light and heat is energy. So son of Satchitananda means Sat, Chit and Ananda energy. Existence, knowledge and bliss. It's an infinite source. Because that is Krishna. Krishna is Satchitananda Vigraha, Anadhi Radhi Govinda, Sarva Karna Karna. So Krishna Naama is a Surya of Satchitananda. Krishna is Surya of Satchitananda. Krishna Naama is also Surya of Satchitananda. All that our soul seeks in this world or in the spiritual world is to be immersed in this Sat, Chit and Ananda Shakti. That is our natural atmosphere. Whereas now the soul is in the atmosphere of Asat Shakti, Achit Shakti and Nirananda Shakti. This is Maya energy. There is internal energy, spiritual energy of the Lord. Satchitananda energy. Sat means eternity. We all want eternal life. We all want eternal relationship. We all want eternal love. There is no doubt about it. But in the bodily life we never get any of these things. So soul's nature is to seek Sat. Chit, pure knowledge, pure understanding, not ignorance. And Ananda means bliss, love, loving exchanges, exchanges of loving, exchanges of pleasure. These are all very natural for the soul.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the soul is eternally hungry in the material world and uses the analogy of iron in fire to explain how chanting affects us.

But somehow or the other even though very natural for us in this material world we are always defeated in our efforts for Satchitananda. So soul is always incomplete in this material world. Therefore it is eternally it is hungry. Never satisfied. So Krishna Nama is Surya of Satchitananda. The Surya of Satchitananda. And now Prabhupada explains how this works. When you put a piece of iron in the fire, the heat moves from the fire to the piece of iron. And gradually the piece of iron gets heated little by little. The longer it stays it gets heated and becomes red hot. The iron gets the quality of fire. At least 5 to 6 times Prabhupada has explained this phenomenon of how chanting works. So it is very important for us to remember this analogy of Prabhupada. Because from this analogy many things we understand about the phenomena of how actually Hare Krishna chanting influences us,

Sat Shakti Chitti Shakti Ananda Shakti Nam Nam Akari Boudha Nija Sarva Shakti Tatrarthita Niyamita Smaranena Kalaha That Lord Chaitanya says the Lord has unlimited names and in each of His names He has invested all His Shakti.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Shakti Avesha Nama and how associating with it cleanses the heart by replacing negative energies with positive ones.

and the person whose name it is. So that person now you understand very clearly. There is sun. There is sunlight, which is the energy of the sun. And it reflects on the let's say on the pond. You see a reflection of the sun. Similarly the sound we utter is not the Shuddha Nama now. It is the incarnation of the Shakti of the Lord. So Prabhupada explains using the word Shakti Avesha Nama. In New York in three lectures Prabhupada says he talks about he introduces his word Shakti Avesha Nama. That Nama that we utter in our conditioned state is the Nama in which which Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says I have invested all the powers. Who invests? Nama Prabhu invests. His Shuddha Nama invests. So first we associate with Shakti Avesha Nama. What happens when we associate with Shakti Avesha Nama? We are associating with the ocean of Sat Chit and Ananda energies. Because of that Chetodarpana Marjanam happens. That means cleansing the heart means what? Sat is Asat is replaced by Sat. Achit is replaced by Chit. Nirananda is replaced by Ananda. They are all energies. Sat is an energy. Asat is an energy. Chit is an energy. Achit is an energy. Ananda is an energy. Nirananda is an energy.

you are chanting the holy name of the Lord in vain. Vain means you are not taking full advantage. He has come for a purpose. He has come to enter your heart. And to turn your iron like soul into Sat Chit Ananda. That is his purpose. And you are not fulfilling his purpose. You chant Hare Krishna Mala one to sixteen Malas. But your mind is roaming everywhere not heard one name. Or heard accidentally. Just imagine Accidental hearing has made us devotees. Accidental hearing has made us devotees. If we hear the sixteen rounds What will happen? What will happen? What will happen? What will happen? What will happen? What will happen? What will happen to us? It will never fail. Put the iron in the fire it will get red hot. But if you put the iron in the fire once Oh I should hear Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama You are in the fire. Slowly you have forgotten and come out of the fire. Correct? Again you realize No, no, no I should hear. It goes into the fire again. Again Forget. What is forgetting? Thinking. You start thinking of different things. Thinking is the biggest enemy during japa. Any kind of thinking. Even philosophical thinking. Analyzing, thinking. No. Thinking is different. Thoughts are different. Thoughts that this is Krishna is different. How this is Krishna? That is thinking. Not full faith that this is Krishna. That is thought. The moment you think you cannot hear. So You put iron in the fire take it out, take it out, take it out Inside 100 years you do will it get red hot? Will it get red hot? You keep some water for boiling on the stove It gives 95 degrees heat. Take it out of the stove. Keep it. When it gets cold, keep it. When it gets cold, keep it. When it gets hot, keep it. When it gets cold, take it out. Does it ever boil in life?

There is a fire. Go near the fire. You will get little heat. Go into the fire. And come out. Still it will never become red hot. So our complete Red hot means complete self realization if you want. We have to everyday stay in the fire. We have to practice staying in the fire. For two hours. Which doesn't happen overnight. Doesn't happen overnight. But it can be done. To lock the attention on the holy name. You get the power from the holy name itself. Because mind is crazy. You need a power to hold the mind. To control the mind. Mind by default according to guna, kala and karma mind unwinding the thoughts. Different thoughts. We are never keeping quiet. We are always thinking. Kala is unwinding. Kala should stop. To stop kala is not easy. To stop the flow of time is not easy. Only Krishna can do it. That means the Shakti can come only from the nama. This is another important faith that you need. For good quality japa you can do only by the mercy of the holy name. So we have to pray to the holy name. By your mercy my attention may be locked upon your shabdha.

It is a trick of the mind. If you teach a wrong habit if you don't want to change it that habit will become stronger and stronger even after 50 years you will not hear.

You get the point. See the danger of wrong habits. And also the power of good habits. You train your mind in 2-3 months to hearing japa. Completely everything.

But for me now there is a difference. For me there is a difference. I can only say that I am unable to experience Krishna dancing on my tongue. But Krishna is dancing on my tongue. But I am able to experience the Shakti. Today's japa I can experience today's Shakti. If I don't do my japa properly where is my consciousness? If I do my 16 rounds properly where is my consciousness? That means the Shaktis can be immediately experienced. Presence of a Shakti. So by cleansing our consciousness gradually we will be able to experience. We will be able to chant.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of rubber gloves to explain why we don't feel Krishna's presence on our tongue and reiterates that the energy for chanting comes from the holy name itself by following the golden command.

Increase the quality of chanting. And the highest thing is what Rupa Goswami says. Day when you will seek millions of tongues and millions of ears to taste the infinite taste in the Nama. That same Nama is there now also on our tongue when we chant. But it's like a put a rubber gloves keep it on the heater. You are touching the heater. But can you feel the heat? No. Why? In between there is rubber, insulator. But keep on touching what happens? Rubber will melt. Slowly heat will start. So in the same way even now we are touching Krishna is on our tongue. He is already. Krishna is dancing on our tongue. When we chant Krishna. We cannot feel it. We cannot simply imagine also. But we have to understand from the transcendental knowledge that all Shaktis are there. I have to do Chetodarpanam first. First stage of my relationship with the holy name is cleansing my heart. Cleansing my heart for that Krishna is shining his transcendental energies into our heart. So anyway this is little background for all of you. The key point I wanted to tell you is that the energy, enthusiasm to finish 100 rounds 200 rounds whatever rounds you want is coming from the Nama himself. How does it come from the Nama himself? By following the golden command. Chant and exactly same sound you hear.

This habit of thinking japa if you stop it is just like you know one rupee and one million rupees. One rupee is also rupee. One million is also rupee. You are thinking japa is like one rupee. Hearing japa is like one rupee. Both are thinking they are doing japa. But one is becoming richer and richer and richer and richer and richer. Each bead million times. One million one million next bead, one million next bead, one million next bead. The other person is chanting one rupee, one rupee, one rupee, one rupee. It depends upon our how effectively we follow the simple golden command of Shri Prabhupada. Because sometimes we tend to think that something like that big thing to achieve I should be really you know it is a very difficult thing. That also you should demolish. One command of Prabhupada following is not very difficult. He is saying you follow it because you don't think that you should follow it.

And you are touching Krishna. Thinking is a rubber gloves. Prabhupada was asked this particular question. Should we think of Krishna's pastime during japa? He said no just here. Just here. Because now our thinking is within the three modes. Krishna doesn't say I come as avathara as thought. For Prabhupada, thinking, chanting, preaching, everything is same. Because for him he has reached that absolute stage. Through any incarnation Prabhupada can touch Krishna. Prabhupada thinks of Krishna's image in the mind. It is Krishna. Prabhupada chants Krishna name. It is Krishna. When I think of Krishna's image in my mind it is not Krishna. When I chant Hare Krishna, it is Krishna. Why? Because Krishna has told is a easy way to access. The fact is that you see if my image of Krishna in my mind has to become pure. If my mind has to become pure, it is Krishna. So we should approach Krishna in the easiest merciful way in which even though you are impure even the beginner Krishna says I will come. Take advantage of the nama avathara.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the difference between a true householder (Grahastha) and one who is simply attached to household life (Grahamedhi), emphasizing spiritual advancement.

Purport by Shrila Prabhupada: the words ग्रह में दिशु कर्म सुमीन in household duties, another word is also used here सर्वात्म नानु रूपाम. The purport is that a wife should not only be equal to her husband in age, character, and qualities, but must be helpful to him in his household duties. The household duty of a man is not to satisfy his sense gratification, but to remain with a wife and children and at the same time attain advancement in spiritual life. One who does not do so is not a householder, but a ग्रह में दी. Two words are used in Sanskrit literature: one is ग्रहस्था and the other is

युगा धर्मा. In युगा धर्मा, simply by the यद्ञ of chanting this Hare Krishna Mahamantra. यह विश्णास का भूलनाई होगा। और अब जब विश्णास हो जाता है, तो आप यहां एक छूच को आपके पास बदली का रह सकते हैं। हमें आश्रमां के बाद एक थोड़ी बुल पाश हो जाता है. But the holy name is so powerful that if one takes this medicine of the holy name on a daily basis, then all kinds of adjustments will happen with the bodily, mental situation and somehow engage in service of the Lord. You will see that we will be able to come out of this. We will be able to awaken our transcendental knowledge in spite of being neither here nor there, neither a proper brahmachari, neither a proper grahastha, neither a proper sanyasi. So Prabhupada always said forget all this, you are servant of Krishna, just serve Krishna. Those are all incidental. One should not pin so much faith on all those things. We have to follow those ashrama principles.

**Key Quote:** "Where there is chanting, maya cannot enter."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how chanting the Hare Krishna mantra protects devotees from the anxieties of material existence, especially in Kali Yuga, and provides a unique, sheltered environment.

At the same time, for the outside world we have to set an example, so we have to be very, very careful. Even though we know that there is nothing, there is no perfect ashrama that can be followed in the present environment. But those who chant the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, those who serve the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, because the spiritual potency comes from the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, one will be able to, in whatever ashram he is there, he will be able to easily follow those principles. Even if the environment is not there, in a sense he will be able to follow all those things. There is no difficulty for a devotee who is chanting sixteen rounds to follow the principles of any of these ashramas. Not at all difficult, because the holy name is so powerful. Chanting is so powerful. It is not that you chant Hare Krishna sixteen rounds and your material life is in a mess. It will not be like that. The chanting of Hare Krishna is so powerful that it will, in the midst of all this, just like look at the devotees in Hare Krishna hill or any of our temples. The outside world is such a big mess. And here devotees have no such thing. They are simply chanting, dancing, doing their service. Anxieties of struggle for existence is being spared for everybody in this Hare Krishna hill. How is it possible in Kali Yuga? Where will you get this luxury in Kali Yuga? Where you don't have to think about your eating, sleeping, waiting, defending. You don't have to think. You only think of serving Prabhupada, serving Prabhupada. Your whole life gets going. Nowhere, because material energy does not allow that. Maya does not allow that, because maya cannot enter when there is Sankirtana. Where there is chanting, maya cannot enter. So we keep ourselves under protection of the divine energy of the deities, of the holy name of Guru's mercy. By all these things we are actually continuously on a day to day basis we are protected and that is why we are in this particular situation.

I am getting freedom from material struggle for material existence. If you don't count these blessings then we will not be able to feel that gratitude to Shila Prabhupada. It is not a small thing.

**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about spiritual convictions, explaining that they are also affected by the modes of nature, and that serving the Guru helps one develop the necessary punya and sattva guna.

any any other questions here so you said determination and conviction is affected by three modes what about spiritual convictions suppose we have conviction about Krishna consciousness those things are they affected by peoce not they are also affected by it ằ three modes of material nature that is a reason why our conviction is not the Why We Live Krishna consciousness Somebody Whose soul is convinced that means that So your level is convinced it takes time by Association by proper kind of a you know body coming into a certain situation body coming into a certain situation, sattvic situation, hearing the transcendental words, one gets convinced to start with. That conviction has to become conviction of the soul. That is when you become nishta. There are stages are there. So initially all the things that we exhibit, that is why it is said without getting that punya, one cannot come into Krishna consciousness. That punya Prabhupad gives, by serving Prabhupad's movement, we get that punya. Punya is connected to the body. So there is a bodily qualification coming up due to service to one's Guru. Once that comes up, then you enjoy higher values from this same body. To have a body with sattva guna is a gift. When you serve Srila Prabhupad slowly, you will come into that guna. When you come into that guna, कुना जि disadvantages have come into that guna when you hear Bhagavatam and everything then impact will be much more. So our journey is through the yantra only. It starts through the yantra. Thats a very good question or you ask because in the Bhagavad Gilbert that when the kshetra is been described, you will see one

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of chanting and attending classes to illustrate the fleeting nature of initial spiritual inspiration and the need for sustained effort.

Very simple, for this sustained perception, you have to understand one big secret: how this yantra works. Just like you hear what is good chanting, one seminar you hear, three, four days you chant well, then again it goes back. Or you hear a good class, nice perception, so clear everything is, you feel that okay, now I don't think, you know, I will fall for female beauty anymore. When that perception is there, you will feel. But why is it not consistent? Why does it not sustain?

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of practice, defined as repeated contemplation and application of spiritual truths, to change one's default perception.

Is there a way to make it sustain? Very important to know, yes, there is a way to make it sustain, abhyasena, you practice. Practice means repeated contemplation on these truths. When you repeatedly contemplate on these truths, that this is the truth, your default perception has to change. You have to understand that your present perception has not come from out of akash, it has come out of your own creation in the past. It is all in the kshetra, it is in the field. The atma is kshetrajna. In your field it is created. That default perceptions are created. So that default perception, how did it get created? By repeated contemplation and application. You think and then you apply it. That means you use that.

With all the reasons behind it, there will be so many reasons behind it, that with those reasons you will intellectually contemplate first. If you want to believe something, you need some reasons. Right? Aha, now yes, this I accept, yes, yes. So with reasons. So that is called intellectual contemplation. So intellectually you contemplate with the reason.

**Key Quote:** "When you encounter something, then you have to apply that."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses applying new perceptions in life and provides specific guidance for Brahmacharis (celibate students) regarding interactions with women, emphasizing avoidance.

Then that perception slowly sinks inside us. Then we have to start applying those perceptions in life. When you encounter something, then you have to apply that. And when you repeatedly apply that, that will become your default perception. Default perception. Of course. Of course. When it comes, there are different rules for managing different perceptions. For instance, Brahmacharis. Perception of females. Okay, Prabhu told in the class, I have to apply. So I have to look at every female and apply. If you try, you will finish. So for Brahmacharis, the stage of life is that, no, no, you completely avoid it. Yes. You observe in other things. Completely avoid that.

Don't bother about that. Don't bother about that. And in case, you have to see, okay, the golden rule is there. See everybody as mother. You have to see, no? You have to go out, you have to see. So Brahmachari is not in the process of, you know, changing perception. No. No. You are changing perception by, by the process that I said, with respect to female. To many other things, yes. With respect to holy name, contemplate, apply, contemplate, apply, contemplate, apply. Every day you are chanting. Before that, you do pre-Japa. You contemplate. While you are doing Japa, you apply, apply, apply. Your default perception of holy name will change. Your default perception of hearing. Everything.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a car and the principle of 'disuse atrophy' to explain how unused perceptions weaken and fade away, reinforcing the Brahmachari's path of detachment.

Everything will change. So where to apply this? But the secret is this. If you want to change something, this is the method. And then what? Then the question may come, then as a Brahmachari, if I am, if I have never contemplated and if I have never counted, then what will happen to me? My default perception will remain, isn't it? Same philosophy holds with the Brahmachari. Same philosophy holds with the Brahmachari. Same philosophy holds with the Brahmachari. Same philosophy holds with the Brahmachari. And he is saying, this will change, this will change. The one who doesn't have a strong mental perception, he will become a useless thing. It will be the same principle that has been passed on to anything that has never been used. He is saying, this is the entire essence of these Vedic principles. It will go away. It will weaken away, no Dhamma. If you don't use a car, even a brand new car, keep it there for 10 years, won't start, it will not start. Don't use it, it will not come. In medicine also there is a medical term.

**Key Quote:** "If you go on seeing female as enjoyable, enjoyable, enjoyable, it becomes empowered, empowered, empowered and one day you will feel, so enjoyable it is. It's all in the head."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of diabetes and insulin to illustrate how repeated contemplation and application amplify perceptions, both good and bad, emphasizing the power of the mind.

Terminology also, disuse atrophy they say. If something is not used regularly, it will die. So same thing, think it's just like in diabetics, they say, if you don't use your pancreas, instead you artificially put insulin from outside, what you are doing is you are killing it more. So finally, your increase of insulin has to go on, your dose of insulin go on increasing, they say. Same thing, think like pancreas, you got perception in your mind, it's all in your subtle body, no? If you go on using it, it becomes stronger and stronger. If you go on seeing female as enjoyable, enjoyable, enjoyable, it becomes empowered, empowered, empowered and one day you will feel, so enjoyable it is. It's all in the head. Amplify, amplify, amplify, amplify, amplify, amplify. Nothing is there outside that person who is there, maybe it's, let's say every day you say, see one female. No amplification happening in her, but you, day by day, amplification, amplification, amplification, amplification. Nothing is that, female is just walking up and down. In your head, it is amplifying. So default perception, any perception, good perception or bad perception, it is amplifying.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the process of strengthening or weakening perceptions through repeated contemplation and application or starvation, and suggests the authorized way for Brahmacharis to engage with potentially distracting concepts is through hearing Srimad Bhagavatam.

By repeated contemplation and repeated application, it gets strengthened. By starving it, it becomes weak and dead. So don't have to fear. The Brahmachari's method of removing what perception that you have got before joining is gone, of female, it will all just fuse off if you don't touch it for many years. That is the principle of Brahmacharya. If at all you touch it, you hear like this thin waste daughters of, a very purifying Shabda it is. Your attraction to thin waste daughters will go away, Their description of beautiful breasts in Bhagavatam, you hear that, you hear Shabda, it will go away. Female beauty is described in Bhagavatam. You hear that story of Puranjana all that thing you hear?

### association with saintly persons, spiritual perfection, mercy

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Somehow or other, if one meets a saintly person completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favour, then one's life mission becomes complete."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the importance of associating with saintly persons and receiving their favor, as highlighted in the Srimad Bhagavatam and exemplified by Srila Prabhupada's experience with his guru.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 22, Text No. 5: Tavasandarshanadeva Chinname Sarvasamchayaha Yatsvayam Bhagavanpretya Dharmamaharirakshisho. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace Shri La Prabhupada: Now I have resolved all my doubts simply by meeting you, for your lordship has very kindly and clearly explained the duty of a king who desires to protect his subjects. PURPORT BY SHRI LA PRABHUPADA: Manu described herewith the result of seeing a great saintly person. Lord Chaitanya says that one should always try to associate with saintly persons, because if one establishes a proper association with a saintly person, even for a moment, one attains all perfection. Somehow or other, if one meets a saintly person and achieves his favour, then the entire mission of one's human life is fulfilled. In our personal experience, we have actual proof of this statement of Manu. Once, we had the opportunity to meet Vishnupat Shri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj and on first sight, he requested this humble self to preach his message in the western countries. There was no preparation for this but somehow or other, he desired it and by his grace, we are now engaged in executing his order which has given us a transcendental occupation and has saved and liberated us from the occupation of material activities. Thus, it is actually a fact that if one meets a saintly person completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favour, then one's life mission becomes complete. What is not possible to achieve in thousands of lives can be achieved in one moment if there is an opportunity to meet a saintly person. It is therefore enjoined in Vedic literature that one should always try to associate with saintly persons and try to dissociate oneself from the common man because by one word of a saintly person, one can be liberated from material entanglement. A saintly person has the power because of his spiritual advancement to give immediate liberation to the conditioned soul. Here Manu admits that all his doubts are now over because Karadhamma has very kindly

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual growth happens by constant shower of mercy of the spiritual master, mercy of the deities, mercy of prasadam, mercy of great devotees like Tulsimaharani, mercy of holy rivers, mercy of holy dham."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the material paradigm of hard work guaranteeing success with the spiritual principle of advancement through receiving mercy from various transcendental sources.

Here, Srila Prabhupada in the Bhaktivedanta purports, he explains the principle of association with great saintly persons. Even a moment of association, sadhu-sangha, one can attain all perfection by achieving his favor. This is a very important principle in the process of spiritual advancement for every devotee. Normally, everything in this world is achieved. That's the paradigm of everyone, that I work hard and I have to achieve. I work hard and I have to be successful. So when we come to spiritual life also, naturally the tendency is to think that I work very hard for my sadhana, etc. and then result is guaranteed. In other words, it's like making spiritual advance, turning spiritual advancement to simply following some process. In the material world, it's like that. You go through a process, the result has to be there in the end. So we have to be very careful in our mind to change this paradigm. This paradigm has been ingrained into us through our education system. We are all victim of this. By default, our thinking is like this. It is only when you understand the principle of spiritual flow of mercy, how actually spiritual growth happens, not like how you learn in school. Spiritual growth happens by constant shower of mercy of the spiritual master, mercy of the deities, mercy of prasadam, mercy of great devotees like Tulsimaharani, mercy of holy rivers, mercy of holy dham.

**Key Quote:** "Everything that we have today is a combination of whatever we desire, whatever is our attitude towards the desire and what we have received from a transcendental source."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that spiritual advancement is about receiving key understandings through a descending process, highlighting the permanent nature of transcendental knowledge compared to temporary material knowledge.

What is this mercy, mercy, mercy? How does it impact me? How does it impact a sadhaka? Spiritual advancement means receiving key understandings through the descending process. At least we should, even if our mind is stuck in a process-oriented thinking, turn it into it is a descending process. That today if I have some advancement, it's not because I read Prabhupada's books alone, not because I thought a lot and I understood. It is because I read Prabhupada's books and Prabhupada gave his mercy. It is because I thought about all this and Krishna in the heart gave me the realization. Realization and understanding. So everything that we have today is a combination of whatever we desire, whatever is our attitude towards the desire and what we have received from a transcendental source. All that we receive from a transcendental source, it is not temporary. It is permanent. It stays with us. In the material world, so many energies come and go. You say spiritual, if you do your PhD this life, next life that knowledge is gone. But if there is a mercy of from the transcendental source of enlightenment, that will remain with the soul even though it may get covered, but doesn't matter. It remains. It's an eternal asset for the soul.

**Key Quote:** "Our business in spiritual life will be successful if we constantly collect mercy."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of constantly seeking and begging for the mercy of the Lord in various forms, even within the seemingly repetitive processes of daily sadhana.

So our business in spiritual life will be successful if we constantly collect mercy. Of course you cannot go on like plucking a flower, you cannot collect mercy. Mercy has to be begged. So the begging mode, anticipating mode is extremely important for a devotee. The devotee is constantly in the mode of begging and anticipating the mercy of the Lord in various forms. Just like we can say, okay, every day we are coming for sadhana, it is a process. 4.15 you have to be there, then samsara dava has to be sung, then Tulsi has to be, Tulsi Maharani's song has to be sung, she has to be glorified, then you go, Prabhupada Puja, etc., etc., all these processes you have to follow. So in the neophyte, a devotee thinks, this is, okay, I have to go for this, I have to go for this, this is a process. Even though externally every day it appears to be the same thing, 4.15 Mangalarati, 4.15 same song, every day same song, samsara dava, samsara dava, samsara dava, you don't get bored? 30, 40 years same song, samsara dava, you don't get bored. The fact is that we don't get bored. Why? Every day the mercy coming out of the altar to each devotee is different. Externally it is same, internally it is different. What plays in the devotee's heart, his understanding, his realization, his situation for that day, his faith, his prayers, all are different. So you don't get bored. That is a variety. So every day is different. Every day Mangalarati is different. Every day Guru Puja is different. Every day Tulasi Aarti is different.

**Key Quote:** "Ultimately the Adhikara, the qualification comes when the spiritual master is pleased...because ultimately essence of all Jnana is what? Service to the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the contamination of imbalanced effort on the jnanic path, emphasizing that true qualification and understanding come through service to the Lord and pleasing the spiritual master, not through intellectual speculation alone.

Like Prabhupada said, I can kick out Maya in one second. So we should hold on to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, beg for the mercy of the Lord. There is another kind of contamination when there is an imbalanced effort on a devotee's path, Jnanic path. You have to think, think, think. You have to cross sometimes this thinking stage. Sometimes you have to think. We all thought about it and came to Krishna consciousness. Go on thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking everything. When we have to put effort to think, then that is speculation. Thinking is not wrong, but thinking will automatically come. Thoughts will automatically come. When you struggle to think, then it is Jnana-Prayasa. Then it is Jnana-Prayasa. Unnecessary endeavor. You have a philosophical question, you think too much, you cannot answer now. Jnana-Prayasa. Wait, get the Adhikara. Get the qualification. Adhikara for the soul means enough more services to be done. You have to raise your spiritual platform. Then you will get the answer. Then you will have qualification to understand the answer. It is not that for every question that you ask, you have to get an answer now. What is the use of you getting the answer if you cannot understand the answer? So the question has to be raised, no doubt. It is our nature to raise question. But then we have to understand that ultimately the Adhikara, the qualification comes when the spiritual master is pleased, when Guru is pleased, Srila Prabhupada is pleased with the devotee who is sincerely trying to advance and who is trying to serve him because ultimately essence of all Jnana is what? Service to the Lord. Essence of all realization is what? Devotional service to the Lord.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of Srila Prabhupada's books as a readily available source of his mercy, highlighting that the problem is not the lack of availability but the lack of desire to collect it.

it is all Lord's Leela. These words of Srila Prabhupada are printed in this form. His words are captured in sound. In recorded sound. If one has faith in Srila Prabhupada, then one can continuously receive his mercy. He can receive his mercy. Transcendently receive his mercy. Anybody can receive his mercy. That is why Prabhupada always stressed, distribute my books, distribute my books, distribute my books. This is the most important thing that Prabhupada considers as his contribution to the world, are not the temples, but it is the books. Srila Prabhupada himself has considered this to be most important contribution, which is coming from the spiritual world under the order of the Guru Parampara and Krishna, that he has contributed this to this world. It is his books. His books means his words. How by Lord Krishna's arrangement everything is recorded, every lecture he gave is recorded. Nowadays it is very common. In those days in 1965 and all, it has just come into being. Record player and all, just come into being. Even videos, audios and all, few black and white and all, it has just started. All those things are captured. Just imagine, you know, we are able to carry in a small, small empathy player, 800 lectures of a pure devotee. Imagine if you hear 800 lectures nicely, what will happen to you? Nothing is happening to us because we don't hear. It is available. We don't hear. Now the problem is not availability of mercy. Nobody wants to collect.

**Summary:** This segment discusses how to be conscious of Prabhupada by perceiving his qualities, desires, aspirations, and determination, rather than just focusing on his physical form.

which is a fact. You don't have to see Prabhupada. If you read his life history, he'll touch you. You can feel him. Therefore devotees should all read Srila Prabhupada's Leelas. They should hear, and they should read Srila Prabhupada's pastimes of how from 1965, he built up this movement, till he left this planet, all the different activities that he did. When you read it, then you'll be able to, you have to perceive a person, means you have to perceive that person's desire, you have to perceive that person's aspirations, you should perceive that person's purity, you have to perceive that person's Iccha Shakti. Perceiving, those things are perceiving the person. How do, a devotee asked me, how to be conscious of Prabhupada? It's not simply his form. You get stuck there. The person can be perceived by his interest. The person can be perceived by his determination. By his personal qualities, you can perceive a person. You can pinpoint, very uniquely, who was Prabhupada, by his determination to go to America and preach, by his desire to please his spiritual master, by his aspiration to spread Lord Chaitanya's movement to everywhere, irrespective of any country. His confidence and trust that the Holy Name is powerful enough to change everyone.

**Key Quote:** "Think of the process as a transcendental process of effort and mercy."
**Summary:** This segment answers a question about attending sadhana as a process, clarifying that it should be understood as a transcendental process involving both our effort and the mercy of the Lord and Srila Prabhupada.

Generally, sadhana we attend like a process. Will it be okay, Prabhu, or anything consciously we have to make some effort? It's a process. As you understand what process means to you. If it is a two-way process, if you think it is a two-way process, that means you are doing something and Prabhupada is also doing something to you. You are doing something and Prabhupada and Krishna is doing something to you. If this perception is there, then thinking of this as a process is fine. But normally in this material world, process generally means it's you put your effort only and the result has to be there. Or even your effort, somebody, all other people's effort, it's all visible, grossly visible efforts. In the material world also, process sometimes means this way and that way, people, all those things, combination, combination of... Just like a factory produces something, they say it is a... It was a process of teamwork, they will say. But here, it's not visible like that. It's a transcendental process. That means your effort you can see, grossly. But, the other effort that, that other mercy that comes from Prabhupada and Krishna and Lord in the heart, these things cannot be seen. If you are Shrabdha, you can capture it. You know this is coming from... You feel that it is mercy. So think of the process as a transcendental process of effort and mercy. Shrama, cheshta from our side, kripa from the Lord. Kripa from transcendence, effort from our side. So,

**Summary:** This segment contrasts the Vaishnava understanding of the guru as an eternal guide with the Mayavadi perspective, emphasizing the importance of complete surrender and faith in the spiritual master.

So we think, we understand it's an eternal process. I am eternally dependent upon my guru. I go to the spiritual world also, I depend upon my guru. Here he will teach me how to be liberated from material energy, how to purify. There he will teach me how to adopt the right kind of mood to serve the Supreme Lord. Nobody can go and directly serve the Supreme Lord. You need a, there is transcendental intelligence in the spiritual world. So there are masters in the spiritual world who knows how actually to please Krishna. You cannot just go and please Krishna the way you want. So my guru is eternal guru. He is my guru in my spiritual world also. That is the reason why we make a big issue about the guru issue. He is not a joke. When you surrender to a spiritual master, it's not a joke. That surrender that being talked about, the same faith that you have in Krishna has to be in the guru. Means what? Unless one is authorized by the predecessor spiritual master, one cannot become guru. That is why Prabhupada did not authorize anybody.

According to our Siddhanta, a person accepts a spiritual master, a person is a spiritual master, he has to, you know, surrender his soul to him. Is a person capable of taking that surrender? Is a person capable of transparently passing on to Krishna? And these two processes of capability cannot be self-certified. Can never be self-certified. You cannot suddenly feel convinced that I can do it. Prabhupada is saying, I was authorized. For first sight he requested this humble self to preach the message in the western countries. There is no preparation for this, but somehow or the other he desired it. Look at this. And by His grace we are now engaged in executing His order. By His grace. Which has given us a transcendental occupation. And has saved and liberated us. Prabhupada is saying, by giving this service to me, Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur has saved me. Thus it is actually a fact that if one meets a saintly person, completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favor, then one's life becomes

Because it's the beginning of devotional service, Shravananda. Beginning means the end. In devotional service there is not diversity. If one is encouraged in performing only one service, Ambarish Maharaj did the example, he can achieve full, the complete process. Beyond time. Yes. Because a particle of the infinite carries the infinite. In this infinite, it means devotional service is supreme. And this is what Prabhupada, as you clearly also exposed, is doing. Bringing the process in a practical and very easy accessible way. Depending on one's consciousness. This is Vyavasaya Yad Mika Budhir. Regardless of how you explain it, the amount of knowledge, scriptural knowledge, literal knowledge in that sense, literally. The person can become a scholar. But the Bhakta is above that because the process of revelation by the Lord, just . And then, I want to share with you one amazing history, just a few days ago. Before coming, Gargamuni Prabhupada told me, and had a relationship with this, that you already expertly exposed. When Prabhupada was in that period of history. Nowhere digital development was around. But somehow, this proves. It blew the body in the category of Trikalagya. Every one of us is somehow Trikalagya in many aspects. The father knows what the child is doing and, you know, seeing what he's going to do next. He is the father spiritually. It means that he spiritually is not like Krishna but is God-like.

So, before we continue with our japa yajna, I will give an orientation on doing soulful japa. Soulful japa. When you say soulful, we have our body, we have our mind, we have our soul. When you do japa, by putting our total self to chant and hear and worship the Lord's holy name, that is soulful japa. If you give only your tongue, that is mechanical japa. If you give your mind to hear the sound, that is called mindful japa. If you give your heart, along with the tongue, mind, you give your heart to chant and hear with feelings towards Nama Prabhu, feelings of appreciation, feelings of gratitude, feeling of love.

**Key Quote:** "But if you do mindful japa, you will automatically advance to heartful, soulful japa."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts mechanical and mindful japa, asserting that mindless japa is offensive and stagnates spiritual progress, while mindful japa naturally leads to soulful japa.

Then, that is called soulful japa. So, if we don't train our mind to hear what we chant, we do not even advance from mechanical japa to mindful japa. Mechanical japa to mindful japa. Mechanical japa, once you learn how to do, your tongue can finish sixteen rounds and your mind can be roaming everywhere. If you have some problem, particular problems, let's say some serious problems, that day, then you can chant sixteen rounds with your tongue. Your mind will be solving those problems, thinking of that, this, that. Or if you have some emotional showdown with someone, then that will not go away from the mind. Mind will be thinking, why did I do that, why did I, what did he do, she do, not fair, this thing, that thing, all those things because emotion comes. Doesn't stop analyzing, then gone, you are not able to hear. And if somehow or the other, we train ourselves for mindful japa, which is meaning to hear. Mindful japa means, already shabda has gone inside, through the ears. After quite some time, if you go on doing mindless japa, if you do mindless mechanical japa, that will not, there is no guarantee that you will go to the next level. Whole life you can be doing that. But if you do mindful japa, you will automatically advance to heartful, soulful japa.

**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa explains the difference between mindful and mechanical japa, emphasizing that japa is a relationship with the Lord and highlighting Srila Prabhupada's instruction to chant in exactly the same sound you hear.

It is not that you do mechanical japa, one day you will do mindful japa. And you go on doing mindful japa, one day you will do soulful japa, after purification. No. If you do mindless japa, because mindless japa is offensive japa. You are neglecting the Lord. There is no question of, you will stagnate there. If you do mindful japa, then soulful japa will automatically rise up, when your feelings for Krishna is awakened in your heart gradually. Feelings of surrender, all those things. So in, what is the difference between mindful japa and mechanical japa? In mindful japa, mind is there. In mechanical japa, mindless, mindlessness. There is no mind at all in chanting and hearing. Automatic, mechanical. Anything you repeat, you make your body repeat, it learns. So it is, mindless japa is impersonal japa. Actually, japa is a relationship with the naam avatara. So bead after bead, every bead is a relationship with the sound incarnation of the Lord. He is before us. So mindless means, we are neglecting him. So mindful japa means, each bead, you chant in exactly the same sound you hear. And this is the diamond command of, golden command of Srila Prabhupada. Chant Hare Krishna

**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges the value of mechanical japa as a commitment but emphasizes the importance of progressing to pure devotional service through mindful japa, identifying thinking as the main obstacle to hearing the chanting.

So this mechanical japa to just finish sixteen rounds, it's okay. At least there is one commitment I have committed to my spiritual master, I should finish sixteen rounds. But Prabhupada does not want us to always remain neophytes. He wants us to learn how to offer pure devotional service. Okay, in mechanical japa, as far as Krishna is concerned, we are not even feeling his presence. At least if you feel commitment to Srila Prabhupada, I am obeying Srila Prabhupada, so that much bhakti is there, even in mechanical japa. No, no, I have not finished my rounds. Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck, you finish mechanically. There is something there. So, God will bless you and Prabhupada will bless you. But Prabhupada will not expect, Prabhupada expects you to go beyond inattentive japa So, the key to mindful japa is to ensure that you are hearing the chanting. And what is the obstacle for hearing the chanting? Thinking, thought processing. When you are thinking, within the mind you are chattering.

As each shabda, there are only three shabdas, Hare Krishna and Rama in the Mahamantra.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of stacking bricks to illustrate the power of continuous hearing without thinking, leading to an immediate and profound effect on consciousness.

Hearing is a knowing. And also a doing because you have to ensure that no other hearing is there. Only one particular knowing and a particular knowing and not any other activity should be done and tasking should be done. Mind's business, mind's task is mind's nature is to task. Every moment we are always tasking something. Stop all tasking. Task only repetition. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. You should pile up just like you know if you have a brick on your hand. You have brick on another hand. The pressure on each hand is one brick load. Suppose instead of the second brick, I put the second brick on the same hand. Third brick on the same hand. What happens? Weight is more. Weight is more, right? Similarly, if you pile up hearing over hearing, that means without any thinking in the gap, hearing over hearing over stacking, stacking one brick over the other like that. Hearing over hearing over hearing will have fantastic effect of like iron put in the fire, becomes red hot. Our consciousness, you can immediately, immediate effect it is. Sometimes people say, like Hare Krishna chanting, you are not able to give people any immediate feeling effect. Just like somebody gives some some yogic process, so immediately they are feeling some peace, immediately something. Here also, because we don't teach people to hear, that is why they don't get immediate effect. If you teach them how to stack up and chant, even a new person, first time chanting, if he does that without thinking, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, he will be shocked. He will get such an experience that he would want to chant every day.

### soulful japa, Krishna's sound incarnation, purification, Nama Prabhu, Chinmaya Shabda

**Key Quote:** "The sound name of Krishna is very merciful, so therefore, Krishna himself is there, but it's in the name form."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that soulful japa allows one to touch Krishna's sound incarnation, leading to purification and the revelation of Krishna's various aspects, explaining that the holy name is Chinmaya Shabda, or conscious sound.

And by such soulful japa, you are, you are touching the holy name, touching Krishna's sound incarnation. Krishna, who is before us is Krishna, himself is before us. If you want Krishna's form before us, you need to qualify so much. The sound name of Krishna is very merciful, so therefore, Krishna himself is there, but it's in the name form. So in the name form, if we worship, slowly we get purified, then we even see all other aspects of Krishna. Krishna is not only name aspect, Krishna has form aspect, Krishna has got quality aspect, Krishna has got past time aspect, they are all Krishna. All that will be revealed from the, by Nama Prabhu. Why we call this Nama, Nama Prabhu? Because this sound is Chinmaya Shabda. There is Chinmaya Shabda and there is Jada Shabda. All the Shabdas in this world are Jada Shabda. There is no person involved in that sound. But when it comes to sound that let's say Prabhupada speaks, it's Chinmaya Shabda. Today you hear Prabhupada's lecture, Prabhupada is not separated from that. Eternally, he himself is speaking. Anytime you hear him, he is speaking as he gave the lecture, when he was sitting and giving lecture pre-1977. It is all Chinmaya Shabda. Bhagavad Gita, Krishna spoke, it's Chinmaya Shabda. Krishna's name is Chinmaya Shabda. Chinmaya, in normal thing you can say, it's conscious sound. But whose consciousness is it? Krishna's name is Krishna's consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna himself is sounding."
**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of having Shraddha (faith) that Krishna himself is present in the sound of the holy name, leading to jubilant hearing and delightful chanting.

So this is a very primary understanding that should have Shraddha. Shraddha that this is Krishna himself coming in the sound form. Krishna himself is sounding. Now I am sounding this if you take sounding as a verb, I am sounding this sound. I am sounding, therefore this sound is coming out. So in japa, we are actually chanting. Our tongue is chanting. But actually Krishna is mercifully, he is sounding it. That is why in some people's tongue, Krishna Nama does not come because of their offense. So here we are chanting in service of the Nama and Krishna is also sounding. Krishna sounding and Krishna is no different. So we have to always have minimum Shraddha that this is Krishna himself. Roopa Krishna is Purna Krishna. Commonly we understand, okay, okay, okay, now only sound has come. But I saw Krishna. That you feel more complete. This is our conditioning. As much Purna the Roopa Krishna is, that much Purna is Shabda Krishna. We are, we are invoking Shabda Krishna. We are associating with Shabda Krishna. It's Krishna himself. So fortunate. Because if you have that Shraddha, then automatically you will be jubilant in hearing, in jubilant in embracing each sound. You will be delightfully chanting, oh my god, just chanting means Krishna is appearing on my tongue. How much delightful I should be. So one should delightfully chant, joyfully hear. When you realize that Krishna has come on my tongue, on my tongue, my god, himself has come on my tongue to give me association.

**Key Quote:** "Doing japa is not only I am chanting, Lord himself is, he is sounding that."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that doing japa is not only chanting but also the Lord sounding the holy name, leading to feelings of priti (love), and that Krishna receives the seva (service) offered through Shakti Avesha Nama as if it were offered directly to Him.

Automatically you will feel his priti. I am such a insignificant soul. I have got this chance to do japa. As I said, doing japa is not only I am chanting, Lord himself is, he is sounding that. Sound that we chant and the nama from the Lord, he enters, Avesha. What enters? The transcendental sound enters. Just like in a marble deity or something. Marble deity is made of matter. But, Sachidananda Lord enters. So similarly, the Lord enters in the shabda that we make, that we chant and then it becomes transcendental sound. Shakti Avesha Nama. Shakti Avesha Nama is what we and Krishna says, Krishna, the principle is that, if Shuddha Nama had come before you, if you chant and serve, you glorify by singing Hare Krishna, Krishna Nama, Shuddha Nama. How he receives your seva, the same way Krishna is receiving exactly just by Shakti Avesha Nama, by serving the sound that you hear audibly with your ears. Krishna gives you the credit for chanting and hearing his Shuddha Nama. Just like how Krishna, you offer a garland to the deity. You are offering the garland to the deity, but the Sachidananda, it is as good as, because Krishna has decided, I will become this.

**Key Quote:** "This is Krishna's sound body, Shabdavatara, sound body."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the need for faith that the sound of the holy name is Chinmaya (spiritual), Krishna's sound body, and that one should approach chanting with seriousness, recognizing its importance.

That faith is required. I offer garland to the visible deity, the deity visible with my eyes. And what is Krishna's promise? I will take that as you are offering to me, Sachidananda in the spiritual world. That is where faith is required, that this is not just the ordinary sound that I am hearing with my ears, but it is a Chinmaya sound. The spirit part of it you don't see, but you will start experiencing. Just like I see your body, but I don't see a spirit. But I still see though, this is, there is a person in this body. And this is Krishna's sound body, Shabdavatara, sound body. In that sound body, Krishna's transcendental sound is a transcendental soul in the sound. So, rapid progress you make in realizing Krishna consciousness, different aspects of Krishna consciousness, if you start with serious mindful japa, and then gradually it will awaken our and plus when you are reading Prabhupada's book, all those things, then in soulful japa, you can start doing soulful japa. Now itself, because we are devotees of the Lord, so much of Prabhupada's books we have studied, it's not that now we can only do mindful japa, we can also do soulful japa immediately. The feeling of surrender, all those things is already there. On each bead, the Lord is appearing. On each bead, each bead of Saiva is most important. One should think that it is the most important thing you can do in your life, is to add one more chanting and hearing to the history, to your history. That kind of seriousness should be there.

All kinds of mercy Nama Prabhu can give. Nama Prabhu can give us detachment from this stupid illusory love, illusory pleasures. He can give Divya Gyan, Nama Prabhu.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the transcendental form of the Lord, emphasizing that although the Lord has unlimited forms, they are all identical and simultaneously existing.

So in the purport of Rampal, he is describing something about each of these personal attributes of the Lord. In this paragraph that I just now read, he is discussing or describing the transcendental form of the bodies of the Lord. He is an unlimited person, so he has unlimited forms. But all the forms are identical with one another. This is difficult for us to conceive, that there is one person with many forms, all simultaneously existing and all identical with each other. The same person, but he is present as Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Krishna, Matsya.

All identical, one Supreme Lord, but he is present in many different forms. This is actually an opulence of the Lord, that you cannot limit him to just one form. Neither he becomes split personality when he expands or when he is present in many forms. He is still the same person, still the same Supreme Lord. His qualities or his activities or his powers do not reduce when he expands, when he is present in many forms. And these forms are not temporary forms, they are all eternal forms.

**Key Quote:** "So what we should do is, we should simply hear on the authority of the Sriman Bhagavatam, on the authority of the great devotees, on the authority of the Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, to simply hear."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of hearing from authoritative sources to understand the transcendental form of God, using the example of Brahma doubting Krishna's form as a cowherd boy.

So we cannot understand, in our present condition, what is the actual nature of this form of God. So what we should do is, we should simply hear on the authority of the Sriman Bhagavatam, on the authority of the great devotees, on the authority of the Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, to simply hear. And while hearing, we try to keep aside all our material conceptions. Material conceptions of the form means, a form is a limitation. Transcendental form means there is no limitation. Transcendental form is the body. There is no limitation. So the form actually has got unlimited power, unlimited varieties, unlimited love, unlimited qualities. But still, the form is something which, when it is revealed, it becomes known to the devotee and it may appear like an ordinary form. Just like the form of Krishna. Now Krishna appears in Vrindavan like a cowherd boy. So, people may think, is this a form of God? Cowherd boy? Even big big devatas, including Brahma, they will doubt whether this is the form of God or it is the form of somebody else.

So Brahma knew that actually that form of Krishna as cowherd boy is actually God's form. But still he wanted to test. So he performed one trick. He used his mystic power. Brahma's mystic power is among the greatest in this material world. So Brahma used his mystic power. What is the power of Brahma's mystic power? Any example you can think of? Brahma demonstrates his mystic power sometimes. No example you can think of. Of course, while testing Krishna, he used his mystic power. That you all know. But any other example? When Hiranyakashipu was doing tapasya, what did Brahma come and do? He sprinkled some water. Hiranyakashipu's body was eaten away by ants. It was reduced to bones. The skin, the flesh, everything was finished. Just he sprinkled some water and Hiranyakashipu's body became fully reconstructed. Full luster. So that is Brahma's mystic power. That is Brahma's mystic power. So Brahma gave Hiranyakashipu the boon that you will not die in the day or night. You cannot be killed by human. You cannot be killed by devata. You cannot be killed by asura. You cannot be killed by any insect or reptile or animal. So Hiranyakashipu became very, very, very, very powerful. So that is Brahma's mystic power. That is Brahma's mystic power. He is very, very powerful.

**Key Quote:** "Brahma came a second time and took away the covered boys."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Brahma using his mystic power to steal the calves and cowherd boys while Krishna is having lunch, and Krishna's seemingly nonchalant response.

That Brahma is trying to see who is his covered body. Trying to test who is his covered body. So what did he do? What did Brahma do to test Krishna? First he took away the karmas, which Krishna had brought for grazing. Along with the karmas he also brought karmas for grazing. And they were a big number. They were not small numbers. Very big number. Number is not mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. They were a very big number. In Jetani Jetanatha I have made an idea of number. I will tell that later. So Brahma used his mystic power. And while Krishna was enjoying his lunch with the other covered boys, that time Brahma took away the karmas. He stole them. And suddenly one of the covered boys is seeing, Oh, the karmas are not there. Where has it gone? Not even one is visible. So they all started dying. So Krishna knows what is happening. But just to play along with Brahma, Krishna said, told the covered boys, Don't worry. You continue eating your lunch. I will just go look around and bring them back. They just strayed away. This is gone away. Looking for some fresh grass here and there. This is gone away. So Krishna went away, apparently in searching the karmas. Meantime, when Krishna had gone away, Brahma came a second time and took away the covered boys. What did Brahma do? He put those karmas into a sleeping condition and took them away. Next he put the boys into a sleeping condition and took them away. And he is hiding them and coming back and seeing what is happening.

### Brahma's mystic power, Krishna's unlimited power, comparison with yogi's power

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So you can imagine how powerful is Brahma."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Brahma's mystic power with the limited power of a yogi, highlighting that a yogi's expanded forms act in unison, unlike Krishna's independent forms.

So you can imagine how powerful is Brahma. Brahma's mystic power. So powerful. He can put them to sleep and hide them and touch a big number. Never a very big number. Not a small number. He is coming back and seeing all the covered boys and the karmas are as they are in Krishna. So Brahma is giving them away. He is using his mystic power to test Krishna. Brahma is giving them away. And he is trying to see whether the covered boys and karmas are the same or they are different. And Brahma is seeing they are the same, identical. So then he thought for a moment that Krishna has somehow done some other used some other mystic power and brought them back from where Brahma had hidden them. But actually Brahma could see that there are two sets. Not one set. Two sets of covered boys and karmas. All identical. So he has hidden them. They are there. And here Krishna is also hiding. So how is this possible? Brahma is thinking how is it possible? And not only that because a yogi can expand himself into some other forms up to nine or ten forms. And all forms will look identical to the yogi. But the yogi's mystic power is such that if in one form he lifts his hand all the nine forms the hand will lift it. It's like television screen. There are multiple screens. In the studio like telecast is going on in the studio one actor's person is lifting the hand. In the television screen same action will happen. Correct? All the television screens same action will happen. No independence. Similarly yogi when he expands all the forms will be doing the same action. These are the children they call for independence they march the drill. Everybody will do like this. Like this. Like this. The drill master will keep like this. One, two, three, four. Something like this. They all lift their hands. Correct? Identically. Looks very nice. So like that a yogi cannot independently do different things in different forms.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna when he expands his forms need not look identical... And each form can act independently."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's forms can be different and act independently, unlike a yogi's, leading Brahma to realize Krishna's true nature as Yogeshwara.

Not possible. Krishna when he expands his forms need not look identical. His forms can look all different. And each form can act independently. So the cowherd boys are playing with Krishna. The cows are there grazing on the field in the forest and they are all independently doing their own thing. Not all are same action. No. So they are Brahma realists. No. This is not the power of a yogi that this cowherd boy is displaying. He is actually my master. Yogeshwara Krishna. He is Yogeshwara Krishna master. So he is able to display this power which is not possible for any yogi. It's not possible even for me. So he is Krishna. He is God. So Brahma would understand that here is God after testing using his own instinct. So that's the nature of Krishna's form. He can expand and each form can be different and each form can act independently and all forms are actually Krishna only. Now to prove to Brahma that these are forms of Krishna's own forms what happened? After some time Brahma was watching. Krishna turned into four handed Narayana form. All the cowherd boys and calves became four handed Narayana form. And that is when Brahma got the confirmation Oh! Krishna has expanded. While I am hiding the cowherd boys and calves in my place Krishna has expanded. So from this we can understand Krishna's form.

What is Krishna's form? Some idea we can get. Even when Krishna showed universal form to Arjuna Bhagavad Gita has a description. You should read that description. The whole universe entire universe is actually one of the forms of Krishna. One of the forms of Krishna whole universe itself. So that form Arjuna could see sitting in one place because the universe is so big. How can you see the whole universe sitting in one place? Sitting on the chariot Arjuna was able to see the universal form of Krishna. So for that Krishna had given special vision and Krishna helped Arjuna to see that form. Arjuna could see that universal form. Then Krishna showed Arjuna that universal form transformed into four handed form. Dharayana form. Then again that four handed form transformed into Krishna's own form two handed form. So all these forms Arjuna was able to see because Krishna has unlimited forms and he is the same person and all these forms are Krishna's forms only. All these forms are Krishna's forms only. Now when somebody sees the form of Krishna generally a person who sees the form of Krishna thinks that this form is an unlimited form. Just like when Krishna was present 5000 years ago. Like Brahma thought he is an ordinary cardboard boy. Not only Brahma practically everybody used to take that form of Krishna as an ordinary form. Very few people knew that this form of Krishna is actually the form of God or Krishna is God.

**Key Quote:** "When Vishnu or Krishna out of their mercy they reveal to Brahma they reveal to a devotee they give the realization about the transcendental nature of Brahma."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that realizing Krishna's transcendental form requires devotion and Krishna's mercy, emphasizing the importance of a personal relationship.

Very few people knew that. Most people did not know that. So even if you see Krishna's form even if you see God's form you will see the way you are seeing here of Krishna and Dharna. Being a Krishna and Dharna what do people think? Statue made of metal. They think it is a statue made of metal and devotees have never heard of it. The statue. But this is not a statue. It is actually Sakshat Bhagwan Krishna. Now how can we understand how can we realize this form actually is not a statue. The same way how Brahma can realize the form of Krishna or Krishna. It is not an ordinary form. How Brahma can realize? When Krishna gives the realization out of Krishna's own mercy. When Vishnu or Krishna out of their mercy they reveal to Brahma they reveal to a devotee they give the realization about the transcendental nature of Brahma. Then only it is possible otherwise not possible. So if you also want to see Krishna or you want to realize this form as spiritual form you should actually become a devotee. You should practice Bhakti and that Bhakti should be such that you should please Krishna by your devotion. There is a certain amount of personal relationship involved in this. Personal relationship.

**Key Quote:** "It is love."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a mother's love for her child to illustrate the selfless devotion a devotee has for Krishna, emphasizing the reciprocal relationship.

It is like in ordinary beings also we try to please a person. Especially mother tries to please the child or husband tries to please the wife. Right? It is more than just simply some activity or some relationship. It is more than that. So what is that special thing about trying to please another person? It is love. That is what we call love. So if there is love a loving relationship in which one is trying to please the other then there is possibility that the other person will reciprocate. And in that reciprocation there is no consideration of who is greater who is smaller who is demanding what. There is no such consideration. There is no calculation being done. There is no mother loves her child. The mother will take care of the child. The child will pass through a neuron. The mother will not think why I should clean? Stupid child. There is no business. Whole day only eating, sleeping, passing urine, passing stool. That's all. What does the child do whole day? Especially small child. Put him there. What does he do? Only do this business. Mother keeps on. Never counts how many times I have done. How long I have to do this. Mother never thinks. So, like that Prabhupada explains when a devotee develops love for Krishna in a loving relationship devotee is prepared to do anything for Krishna in order to please Krishna. And Krishna reciprocally is ready to do anything for a devotee to please the devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that realizing Krishna's transcendental nature requires establishing a loving relationship and pleasing Him, referencing Brahma's tapasya and the importance of the parampara system.

That is Krishna. So, if you want actually to realize Krishna's transcendental form or His qualities or His color or His activities anything about Krishna about Krishna about the transcendental personality of Godhead then you have to establish a relationship that is called madhi and in that relationship you should try to please Him. Now, Brahma has pleased Vishnu by performing tapasya. He has pleased Vishnu by performing tapasya. That direction for doing tapasya was given by Vishnu himself. The beginning Brahma did not know who He is where has He come from what is the purpose of His existence He didn't know anything. So, He was directed by Vishnu to perform His tapasya and He did that tapasya very very very long time very severe and then when Vishnu was pleased then Vishnu gave Him the realization and Brahma became realized and Brahma became realized so that knowledge Brahma got the realization by the mercy of Vishnu after Brahma performed tapasya then Brahma actually got the power the knowledge the skill yana bala priya everything to create this whole universe and Brahma also got the knowledge Brahma also after creating He handed down that knowledge that is called parampara system of receiving this transcendental knowledge especially this knowledge about the personality of God especially this knowledge also the other knowledge all other knowledge but especially this transcendental and for receiving the personality of Godhead there is no other way other than receiving this knowledge in parampara system.

And after receiving this knowledge to realize this knowledge you have to follow the same technique or process Brahma what did Brahma do he tried to please Vishnu by following Vishnu's directions instructions so similarly we should first receive this knowledge and that's what all of you are doing now you are hearing you are receiving the knowledge this is parampara Shukadeva Goswami is describing he heard from Vyasa Vyasa is describing he heard from Narada Narada is describing the knowledge of Vishnu he got a direct realization through mechanical reality he heard from Vishnu where is hearing he directly got the realization what does it once say power of me namely my form my existence my color my qualities my activities that all Brahma Brahma did not first hear then I had to sit down to tapasya then after that after tapasya Vishnu would be pleased then Vishnu would give me realization no before tapasya Brahma did not know anything there was nobody to explain to him there is it is different from material form now you are all hearing like that Brahma never got a chance to hear like that directly Vishnu gave him realization so hearing and realization simultaneously happened Vishnu is speaking Brahma is hearing ok but realization is simultaneous with the hearing here is one secret you may get this knowledge by hearing or by studying and then follow a process of bhakti and then after many many many years you can get realization when Vishnu is speaking or Krishna is speaking there is another secret that simultaneously with hearing you can also get realization without following the process of tapasya and Brahma did.

Provided you are hearing these is with bhakti if you are hearing is with faith is with devotion is with bhakti devotional hearing then the realization will come along with the process separately you don't have to do anything so the bhagavata process is particularly this process of realization simply by hearing but there is a technique of hearing this hearing is not like ordinary hearing ordinary hearing work is what when you hear some information is there that information you receive and then you try to conceive that in your mind or think about it or conceptualize it understand it and then you try to put it into practice you follow some process some instruction you may have doubts you may have difficulties you may have obstacles and then you have to do so many things isn't it but that is not a process that bhagavata is actually teaching Parikshit Maharaj what did he do simply he sat and heard Shukadeva Goswami he realized Shukadeva Goswami what did he do simply he sat and heard from Vyasa Deva he realized Shukadeva Goswami what did he do he simply sat and heard from Shukadeva Goswami he realized so bhagavata process is different bhagavata process is different because in this way very quickly you can actually realize bhagavata very very quickly Shukadeva Goswami says one moment is enough one moment is enough if you follow this process of bhagavata process it is called bhagavata dharma Prahlad Maharaj described this process as bhagavata dharma right he described this in the seventh canto Shravanam Kirtanam Vishno Smaranam Pada Sevanam Archanam Vandanam Dasyam Sakhyam Atma Nivedanam this is called bhagavata dharma.

Who is famous for having realized Krishna by remembering? Prahlad Maharaj, simply by remembering he realized God. Then, serving the Lotus Feet, Lakshmi. Lakshmi is always engaged in serving the Lotus Feet of the Supreme God. But her realization of God came about by the same method, same process. Simply by...

**Summary:** The speaker continues with examples of devotees who realized God through different processes of devotional service, highlighting Hanuman's service and emphasizing that hearing is the easiest process as it requires no qualification.

Then, Shravanam Keetanam, Vandanaam. Vandanaam means offering prayers. Who realized God by offering prayers? Akruda. Simply he offered prayers to Krishna. And he realized Krishna. Dasyam. Dasyam. Hanuman. Simply by acting as the Lord's servant. Lord Ram is known as servant. There are so many Masters who are servants. But that type of servant is not going to help you. Because they are not rendering service. They are not rendering service with devotion. In this world, so many Masters and so many servants. Some of them say, oh, very faithful servant. But still, it is not having devotion. So with devotion, how to serve? As a servant of the Lord, of Krishna, the Supreme Lord. That you have to learn from Hanuman. How to hear? You have to learn from Parishad. How to serve the lotus feet? You have to learn from Prajnini. So like this, Bhagavatam process especially is expressed in the Bhagavatam. You should hear the devotion. All the things here is the easiest. Other things are not so easy. Remembering, serving the lotus feet, acting as the servant of the Lord like Hanuman did. All that, not easy. Hearing is the easiest. It doesn't require any qualification.

**Key Quote:** "The special thing about hearing is, it doesn't require any qualification."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that hearing requires no qualification and shares an anecdote about Prabhupada reciting the tenth canto of Bhagavatam, emphasizing the spiritual benefit of hearing even without understanding.

The special thing about hearing is, it doesn't require any qualification. Will I read? Anything else requires qualification. You have to speak, or you have to serve the lotus feet, or you have to remember. It requires qualification. Whereas hearing is the only thing among the nine processes that does not require any qualification. But there is a quality to the hearing. The technique of hearing. And for that Bhagavatam says, even the technique of hearing, you develop by hearing only. Simply sit and hear, that's all. In the early days, Prabhupada was travelling. You forgot to put in the belt. Okay, two hours. I'll come close with this example. Prabhupada was travelling with some disciples. And it was Janmashtami. Early days. They were not observing him. Because the temple had not yet been started. So Prabhupada told the disciples, some few devotees, You simply hear, I will recite the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam, which describes specially the birth of Krishna. Because today is the Janmashtami, the birthday of Krishna, appearance and worship. So they were all hearing. They can't understand anything. Prabhupada is reading his answer. Prabhupada said, whether you understand or don't understand, simply by hearing, you get full spiritual benefit. You get full spiritual benefit. So, hearing doesn't require any qualification. You simply have to lend your ear. That's all. And whether you understand or don't understand, the spiritual benefit is there. And, in the beginning, maybe you don't understand. But as you go on hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, everything will be understood. Everything will be revealed. Everything will be realized. It's just a question of time.

### warning against speculation, spiritual complexion, hearing without conception, realization through hearing

**Key Quote:** "When you hear, don't speculate."
**Summary:** The speaker warns against speculation and material conceptions while hearing, emphasizing the importance of hearing without trying to conceive or compare, to facilitate realization.

Keep hearing. But, there is a warning given in the Bhagavatam. When you hear, don't speculate. Don't try to conceive within your material mind what is being described. Just like if it is described, Krishna is black complexion, dark complexion. Immediately, material world conception of dark is not beautiful. Material world, somebody's dark complexion, we say, generally, not beautiful. But, spiritual conception of beauty is different. It is not dependent on the color of the skin or the complexion of the body. As Prabhupada says here, some of the forms are blackish, some are whitish, some are reddish, some are yellowish. All of them are beautiful. All of them are supremely beautiful. So, that is spiritual complexion. It has no relationship with beauty. Immediately, certain complexion is same. Beautiful certain complexion is same, not beautiful. Spiritually, there is no such thing as not beautiful. All spiritual forms are beautiful. All spiritual forms are beautiful. Though there are different complexions. So, you should not speculate about the spiritual subject matter or what is being described. Simply hear as it is. And try to perceive this knowledge or hear without trying to conceive, without trying to speculate, without trying to guess, without trying to think what it could be like that we imagine. Don't hear. Don't speculate. Don't theorize. Don't compare. You can think materially. Now, the moment you hear something, you compare materially what it could be. All it will be experienced. So, this sort of hearing will actually help you to realize. So, let's stop here.

### miseries of life, detachment, old age, spiritual reflection

**Key Quote:** "So these are inescapable realities of life and so it's important that we reflect on it as spiritualists."
**Summary:** Lord Kapila's instructions to his mother focus on the miseries of old age, birth, and death, emphasizing the importance of reflecting on these realities as spiritualists.

knowing that is considered to be a glorious death, but an attached family man wants his family members to carry him in a great procession even after his death, and although he will not be able to see how the procession goes, he still desires that his body be taken gorgeously in procession. Thus, he is happy without even knowing where he has to go when he leaves his body for the next life. So we are seeing in this chapter Lord Kapila's instructions to his mother, and particularly in great detail we are hearing about the miseries of old age. Generally, we know birth, death, old age, and disease are the miseries, but here in this chapter of the Bhagavatam, in this section of the Bhagavatam, the miseries of old age are being more explicitly, more clearly described so that we as human beings can reflect on this and can derive great lessons from this. Similarly, there are other parts of the Bhagavatam which describe the miseries of birth, and there are other sections which talk about the miseries of death. So these are inescapable realities of life, and so it's important that we reflect on it as spiritualists, and in today's verse, Lord Kapila is saying.

**Key Quote:** "It is that strong sense of attraction I want to go back I'll be I'll going back to the Association of that my family my beloved that actually drowns away the miseries."
**Summary:** An analogy of a man returning to his family or a boy meeting his girlfriend illustrates how strong attraction can overshadow life's miseries, mirroring the attraction devotees should cultivate for Krishna.

and it's a two-day journey, and when he is coming back, the two-day journey in the train, maybe he didn't get the right seat, dirty train, all dirty people around or whatever, didn't get good food. But Prabhupada explains the thought of the joy of being united with the family is so strong that he is just thinking, "When am I going to be with my family members?" And he's so eager to be back with the family, and that joy fills those two days of his journey, and the miseries he goes through are actually not at all disturbing him. Recently, I was preaching to somebody, and I gave this example to them, and then I gave a little twist to it to make it even more, you know, for people to understand a little bit strongly. I said, "Imagine here is a boy, young boy, and after a long time he's coming back and he's going to meet his girlfriend or something whom he loves so much, and two days of journey he's absorbed in, 'When I'm going to be with her?'" And so the difficulties that he goes through in the two days, he just doesn't bother at all. When I told this to this man, he's a respected man, he immediately, about 50 year old man, he said, "Yes, yes, Swamiji, I can understand what you are saying. About 30 years back," and he started recalling, "I had to travel from Dehradun to Patna, and there was no train, and three days I had to go and then I was meeting," and she pointed to his wife who was there sitting next to him, and I was saying, "Stop, you guy." Everybody indicated that he had more questions about what you are saying about happening. I'm not a university student in Delhi days. I had to go and then I was meeting, and she pointed to his wife who was there sitting next to him, and I was engaged to her. I was going to meet her, meet my fiance, and with great difficulty I went this way, that way, bus and car train and unreserved, but I was so, I didn't bother at all. I was going to meet like that. So actually, this example of a man returning to the family or a young boy absorbed in the thought of meeting his girlfriend and wanting to be with her, this example that Sheila Prabhupada gives has one very important element in this, that is a sense of very strong attraction for the family or for the beloved. It is that strong sense of attraction, "I want to go back, I'll be, I'll going back to the association of that, my family, my beloved," that actually drowns away the miseries of the journey. The same way, Krishna deity is teaching us that our lives' miseries will become facial makeup, drowned and become insignificant, provided we have developed that kind of attraction for Krishna. I'm ready enough feeling of growing homes in the village of 17 idea Schönfeldgel beonden.

**Key Quote:** "The most important principle of the material world is the attraction between man and woman and the most important principle or the dominant principle in the spiritual world is attraction between the living entity and Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material and spiritual attraction, stating that while attraction between man and woman drives the material world, attraction to Krishna is the dominant force in the spiritual world, making life interesting and dynamic.

me one day and he said, "Swamiji, we are opening a new house and my wife is saying that we should call you to come and do a pooja." I said, "Okay." And his wife, I could hear over here, his wife also speaking behind him, and then, "Swamiji, my wife is asking how long the pooja will be?" So I said, "Maybe one hour," I said. Then he immediately said, "Swamiji, one hour, that's too long, can you make it short?" I said, "Okay, we can make it short, shall we make it half an hour?" "No, no, no, Swamiji, even half an hour is too long, can you make it 15 minutes?" I said, "Finally, okay, 15 minutes." Soon after the call, he said, "Swamiji, I'll talk to you, I'll talk to you later on. Now there's India Pakistan cricket is going on match, I'll talk more details later on, Swamiji," and put the phone down. So see the contrast here, when it comes to a spiritual or a religious program, there's no attraction at all. He wants it to be as short as possible, one hour, my God, make it as short as possible, and the attraction is for some cricket match that's going on and see that. So it's the attraction that drives a person. There is one great statement that Sheila Prabhupada makes in a letter to one devotee. Prabhupada says, "The most important principle of the material world is the attraction between man and woman, and the most important principle or the dominant principle in the spiritual world is attraction between the living entity and Krishna." What is special about this statement of Sheila Prabhupada is actually what makes life interesting is that attraction. If there is no attraction, life becomes dull. So Prabhupada's teaching, Vedic literatures are offering, there is a life of attraction in the spiritual world between the living entity and Krishna. The attraction between a man and a woman in the material world is contrived, is वीट नहीं है , रूल रु कोट या वड़करण और अयस्कमोयों का बूर्ण के समय । यदि ये ये तो कर्मिल में एकलोरिसम है, तो ये अवश्य हो रहा है। ये खरल को रख भूलेगर वाले है, माया पर प्रतीश रूकेते हैं। ये खरल को रख भूलेगर है. Whereas in the spiritual world, the dominant force that is acting everywhere in the spiritual world is dynamic, moment to moment attraction between the living entities and the Lord. The living entities want to serve the Lord and please him, and the Lord wanting to serve the devotees and please them. Gopi jana vallabha giri varadhari Krishna is also thinking, "How I can please the gopis? How can I can please Mother Yashoda?" So the element of attraction, which is actually the spice of life, which is actually what makes life interesting, is not absent in the spiritual world.

**Summary:** Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings emphasize that spiritual life is not merely mechanical rituals but a process of purifying the heart to awaken the soul's original attraction to Krishna, which is facilitated by faith in Vaishnavas.

So in Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu points out that the Vedic processes that are mentioned are, it's called the sadhana, sadhana bhakti, vaidhi bhakti, according to the regulative principles given in the Vedic literature, that when we do that, we, our heart gets purified and that original attraction the site soul has for Krishna is awaken, then the spiritual life looks completely different. This is a very, very special hope and revelation of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as it is there in the Vedic literature. So big control over spirituality, spiritual life is not just mechanical, repetitive, not just mechanical, repetitive, mindless rituals and you go on doing that. No. It is meant, it is required, that is very essential to control the senses, to purify the senses, to purify the consciousness. But when we do that, by the mercy of Guru and Krishna, that attraction to Krishna is awakened. That is the special thing of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, it is there in the Vedic literatures but even the previous Acharyas had not as clearly pointed out, revealed as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu reveals and it is said Chaitanya Charitamruta reveals that there are certain things which are very beneficial to awaken that attraction and one important principle that is very essential to awaken that attraction is faith in the Vaishnavas because that has to be given by a Vaishnava. We cannot acquire it and achieve it. We cannot acquire it and achieve it. We cannot acquire it and achieve it by our efforts. Our efforts are a qualification to receive, but you have to receive it. If it is not given, you cannot do anything about it. You have to wait and try to please a Vaishnava.

**Summary:** The story of Kalidas, a devotee with immense faith in Vaishnavas, illustrates his practices of honoring Vaishnava remnants (Uchishta) and dust from their feet (Paada Dhooli) to awaken love for Krishna.

faith, strong faith in the Vaishnava. To illustrate this, Chaitanya Charitamruta is a, is a great devotee, his name was Kalidas. Actually, he was an elderly devotee, he was the uncle of Raghunath Das Goswami, and it is said that always he would be chanting Krishna's name, even while doing ordinary work, doing different things, he would always be chanting Krishna's name. He would always be chanting Krishna's name. Another characteristic of this devotee Kalidas was he had great faith in the Vaishnavas, and so what he would do, he would take all kinds of eatables, gifts and go and give it to a Vaishnava, and then after the Vaishnava accepts it, he would induce him, "Please take it away from him, please eat it, honor it," and he would make him, after that with folded hands he would request him, "Can I get some remnants of the Prasadam of what you have eaten?" Chaitanya Charitamruta describes food offered to Krishna, it becomes Mahaprasadam, and when that Mahaprasadam is eaten by a devotee, Vaishnava, pure devotee, and the remnants of that are known as Maha Maha Prasadam. So he would go to a devotee, give him all kinds of food and then request him, "Please give me Maha Maha Prasadam of yours," and sometimes devotees are generally very, very humble, they would say, "No, no, no, we cannot give you, we cannot, please, thank you very much," and would send him away. But he would go out and he would wait and hide. After some time when they come and throw the food something from their house, he would immediately go there, take that one and lick that, so much faith in the Vaishnava and so much faith in the principle of Vaishnava Uchishta. This is called Vaishnava Uchishta, left remnants of what is left over by a pure devotee. So he would do that and then sometimes he would go to another thing this Kalidas would do, he would go to a devotee's house, give them gifts and all that, and then when he is, when they are sending him off, he would make the devotee walk a little distance and then he would send him back. While he is walking, he would keep track of the steps and sometimes an impression is made, and then after this person is gone, he would go there, take the dust from the footmarks and apply it on his head, on his body, Vaishnava Paada Dhooli, Bhakta Paada Dhooli. So he had immense faith in this and he would always do that.

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu had made a rule, "No one should touch the water that has washed my feet," and Govinda, his assistant, Chaitanya used to have an assistant by name Govinda, he used to keep an eye on that one because it was Mahaprabhu's order. So one day when Kalidas came, he was waiting there, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Paada Jala was so special. So Govinda was pouring water, in a flick of a moment he put his hand there and he drank it three times, and then Chaitanya Mahaprabhu saw, "Enough, stop that, go away," Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, "Thank you," and then he went away, but he managed to sip three times Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Paada Jala. So Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami explains that Bhakta Paada Dhooli, Bhakta Paada Jala, Bhakta Bhukta Avashesha Ina Mahabhala, these three things are considered to be very powerful to awaken that love of Krishna, that attraction to Krishna. Paada Dhooli, the dust from the lotus feet of a devotee, Paada Jala, water that has washed the lotus feet of a devotee, and Bhakta Bhukta Avashesha what? the remnants of the food that a devotee has eaten.

**Key Quote:** "That's the good nature of a woman always they want they are always ready eager to do service."
**Summary:** A story about a stewardess on a flight with Srila Prabhupada eating Maha Maha Prasadam and then offering service illustrates the power of Prasadam and the natural inclination of women to serve.

There is one very interesting pastime in Srila Prabhupada's life. Once Prabhupada was travelling from, in a flight from Mexico City to Caracas, that's in South America, capital of Venezuela. So Prabhupada was travelling and Prabhupada was sitting at the window seat, next to him was his servant, and next to him was another, his secretary. His servant was Shrutakirti, next to him was Paramahamsa Swami, a sanyasi, his secretary. Actually, whenever Prabhupada travelled, they would pack some Prasadam, and Prabhupada was very, very fond of Krishna Prasadam. Always he would insist Prasabhadam is carried even if it's a short flight or a long flight, always devotees would carry Prasadam and Prabhupada would have at different times. So here in Mexico City temple they had made puffed rice, Muri, puffed rice and fried with turmeric and seasoning and nice salt. That was one of the favourite dishes of Prabhupada. Prabhupada used to like that very much. So the devotees had made that very nicely, and then after the flight took off, his servant pulled out from the bag, there was an aluminium foil, he opened it and kept it before Prabhupada, and then Prabhupada ate a few times and then he gave it. So Prabhupada would eat little and then he would give it to the servant, and then Shrutakirti accepted that, he divided that, made it into two and he gave one to Paramahamsa and he was eating. So very happy, Prabhupada's Mahamahaprasadam, they were happy. Just then the steward in the aircraft, it was Venezuela Airlines, so a young woman walked by and she stood next to Paramahamsa and she was staring at what they are eating, some very strange yellow puffed rice for her it was, and very strangely she put her hand into the little plate of Shrutakirti, took a little, put it in her mouth and looked at them and said, "Very tasty," and he was shocked and suddenly some hand coming and he was just recovering and then she said, "What is this?" He didn't know, he said, "You know, we are vegetarians and we eat some of these." "Oh, you are vegetarians, very nice, do you want something more?" And so he asked Prabhupada, "You want something she is asking?" And so Prabhupada said, "Fruits." "Oh yes, I will get you some fruits," she said. And then again she asked, "Do you want anything to drink?" And then he asked Prabhupada, she said, "Prabhupada, she is asking, do you want to drink anything?" And said Prabhupada said, "Hot milk." Prabhupada liked hot milk also and so she said, "Yes, you can give hot milk," and she said, "Okay, if there is anything more also I will get for you," and she went away. So Shrutakirti turned to Prabhupada and said, "Prabhupada, look at this, what a miracle, how she got, how she got maha maha prasadam." I mean he was trying to say that Prabhupada said, "That's the good nature of a woman, always they want, they are always ready, eager to do service." Actually, he was telling about maha maha prasadam, but then Prabhupada was looking at her willingness to bring some fruits and milk and all of those wanting to do. So Prabhupada appreciated her and then she went away and they brought the fruits.

### Maha Maha Prasadam, devotee, Krishna consciousness, faith, attraction to Krishna

**Key Quote:** "This is the potency of Maha Maha Prasadam of a Vaishnava of a pure devotee."
**Summary:** The story of the stewardess becoming a devotee years later after eating Maha Maha Prasadam highlights the potency of Prasadam and the importance of faith in Vaishnavas to awaken attraction to Krishna, ultimately drowning out life's miseries.

Then much, much 20 years later, Shrutakirti says he was describing this story in one Prabhupada festival in Los Angeles. So after the class one devotee walked up to him and said, "Prabhu, I want to tell you one story," and he said, "Yes, what is this story?" And then he described that how he was a South American devotee and how they would go from small town to town and they would do Harinam, they would do book distribution like that and would go house to house also and give some prasadam and books. So he said somewhere in Brazil, somewhere in a small town outside the town, this devotee and a few other devotees were going from house to house in a truck, in a jeep and showing books. So one house they knocked on and the door opened and there was a woman there and she saw, "Oh, Hare Krishna," very surprised in a place not expected and she said, "Please come in, please come in," and they walked into the house and they see in the house Prabhupada's picture, Krishna's picture like a devotee's house. So they asked her, "How did you come in touch with Krishna consciousness?" And she said, "You know, I met Srila Prabhupada." I said, "Oh, really, how was that?" And then she said, "I was working as a steward in Venezuela Airlines and once I got an opportunity to serve Prabhupada and I ate Maha Prasadam also, Maha Maha Prasadam and that's how it started and then I somehow came in touch with devotees and then and so on and on," and she has become a devotee. This is the potency of Maha Maha Prasadam of a Vaishnava, of a pure devotee. So these are all very, very special things about Krishna consciousness and Krishna Das Kaviraj Goswami says why it is said about these three Paada Jala, Bhakta Paada Jala, Bhakta Paada Dhooli, Bhakta Bhukta Avashesha, it is because the background is it is that enormous faith, that faith in the Vaishnava. Vaishnava is related to Krishna and Krishna has given him the powers to give that attraction to him. If he gives that attraction is awakened, that is an important principle. So if our lives, if the miseries of our life should become drowned and become insignificant, it is very important that that strong feeling for Krishna that is awakened in our heart and we should be begging to Srila Prabhupada, begging to Krishna, begging to the holy name to awaken that, that is an important gift of Chaitanya Maha Prabhu. When that happens, all these different kinds of miseries of old age, death, it will not bother us. Vimukto amrutam ashnute janmam rudyujara dukhair vimukto amrutam ashnute, one will be able to relish and taste transcendence. We will stop here. Grantharaj Srimad Bhagavatam ki.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the limitations of materialistic attempts to reach other planets and highlights the unrestricted movement of transcendentalists like Narada Muni and Durvasa Muni through devotional service and mystic powers.

can never move in such an unrestricted manner. The materialistic scientists' endeavor to reach other planets by mechanical vehicle is only a futile attempt. One can, however, reach heavenly planets by virtuous activities. But one can never expect to go beyond swarga or janaloka by such mechanical or materialistic activities, either gross or subtle. The transcendentalists, who have nothing to do with the gross material body, can move anywhere within or beyond the material worlds. Within the material worlds, they move in the planetary system of mahar, janas, tapa and satraloka. And beyond the material worlds, they can move in the vaikunthas as unrestricted spacemen. Narada Muni is one of the examples of such spacemen and Durvasa Muni is one such mystic. By the strength of devotional service, austerities, mystic powers and transcendental knowledge, everyone can move like Narada Muni or Durvasa Muni. It is said that Durvasa Muni traveled through the world, the entirety of material space and part of spiritual space, within one year only. The speed of the transcendentalists can never be attained by the gross or subtle materialists.

**Key Quote:** "This body is not suitable for any other place other than this planet."
**Summary:** This segment explains the process of knowing the Lord and transferring oneself to the original position, emphasizing that the current material body is specifically designed for Earth and unsuitable for other planets.

So understanding the Lord in the heart, chapter of Bhagavatam, step by step, the process of knowing the Lord and transferring one's attention, transferring oneself to his original position, is being explained here. So anybody who has the ability can transfer his body from this body, transfer his soul from this body to any other planet where he can get a suitable body. As we saw, the yogis, they can transfer themselves. Wherever you want to go, we could go. You want to go to sun planet, want to go to moon planet. Scientists and astronomers, they want to go to many planets in this lifetime. That becomes difficult. You can go to the other planets but you will have to give up this body. Scientists, astronomers, they want to go in this body. Actually they are not even going in this body. They have to cover this body with so many other things. In this body they can't go. They have to cover with so many things which is conducive to the atmosphere in that planet. They cannot expose their body. Wear a coat and suit and I am going to moon. I am going to mars. Not possible. You have to wear the appropriate dress. If you wear the appropriate dress then you could go. So actually they don't, they don't realize that this body is not suitable for any other place other than this planet because they don't know, because this body is made for this planet. This is earth. Earthly place. Earth, water, fire, all these things are present in this world.

### pancha bhutas, body composition, spiritual perception

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is foolish to go to these places because you are not supposed to be there."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the composition of the body based on the five elements (pancha bhutas) and argues that it's foolish to try to explore other planets with this body, as different planets require different types of bodies and senses to perceive their inhabitants.

And our body also consists of these things, because pancha bhutas, maha pancha maha bhutas, earth, water, fire, air, ether, these things are the coverings of this material world. These are the substance with which this world is made. So with these things being in the outer space, it is also present in our body in small, small proportion. So this planet which consists more of earth and water, our body is also more of earth and water. Majority of the body is water covered with fat, marrows and flesh and skin predominantly made of earth. Within this body there is this fire which helps us to sustain, create energy for movement, energy for digestion. Then this subtle energy, fire becomes, this fire becomes subtle energy in the form of all, all nervous systems, all electrical pulses around the body. As I say, we have, body's heart is pumping six liters of this blood in the body. So we don't buy a half HP pump and fit it inside and pump it, connect it to your plug point. Where is the plug point? Where is the power? Body is generating all those things. So body generates power just like a generator. So this is all made for this planet. Suppose you are in sun planet, this body will burn. But say you have a fire body, will you burn? You will not burn. Some other planet you have some other elements. So different planets are having different kinds of elements in different proportion and that suitable body you can be there. You go in this body and go to the, first of all you can go to sun. Say you are going to moon. They say they went to moon. Say you go to moon, now they want to go to mars. So they go to these places and look for, you know, who is there, hello, who is there. You can't see them nor can they hear you. But that doesn't mean there is nobody there. Right? Say you go to the world of ghost and knock and say hello. The ghost can see you. They will say hello. But you can't see them. You can't hear them. So it is foolish to go to these places.

### appropriate form, subtle existence, transcendental knowledge

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Just because we cannot see, we cannot perceive with the senses doesn't mean they don't exist."
**Summary:** This segment uses analogies of ocean life and sky to illustrate the need for an appropriate form to interact with different environments, emphasizing that the inability to perceive something with our senses doesn't negate its existence, which is a key understanding in transcendental knowledge.

Because you are not supposed to be there. Just like you can't go to the ocean and say hello to the dolphins and come. You need to have the appropriate clothing supporting your life. Then you can go there and play around. In the sky also you have something which keeps you floating. They can fly around and say hi to the birds, the geese are flying around. Same way you cannot go around the space and say oh Narada Muni is going there, Durvasa Muni is going there. Not possible. So we think these are all untrue. But if you sit back and think why not? Right? If the birds can fly, fishes can swim and I can't do that. There may be other living entities who can do something better than me. Something which I can't do. And maybe they can't do what I can do here. The people in Mars cannot come and say see the earthling. No they cannot. So even according to the material understanding looking at these millions and millions of stars it is foolish to think that we are the only people here. Because because Keetha explains spirit soul is sarvagataha, there is no place which is devoid of soul. Soul is everywhere. Even in this room we are only soul, 100 people or 50 people. No there are so many souls. There are so many ants here much more than us. There are so many bacteria here. There is coronavirus also around. Maybe millions of them. So if you say what is the strength of this room? He will say 60. No no no. There are millions and millions of people here in this lecture. So you can say that no no I was talking to millions of souls. Not to 50s. So there are many things in this room which we cannot see. And there are subtle bodies. Maybe some ghost also here in this. Fortunate ghost. Every ghost cannot hear Bhagavatam. Some fortunate ghost can hear. So living entities in subtle form are existing. So just because we cannot see, we cannot perceive with the senses doesn't mean they don't exist. That is the first understanding of a person who knows transcendental knowledge.

### yoga, transcendentalism, sense control

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So anybody who wants to transcend this material world."
**Summary:** This segment defines transcendentalists as those who seek to transcend the material world through practices like yoga and sense control, highlighting the need to free oneself from the limitations of the material world.

With that understanding we can see truth in what Bhagavatam and Shastras say. Shastras never tell untrue because they know more than us. So we are restricted. So the yogis try to free themselves from this restricted body and restricted mind. Because they know the soul is much much more powerful than this body and this mind. This subtle body. So they want to go away. Go above this material form. How? Through the process of yoga. The process of yoga involves sense control. They are all called transcendentalists. Whether you are a yogi or you are a jnani. Whether a monist or personalist or a Vaishnava. They are all called transcendentalists. Transcendentalist generally means anybody who wants to transcend this material world. Whoever wants to go above the material world. So if you want to go above the material world then you have to deny or you have to be free from the limitations of this world. Then only you can be a transcendentalist. As long as you are drowning in the water you cannot say that you are out of water. When you come out of water then you are out of water. So you need to deny the rules of water. Then you can get into the rules of earth, the shore. So as long as we don't deny the activities of the material world. What are the activities of the material world? Sensitification. Providing what the eyes want. Providing what the nose wants. Providing what the mouth wants. Tongue wants. The skin wants. So as long as we provide these things that the body wants we cannot be transcendentalist. Some people become out of body but they keep giving the materials required for the mind, for the intelligence, for the ego. They are also not transcendentalists because they are stuck with the subtle energies of this material world. Not only the gross energies of the material world but the subtle energies. So they are also called embodied. They are also called muk. They are not the bhadha jivas. But as long as you want to free yourself from this material, the requirements of the body then you are a transcendentalist. Even when you are trying, you are called a trying transcendentalist.

### bhakti, planetary systems, bodily requirements

**Key Quote:** "As soon as we deny the requirements of the body, we are transcendentalist."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the different planetary systems and emphasizes that even in this material world, liberation is possible by denying the requirements of the body, which is a prerequisite for going beyond the body and mind through devotional service or other spiritual processes.

So we are also transcendentalists. Trying transcendentalists. We are not following the yoga process or the jnana process. We are following bhakti. Bhakti process. Whichever the process is you are called transcendentalist. So these transcendentalists try to free themselves from these bodily limitations and rise above the body. Above this world, they go beyond this world, Svargaloka. Prabhupada says in this parbhud they cannot go beyond Svarga. Bhuvah, Svaha, Maha, Jnana, Tapa, Satya. These are the seven planetary systems above. Similarly seven below. So fourteen planetary systems. So up to Svarga you can go with material desires. Prabhupada says Jnana, which is part of Svarga. If you want to go to Maha, Tapa, Satya, you can go with the material desires. Prabhupada says Jnana, which is part of Svarga. If you want to go to Maha, Tapa, Satya, you cannot. So the people who are the souls who are in those planets are much much more advanced. Advanced in spiritual knowledge. Means they are free from the bodily bondages. They don't feel hungry like us. They don't feel the senses are just like us. But they are also in the material world. So half of the people in the material world are controllers of the body. But in this earth, you have two options. You can either be free from the bodily conditions or you can be within the bodily conditions. So you can be liberated in this material world, in this earth also. So as soon as we deny the requirements of the body, we are transcendentalist. And that is a prerequisite to go beyond this body and mind. Deny the requirements. So in devotional service or in yoga or any spiritual process, bodily requirements are limited.

### regulatory principles, karma, internal development

**Key Quote:** "If the same time is involved in internal development, then you can levitate."
**Summary:** This segment explains the importance of regulatory principles and sadhana in elevating the soul out of the body, using the examples of Narada Muni and Durvasa Muni, and comparing the effort spent on material advancements like space travel with the potential for internal development and spiritual progress.

So there is rules and regulations. Do this, don't do this. Regulatory principles. Follow these principles. Do this sadhana. These are all processes of elevating the soul out of this body. So Prabhupada gives two examples. Narada Mani or Durvasa Mani. Durvasa Mani also could travel. So people who are beyond this body, who are becoming beyond this body, they can start travelling everywhere. But you are restricted where you want to go. Just like in this world also, you want to go to the richest country. I want to be in the richest country in this world. Which is the richest country? Now? USA is gone. No more. Say some, I don't know, Denmark, Finland, they are rich. They won't allow you, unless you are also rich like them. First you have to show a balance sheet, your income tax, how much money you have, how much wealth you have, how good you are, what is your professional capacity, what are your abilities, can you contribute to the country, and then you come. So even in this material world, you cannot go to rich places. You want to go to Sudan? No problem. Because you are qualified to go there. Because people there are less qualified than you. But if you want to go to a place which is more qualified than you, conditions are there. So even in this world there are conditions. So if you have good karma, good money, good intelligence, then you are welcome to good places. Same way, if you have good karma, if you have controlled your body, you can go to a place better than this place. Svarga, you can enjoy so many things. Beyond Svarga, Chana, Tapa, Maharloka, Satyaloka, all are yogis. They can go anywhere. Just take off. Travel anywhere. They might be sitting and wondering what these people in earth are doing. Making aeroplanes, making rockets, and getting blasted. Laughter. Why are they struggling so much? The same energy, the same power, the same tapasya. Because all this needs tapasya, right? So much money is needed, so much practice is needed, so much technology is needed for putting one thing to work. So if the same time is involved in internal development, then you can levitate. Right? Why you need food? Aircrafts.

### material desires, yogic transcendentalists, science of Krishna consciousness

**Key Quote:** "This science of Krishna consciousness has to be understood."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the desires of materialists with the goals of transcendentalists, emphasizing that the yogic transcendentalists can reach higher planetary systems, but the ultimate goal is to go beyond the material world through the science of Krishna consciousness.

So the soul can be lifted up. The problem is that I want to go with my material desire. I want to go with this mind. I want to go with this conditioning. That is not possible. So we are controlled. So transcendentalists want to go beyond this material conditioning. So the yogic transcendentalists, they can go to Satyaloka, Tapaloka, beyond Svarga. Brahma is in Satyaloka. Everything is dissolved in this material world. Brahmaloka will always be there. Satyaloka will always be there. Until the day of Brahma. That also has to wind up. So traveling to different planets in this material world is not a very big exciting thing for a transcendentalist who want to go beyond this material world. So that is easy for bhakti yogis because bhakti yogis, they understand the Lord who is in this beyond this material world, that is my destination. This is not my destination. My destination is there with the Lord. The Lord with the transcendental body and I also have a transcendental body which is engaged today. That is why this world is called Durga, prison house. We are in the prison house, limited by this body, by the iron bars of this body. So when we are liberated, we are in this spiritual world. So this is called science of Krishna consciousness. Prabhupada always mentioned. This science of Krishna consciousness has to be understood. Those who understand this science, Prabhupada does not say religion, this belief, this faith. This is beyond belief and faith and religion. This is pure science. So people say, no, no, no I cannot be sectarian, I have to be secular. We are not even saying secular or sectarian, we are saying scientific. We are all scientists. We are all scientists. Chandras, Tilak, Shikha. What are we science? What is the science we are following? The science of getting out of this material body. The science of going beyond this body which is limiting us and going to a world which is unlimited. So that world which is unlimited, like Brahma Samhita says, the world, the real world of spiritual life.

### personalism, devotee's goal, awakening the soul

**Key Quote:** "The process of awakening the soul is this great chanting of liberation."
**Summary:** This segment highlights the importance of intelligence and the right Shastra in understanding personalism beyond material limitations, emphasizing the devotee's goal of gradually understanding the supreme truth and awakening the soul through chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra.

No material body. So to understand that there is personalism beyond this material limitation, you need Sumedha Saha. You need intelligence. And that intelligence comes by reading the right Shastra. Not people who want to create something of their own. That is the beauty of Bhagavatam in the Vaishnava Parampara which clearly describes our rotation and clearly describes what destination we have to go to and how to go to that destination. That is Bhagavatam philosophy. Step by step going out. It may take many lifetimes. Devotees are not concerned about that. Devotees are concerned that am I gradually understanding the supreme truth in its real form and am I understanding the cheating which is going on in this body. Cheating means limitations which is going on in the body. Which is controlling my soul within this body. By making me do what the body wants. By making me do what my mind wants. And what my false ego wants. And not allowing me to do what my soul wants. Soul is sleeping. So the process of awakening the soul is this great chanting of liberation like Prabhupada says. This chanting of Hare Krishna Mahamantra is a great chanting for liberation. Because sound, through sound we can liberate. Yogis try to liberate through yogic practices. Because the life air is controlled. The soul is balanced by the life force within the body. So by controlling the life air he can pull out the soul out. Like we saw in previous verses. How a yogi can pull out from the cerebrum of the head. They can pull out. Transcendentalist can dissolve himself. Naithi, naithi, naithi I am not this body, I am not this body. I am not this matter, I am not this mind.

**Key Quote:** "Activities are not stopped."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the different paths to liberation, including yoga and transcendentalism, and emphasizes that devotees understand the activity of the soul and gain admission into the spiritual world where they can continue activity free from material limitations.

And he understands spirit means some impersonal energy, which is also part of the absolute. Fortunate yogis can go up to Paramatma. And devotees they understand the activity of the soul. When you understand the activity of the soul then we get admission into the spiritual world, where we can continue activity free from all the limitations. Activities are not stopped. So we in the material world sometimes we don't understand what is spiritual activity. Because we know activity means limitation. I can do certain thing. I can only lift 100 kilos. Or maybe 50 kilos. I am limited by my body. I can understand some formula. I can understand beyond that. I am limited by my intelligence. I can desire and own and control this many number of people of this caliber. Not beyond that. Again I am controlled. So that is what happens in this material world of control. How do we go beyond this control? But that doesn't mean that I am not at all controlled. Spiritually also we are controlled. We are eternally controlled. But we are controlled by the Supreme Lord. His internal energy. Control means not like material control. It is just like saying this small finger is controlled by the body. It is not that this is restricted. That control has no restriction. This control has utilization. This small pinky finger is used for this body. What the body wants it does. That way it is subservient to the body. But it is part of the body. And it is also enjoying along with the body. Same way when Prabhupada says the spirit soul is part and parcel of the whole. And it is supposed to serve the whole. It does not mean the servant relationship in the material world. It is a mutually useful relation. Just like the fingers and the body. So the spirit souls are supposed to serve the Supreme Whole. Supreme Lord Krishna. And by that service he is also served. He is also happy. He is also nourished. That is a connection of a devotee and Supreme Lord, which is full of activities, which is free from material limitations, starting from false ego, and all the limiting factors in the material world.

**Key Quote:** "It is up to us whether we want to run around this universe in bliss or we have to run around with fear."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts material and spiritual addiction, highlighting the importance of associating with the transcendental through chanting and surrendering to Krishna's spiritual energy, using the examples of Narada and Durvasa to illustrate the difference between running around in bliss and running around with fear.

Which is different things. Karma, Krodha, Moha, Mada, Matsarya. All these things limit us. Anger limits us. Karma limits us. It doesn't limit us. It makes us a person. Makes us a person who is dependent. Addicted to that. Addicted to material things. But simultaneously we practice being addicted to spiritual things. Gradually, gradually. Chanting of the holy name, which is transcendental. We are associating with transcendental. So we want to be controlled by the spiritual energy of Krishna. Materialists want to be controlled by the material energy of Krishna. Like two personalities given example here. Narada and Durvasa. Narada is controlled by Krishna. But he is free. He can travel anywhere. You can say Durvasa also travelled everywhere. But he is not under the control of Krishna. See what happened to be under the control of Maya. He was a great mystic. But he had this ambition to be a great person. He had the arrogance of belittling others. As long as he has all this arrogance belittling others. Pride. Karma. You are controlling the material world. So that is a controlled life. He is running around the universe. Why is he running around? He is running around because Sudarshan is behind him. But he has a capacity to run because he was a great yogi. He is going to Shivaloka, Brahmaloka almost like Vaikuntha. Must be Swetha Deepa. See that Swetha Deepa is a spiritual world. Even though it is part of material world. He is running everywhere. Narada is also running everywhere. But he is running in bliss. So it is up to us whether we want to run around this universe in bliss or we have to run around with fear.

**Key Quote:** "If our consciousness is materially contaminated then we are in a different consciousness."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Krishna's energy can be displayed according to our consciousness, emphasizing the need to sacrifice material things and cultivate spiritual habits like surrender, humility, and knowledge to achieve a spiritual consciousness.

As long as we are in the grip of material world we are running around with fear. As it is said Krishna's energy of two types. One is energy which is supporting you. Other one is energy which is punishing you. Prabhupada is an example of a cat. The same cat. Same teeth. Very very sharp teeth. It is carrying a kitten. The same teeth it is carrying a rat. A rat is like Durvasa. Shivering and afraid in the mouth of the cat. Narada is like a kitten. In the same mouth. So the energy of the Lord can be displayed according to our consciousness. If our consciousness is materially contaminated then we are in a different consciousness. Material consciousness, which is limiting. If we are in a spiritual consciousness surrendered to the Supreme Lord then we are orbiting in a different orbit. So it is up to us. Today Bhagavatam step by step is teaching how to go beyond the material thing to the transcendental world. So transcendentalists are not interested in roaming around in this world. But they are more interested in freeing themselves and seeing their real form in the spirit, as a spirit soul, and engage in Krishna's service in the spiritual world. So that should be the goal of our life, which may mean denying certain things in this material world. Without sacrificing, we don't get that. So we need to sacrifice material things. So material things are name, fame, position, power, money, women, family, business, power to control. When we give these things up then we inculcate spiritual habits. Spiritual habits are surrender, humility, knowledge, always differentiating what is matter, what is spirit. Engaging only in spiritual activity. Always subservient to the Supreme Lord. And always friendly to all the other creations of the Lord. Not only that we are subservient to the Lord we are subservient to all the other things. All the living entity is created by the Lord. Then he becomes a friend of all the living entity. Then he becomes friend of this world also. Water, air, forest, soil, energies, everything is Lord's. So he uses it all in a friendly way. Not in an exploiting way.

### devotees, impersonalists, surrender

**Key Quote:** "To give up to become surrendered is very very difficult."
**Summary:** This segment distinguishes between devotees and impersonalists, emphasizing that devotees are dedicated and surrendered to the Lord, while impersonalists are frustrated with the material world and still trying to exploit the Lord, highlighting that surrender is the most difficult thing to achieve.

So two kinds of transcendentalists. One kind of transcendentalists who are called devotees. They are dedicated to the Lord. Other kind of transcendentalists are people who are frustrated with the material world. And they are in a denying position. They are still trying to exploit the Lord. Even impersonalists are not dedicated. They are not surrendered. They are out of the material world but they are not surrendered. So devotee is the only person who is surrendered and who is in the real reality. Others are all assumed reality. Material world is assumed reality. Impersonalism is also a kind of assumed reality because he is not coming to his real position of subservient. He also wants to be like God or Brahma Jyoti. There is still no surrender there. To give up to become surrendered is very very difficult. Most difficult thing. You may say yoga is very difficult. Jnana is very difficult. But actually surrendering is most difficult. So bhakti yuga they say bhakti yuga is for all japa madhav. All for people who don't understand knowledge. People who don't understand yoga. Try to do that. Bring a yogi and tell him to get up for three sixty five days. He will give up and go. He will say no yoga is better. Bring a jnani and tell him to surrender and wash pots everyday. So surrender is most difficult than yoga and jnana. Even though they say that bhakti is for people who don't understand. Sometimes it's good. When you don't understand it's easy to surrender. If you understand too much then it becomes very difficult to surrender also.

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee he knows going to different planets wasting their time they will say."
**Summary:** This segment explains that bhakti yoga is internally connected to the Supreme Lord, granting devotees knowledge of everything, and emphasizes that a pure devotee understands the futility of material pursuits like exploring different planets, focusing instead on escaping the prison house of the material world.

So one way they are correct. So if you remain simple and humble and uneducated in the material sense, you become educated in the spiritual sense. Because a pure devotee he knows going to different planets wasting their time they will say. They don't know anything about physics. They don't know anything about world economy. But they will simply say simply why are they struggling all these things. Because bhakti yoga is internally connected to supreme lord. When you are in connection with supreme lord you know the entire philosophy entire biology entire chemistry, entire physics entire aerodynamics everything they will know. Why? Everything is created by the lord. So when you say a devotee knows everything it doesn't mean that he is expert in chemistry. He is expert in such a way that he identifies everything as the lord's energy and he keeps it in its place. But he understands the superior position of the spirit and engages in the spiritual activity. Because a person in the jail is not very much interested in becoming popular in the jail. He is saying I want to get out of this jail. I am the most obedient jailer. Or I am the most powerful jail. Jail. What do you call them? Prisoner. I am the great prisoner here. I am the most, I am the best singer prisoner. I am the best body builder prisoner. I am the best intellectual prisoner. You are in the prison. But a humble simple person say I want to finish my 20 years and get out. So this prison house how much knowledge you want of the prison? Same way how much knowledge of this material world we need? Moon, Sun, Mars, billions and billions of stars are there. We are not even know once we went to moon and came back wasted money. If at all we went. Forgot it. Now want to go to another place. This is called Marakatavairagya. Monkey goes to one tree, eats some fruit, throws it then goes to next tree. Eats something, goes to next tree. So he went to moon, not interested. Going to Mars, not interested. They will keep

**Key Quote:** "What is knowledge and what is not knowledge?"
**Summary:** This segment contrasts objective knowledge of the material world with subjective knowledge concerning the soul and its relationship with everything, emphasizing that true knowledge consists of humility, sastric knowledge, tolerance, and patience.

jumping like this. So what are these planets? What are these stars? What is this material world? What is spiritual world? How to go to spiritual world? What is knowledge? What is not knowledge? In Bhagavad Gita Krishna says what is knowledge and what is not knowledge? Ignorance. You don't find knowledge of chemistry, biology, maths, statistics. You don't find. That is not given as part of knowledge. Knowledge is given as humility, sastric knowledge, tolerance, patience. This is called as knowledge. Because by these things you can really can get the real knowledge. Others are all very objective knowledge of these objects you see beyond you. Other one is a subjective knowledge which is concerning you the soul and your relationship with all that you see. We stop here. Any questions or comments?

**Key Quote:** "The transcendentalists are concerned with spiritual body."
**Summary:** This segment reiterates the importance of focusing on the spiritual body and following regulative principles, emphasizing that fruitive workers cannot move around in an unrestricted manner.

So the transcendentalists are concerned with spiritual body. Not just material body. They are concerned with the soul. And by the strength of devotional service, they go beyond this material world. As long as we are fruity workers or gross materialistic, we cannot move around in this unrestricted manner. Okay. Pooja's. And also Prabhupada mentions that when we chant and follow the four divine principles, Prabhupada takes us back to the body. So when Prabhupada is saying that the four divine principles, that means that the in the six ways. So Prabhupada also says that . . No. When you say regulative principles, it is for the entire body. And what is this entire body? It is gross and subtle. Both together are we. We are not just a gross form. We are not a lump of flesh. This this is grossness and subtleness both are involved. So when you say if regulative principles had to be followed, we should not do that in the subtle form. I am not drinking coffee but 24 hours I am thinking the smell of coffee. So that is not following regulative principles. I want to give up sense gratification but I am sitting and thinking only of sense gratification, nice eating, nice ice cream, nice vehicles going outside,

### subtle sense gratification, mithyacharya, 100% purification

**Key Quote:** "There is no question of going back to Godhead without 100% purification."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of following regulative principles in both gross and subtle forms, warning against subtle sense gratification and highlighting the need for 100% purification to return to Godhead.

like I joined ISKCON, I can't go out but nice. So that is also subtle sense gratification. Like Krishna says, a person who is not intelligent senses but who is meditating on sense objects is only mithyacharya. He is only a, he is only acting as he is a spiritualist. He is not spiritualist. So when you say you, when Bhagavatam or Gita, anybody says you, it means you the full you. Which is, you means what? You the soul, you the contaminated consciousness, you the subtle body, you the gross body, you with all your karmas, all your prarabdha karmas, all your present thoughts, everything is called you. You is a very general term. So when you say you means, or I, when you say I, I means all these things and I have to follow the regulatory principle. So I have to follow the regulatory principles in the gross form, in the subtle form, in the mental form, in the false ego form, in the imaginative form, in other forms of your existence, of awareness, you should not be aware of that. So we don't be aware of these things but we be aware of Krishna. So when awareness comes, that is consciousness. So we have to consciously not be conscious of the relative, of the force interactivities. We have to be consciously aware of devotional practices. Then we are called followers of Prabhupada. Only then Prabhupada will take you. There is no question of going back to Godhead without 100% purification. And Prabhupada will take only people who are 100% pure. But Prabhupada is available to you to become pure by serving him. That is the meaning of saying, I will take you. Prabhupada when he says, I will take you means what? Even if he is not following forward, drag him and take him back to Godhead. That is not the meaning. When you say Prabhupada will take us back to Godhead, as long as we are followers of Prabhupada, following 100% and becoming pure, then he is a way for us to easily go to Krishna. That is the meaning of that. Not that even if you are not qualified, no, no, no, Prabhupada will take us back to Godhead. Just like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, you chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra, Harinam, Sankirtan, that is enough. You will get mukti. But along with that comes a big rule. What is the big rule? Ten offences showed in it. So chanting, you chant Haripol, Haripol, Haripol, you can come, but along with that you have to do ten things to give up. That giving up is a many lifetimes job.

**Summary:** The speaker draws a parallel between the Brahmastra and modern nuclear weapons, explaining the concept of converting matter into energy.

As we discussed last time, Brahmastra is similar to the nuclear weapon of modern days. The nuclear weapon generates energy by converting matter into energy by atomic fission or fusion, and the mass is transformed into energy.

**Key Quote:** "Whatever the Shastra says, it is a great science, science is included, this modern science is included in the Bhagavata."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how modern science, particularly Einstein's equation, validates the concept of the Brahmastra and suggests that the Srimad Bhagavatam contains advanced scientific knowledge.

I think two weeks back, when I took class and all of you were here, I explained how the Brahmastra, if we had read about it in the year 1900, in the beginning, no scientist would believe that, 'Oh, what is this they are talking about? Brahmastra, a weapon which is just like that, just like that, from nothing, light would come out, heat would come out.' They would never believe. But after the 1920s, later on, after Albert Einstein wrote that famous equation E=mc squared, that mass can be converted into energy, so mass is everywhere, atoms are everywhere, any atom can be converted into energy. It is a very difficult process, means difficult in modern technology, but a well-trained Brahmana could release this Brahmastra, could release this energy. And this is what we discussed last time, how whatever the Shastra says, it is a great science. Science is included, this modern science is included in the Bhagavata.

And then we moved from material atomic energy and the Brahmastra subject, we moved to spiritual technology of releasing spiritual energy. Just like Brahmastra released material energy, we discussed Brahmastra released material energy by chanting certain mantras, we discussed how spiritual energy can be released by chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, and the Adhyatmika Shakti is not light and heat, but it is Sat Chit and Ananda, Sat Shakti, Chit Shakti, and Ananda Shakti.

**Key Quote:** "If we hear the Mahamantra attentively without any distraction, mantra after mantra if you hear that, then our Atma will touch our soul, our real existence will touch the absolute existence Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of attentive chanting (Japa) of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra to connect the soul with Krishna and liberate it from the illusion of material existence.

For that, we have to come in touch with the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, with the sound of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Therefore, we discussed how during Japa, we have to attentively hear the Mahamantra. If we hear the Mahamantra attentively without any distraction, mantra after mantra, if you hear that, then our Atma will touch, our soul, our real existence will touch the absolute existence, Krishna, because the Nama is not different from the Lord himself, from the absolute existence. And when there is transfer of Sat Shakti from the Hare Krishna Mahamantra by touching the supreme Sat or existence, our existence will be lightened up, our pure eternal existence will lighten up, will get energized. Right now, our Sat, means existence, we all know we exist beyond this body also. We know there is existence, that sense of being, sense of existence is now trapped by the material energy, and therefore we are thinking we are this body. Therefore, the existence, existence which is existence means eternal existence, eternal existence is trapped in this body of non-existence. Beyond this body, eternal existence is beyond this body. This body is beginning to end, so one small existence we experience in this body, but actually we, the soul, is eternal existence. So we are actually trapped in this non-existence. Non-existence means anything that has beginning and end has no existence ultimately. Existence means it should forever remain there. So we are trapped, the real existence or real Sat is trapped in Asat body.

**Key Quote:** "By touching the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, by touching the sound Hare Krishna Mahamantra, when there is flow of Sat energy by the mercy of the Lord, then one existence would lighten up its eternal existence beyond this body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how connecting with the Hare Krishna Mahamantra allows the flow of Sat energy, illuminating one's eternal existence, and how distractions of the mind hinder this process during Japa.

So by touching the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, by touching the sound Hare Krishna Mahamantra, when there is flow of Sat energy by the mercy of the Lord, then one's existence would lighten up its eternal existence beyond this body. But it is energy that has to come into you. That energy can come only by associating with Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Then we discussed how actually we can come in touch with the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. The real way to touch the Hare Krishna Mahamantra is through Japa, but then Japa should be done in a right way so that the touching of the soul and the Hare Krishna sound happens. For that, we said we have to be attentive to hear the holy name during Japa, and then we discussed how the mind creates, takes away attention from Japa into various different thinking processes, processing, lamenting, rejoicing, dreaming, planning, all this kind of things, activity our mind gets sucked into it while we are doing the Japa. So when the attention is sucked by all these activities, thinking activities, attention is not available for hearing the chanting that you are doing, therefore you are not, your Atma is not touching the holy name.

**Key Quote:** "Your Japa is just automatic, you are chanting round after round and then your Japa is finishing but your thinking has not finished."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how inattentive chanting leads to mechanical repetition without genuine connection, emphasizing the need for continuous attention during Japa to avoid disconnection.

Then after that, your Japa is just automatic. You are chanting round after round, and then your Japa is finishing, but your thinking has not finished. You are continuing your problem solving, planning, lamenting, rejoicing, dreaming, worrying, or doing some other activity. I did, last time we discussed, you are doing some other activity, your mind is busy directing your senses, but you are automatically chanting. The whole key thing is the sound you have to hear. We discussed the example of the iron put in the fire, and the iron is put in the fire, slowly it gets heated, heated, heated and becomes red hot. So in the same way, the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, if you touch the sound, then our Atma will get spiritualized, the spiritual energy will come from the holy name, how we will get spiritualized. But it is not, suppose you take a piece of iron, put in the fire, again take it out five minutes, then again one minute in the fire, then again five minutes outside, then again one minute inside, five minutes outside, will it get really heated? No, because you put inside, it comes out again, it is cooling off, isn't it? So in the same way, if we chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra, if you give attention to it, we have to give continuous attention to finish a Mala. In between, you should not do anything.

**Key Quote:** "You should make a sankalpa to keep the iron in the fire for quite some time, at least one Mala you take, nothing I shall do now from beginning to end of this Mala, I shall continue to do this only nothing else."
**Summary:** The speaker advises making a firm resolve (sankalpa) to maintain continuous attention during at least one round of Japa, avoiding any distractions to prevent disconnection from the sound (Shabda).

If you do anything, then you are, you are taking out of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, you are taking your soul out, gets disconnected. And why disconnection also is like a inattentive, means one of the ten offenses is what? To be inattentive while chanting. So you are attentive a little, taking attention away, some thinking, again thinking, or sometimes nothing, not even hearing one. So what is required is you should make a sankalpa to keep the iron in the fire for quite some time, at least one Mala you take, nothing I shall do now. From beginning to end of this Mala, I shall continue to do this only, nothing else. And we discussed how mind can do one activity which will not disturb Japa. What is that activity? Can somebody tell who was there? Checking, following and checking. So following and checking continuously, you should not break. Why you should not break? Because if you break, mind doesn't keep quiet, it goes to some other subject. That means you get disconnected from the Shabda.

**Summary:** The speaker suggests engaging the mind by actively following the activity of chanting and hearing, similar to following a ball in table tennis, to maintain focus during Japa.

So you have to follow, follow and check, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. And I gave the example last time of how, I gave the example of how, what is this following activity of the mind, thinking activity, lamenting, all those listed, I listed it. There is one activity of the mind which you can follow, follow a doing, follow an activity. Just like if I tell you, please follow the, somebody is playing table tennis and I tell you engage your mind in following the ball where it goes. So your mind is going there, here, here, here, here, your attention is behind the ball where it is going, this side, that side, this side, this side it's going, isn't it? That is the mind can follow an activity. So similarly, the mind should follow the activity of chanting and hearing, and by doing that automatically you are hearing, automatically you are hearing, your attention is following the activity of your attention is on the hearing.

**Summary:** Using the analogy of counting train bogies, the speaker illustrates how focusing attention on a specific task keeps the mind engaged, and reiterates the importance of continuous attention during chanting, comparing it to keeping iron in the fire to heat it thoroughly.

Another example I gave you is how if you are standing in the railway station, railway platform and one train is going across and if I tell you just count the number of bogies that will go by then your attention will be one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 100 90 101 12 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 30 you should hear, hear, hear, hear, hear without break, hear, hear, hear, hear then only the iron is inside the fire.

**Key Quote:** "At least train yourself that one mala is I will have a sankalpa that from beginning till end of this mala I have a sankalpa I will not do anything with my mind but only follow the Hare Krishna mantra."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of making a strong resolve (sankalpa) to focus solely on the Hare Krishna mantra during Japa, defining Japa as a meditation on doing rather than seeing.

For sufficiently long time, then you will see one mala at least, afterwards one mala also move the sakshi mala and go on, but at least train yourself that one mala is, I will have a sankalpa that from beginning till end of this mala, I have a sankalpa I will not do anything with my mind but only follow the Hare Krishna mantra. For instance, if he does not release the sankalpa, I have started now, first bead, he should release the sankalpa from the soul, sankalpa shakti comes from the soul, from the sankalpa then it goes to the mind, then Krishna deepens will help you make that sankalpa stronger, but you have to start your sankalpa, I want to hear without distraction, that sankalpa is there, then you will see that it will happen. If you don't have sankalpa, simply Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, if you don't have sankalpa shakti from the soul coming, you will see suddenly somewhere mind will take and go away and then you chanting will become mechanical, your consciousness attention is somewhere else. So each of our soul shakti, ICCHA shakti, ICCHA is very clear to touch the Holy name of the Lord, then sankalpa should be there to finish mala after mala after mala after mala. So Japa, it's actually a meditation on doing. It is not a meditation on seeing. It's a meditation on doing.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between meditation on seeing and meditation on doing, explaining that Japa is the latter, requiring focused engagement in chanting and hearing, and that the mala aids in giving the mind a connected task.

That means we have, there is a particular thing being done: chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting. Meditation means what? Don't move out of that activity. Stay in that activity. That is meditation of doing. What is meditation of seeing? Don't take your vision from something. Be there only. Be concentrated, concentrated, concentrated seeing. Say, I keep on seeing this mic. Don't take your mind, don't take your mind anywhere other than that. Seeing, seeing, seeing, seeing. Japa is not seeing meditation. Japa is doing meditation. That means don't do anything else. Stay only this, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing. Complete, mala, beat after beat, beat after beat, beat after beat. That is, that is why you need, you don't need seeing concentration for Japa. You need doing concentration. There are two things that are happening. One doing is you are speaking. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, speaking. Another doing is what? You are hearing. There are two activities going on. Speaking and hearing, speaking and hearing, speaking and hearing. This activity alone, you follow this. You follow your own speaking and you follow your own hearing. Then you will see that. Automatically, the mind is fully engaged. The mind will not go somewhere else. And I explained last time also, the spiritual technology, why the, our acharyas are given mala to do Japa with mala. It is to give work to the mind. To give work to the mind. Otherwise, mind will do unrelated work. Let it at least do a work which is connected to Japa. Okay, I heard. One is over. Two is over. Three is over. It's connected work.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of maintaining a strong resolve (sankalpa) and determination to stay focused on the sound of the Hare Krishna mantra during Japa, preventing the mind from wandering and ensuring a connection with the divine.

When you chant, initially, you start with the first beat. I have to hear. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then next, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama. Between the two beats, the sankalpa shakti should be there to go, to go forward. Should not. There has, your soul has to be. When you are trying to chant, then the mind will slowly take you out of the fire. When you are hearing Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, you are already in the fire of Satchidananda. That is the Hare Krishna mantra, if you are hearing. But the mind slowly takes you out of the fire, just like the iron piece. The mind comes and takes you out of the fire. So you have to insist, have sankalpa, determination. Yes, at least this one mala, I will be inside. Nothing. I won't come out of this sound. Jaya Grandarachi. Madbhagavatam ki jaye. Jagat Guru Shiloprao paad ki jaye. Hare Krishna Maha Mantra ki jaye.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Asuras are captivated by ignorance and are foolish because they are attracted to the illusory attractions of the material world.

were completely floored by the beautiful woman, and after that they simply seized her, grabbed her, they embraced her. So Prabhupada is explaining here that the Asuras are described as Mudadhya, meaning they are captivated by ignorance. So only those who are captivated by the mode of ignorance and passion will subject themselves to this force of false attraction, illusory attraction in this material world, and they are considered to be Mudadhya, means not very intelligent, or they are foolish. One who knows things as they are, then one would not run after the things in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "One gives experience of gold, the other one is real gold and real gold also gives experience of gold but it has also got the value of gold that is a difference."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of real gold versus plated gold, the speaker explains the difference between experiential truth and existential truth, highlighting that true value lies in something being both experientially and existentially true.

In other words, if you really want to buy gold, then you have to, unless you get real gold, you are cheated. Something will be gold-like, plated gold. It will look bad, but look like gold for the senses. It looks like gold. There's no difference between the rolled gold and the plated gold and real gold. There's no difference for the senses, but for the value there will be a difference. One has no value, the other has got very high value comparatively, and one has no value. So one gives experience of gold, the other one is real gold, and real gold also gives experience of gold, but it has also got the value of gold. That is the difference. One is experientially true, the other one is experientially true and existentially true. In existence also it is real gold.

**Key Quote:** "To establish the existential truth of something, any amount of experiences with the senses will not determine that truth. One has to go beyond the senses and go to the intelligence."
**Summary:** The speaker asserts that sensory experience alone cannot establish existential truth; one must go beyond the senses to intelligence and spiritual knowledge (Guru, Sadhu, and Shastra).

So any sense perception, anything that we see, if it is only true experientially, it is not necessary that it is truth. Truth has to be established independently on the basis of experience. For instance, you watch a movie. Once you go into the movie world, it's a real experience. It is a real experience. The experience is as real as real life experience, no difference. But is that true existentially true? No. Experientially true, but existentially false. Now if you want to analyze, you want to, whether that movie is existentially true or experientially, I am seeing it is true. Now I want to find out whether it is existentially true. So you analyze the movie more and more. The movie plot, you go into the movie plot. Okay, in the movie plot, this character, that character, you go on analyzing. Will you ever come out of the movie? No. In other words, to establish the existential truth of something, any amount of experiences with the senses will not determine that truth. One has to go beyond the senses and go to the intelligence. And intelligence, the source of that intelligence should be independent of that movie, because intelligence is not coming from the movie. And that is the third source. It is not coming from the movie, and that is spiritual knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "There is only way to establish whether an experience is existentially true or not, is by a third source, that is Shastra."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Shastra is the only reliable source for determining whether an experience is existentially true, as our senses are prone to illusion.

Guru, Sadhu and Shastra. The spiritual knowledge, even though it is available in ordinary, material paper, material ink. It is available here. PRESENT TRUTH. But that is not real spiritual knowledge. It is manifesting like this, like any other ordinary book. But the vibration, the sound that is generated, the sound that it represents, this transcendental knowledge, that is the independent source, independent of our sensual perceptions. Our sensual perceptions can make mistakes, commit tendencies for illusion, cheating, all these things. So there is no question of establishing whether something is illusion or whether something is true by your senses, you cannot. There is only way to establish whether an experience is existentially true or not, is by a third source, that is Shastra.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of buying gold-plated items to illustrate how those who rely solely on sensory experience, without using intelligence, can be easily cheated.

So the asuras, muddhya means foolish, they go only by experience, mode of passion. Right now, yes, this experience is real, so it must be real. It must be real. That is enough for them. Subtitles by the Amara.org community But for somebody who is having that weakness, suppose somebody is only experience, he only wants experience of gold. He goes to a shop full of gold-plated items, cheating, and the person wants, oh, so nice, like gold, gold, shining, oh, this is nice shining gold, give me that. Subtitles by the Amara.org community He will pay the price of gold and take it. Subtitles by the Amara.org community The person is influenced by only experience, not using the intelligence.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that while all sense experience in the material world is illusion, a devotee filters experiences through the lens of the shastras, engaging in authorized sense gratification, which is better than being an Asura.

He is using intelligence, knowledge and intelligence. Subtitles by the Amara.org community Subtitles by the Amara.org community Subtitles by the Amara.org community Pleasure means, experience means, I'll jump over it. Whereas a gentleman, a human being, who is progressive in his life, he accepts pleasures which are only, not only experiential, but it should also have, and every experience in this material world, every sense experience is illusion. Among the illusions, again there is filter, what is permitted by the shastras. Just like Krishna says, I am sex life according to regulative principles. So, a sura, or a devotee, he falls in love. He falls into the category of authorized sense gratification. That's kamabhakta. They are not talking about pure devotees. Asuras and suras, you can say. Whereas a pure devotee, he sees that this is all illusion. Authorized or unauthorized, it's all illusion. If I can come out of it, that is the purpose of moving from asuric thing to suric thing. That means by becoming an obedient sense enjoyer is better than being an asura.

**Key Quote:** "Soul is not directly feeling anything in this world."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that those seeking ultimate truth understand that experiences are generated by the material body, mind, and intelligence, while the soul merely observes, identifying with the feelings of the 'yantra' (machine).

That is the verdict of the scriptures. But ultimately, those who want to go out of this material world, those who want ultimate truth, absolute truth, they understand that all these things are created by this body, which is body, mind and intelligence, which is a material yantra. And all experiences are generated out of this yantra. And the soul is only a kshetrajna. Soul is not feeling anything. Soul is feeling the feeling. Soul is not directly feeling anything in this world. When you feel angry with someone, you are not angry. Your kshetra is generating that anger and you are identifying with that anger. It is not direct feeling. The feeling of the yantra, you are identifying. Thinking of the yantra, you are identifying. Impulses of the yantra, you are misunderstanding to be your decision, your impulses. prakṛtaya kriyamānāni guṇaya karmāni sarvaśa āhankāraṁ itimam āhankāraṁ kartāḥ itimanyate So, only by a false ego, one thinks one is doing, one is, you know, it is my feeling, it is my, I am angry, etc., etc. I am having pleasure, all these things.

**Key Quote:** "In the same way, in this material world, maya is expert, expert like a jeweler who cheats. She is expert. Her job is to duplicate the gold of the spiritual world here."
**Summary:** The speaker compares Maya to a jeweler who expertly duplicates gold, creating illusions of thinking, feeling, and willing, just as the soul does, to deceive people in the material world.

So, but the nature of the soul is to feel, to think, feel and will. Body cannot think, feel and will. But at the same time, maya is so powerful, she creates an illusion of thinking, feeling and willing. Just like the jeweler is so expert, that he plates it and makes it appear like gold. Copper, he will make it appear like gold. So that all the customers will go and buy it, pay the price of gold and buy it. Foolish customers will go, pay the price of gold and buy it. In the same way, in this material world, maya is expert, expert like a jeweler who cheats. She is expert. Her job is to duplicate the gold of the spiritual world here. Her business is to duplicate beauty here. Just like rolled gold will be only skin deep, isn't it? If you bend that copper like this, suddenly inside you will see copper. So it is little micron thickness. So the truth of that gold is only micron thickness, isn't it? Similarly, the shastra says that all beauties in this world is only skin deep. The luster of the skin, etc. is duplicated just like in the spiritual world. The color, the luster, everything. The look, it looks like that.

But actually that is not satchitananda, it is skin. Leather, leather. Suppose you are able to, you know, create a leather. A satchitananda leather. To duplicate satchitananda. That is what it is. All of us are having a body, a mechanism packed in a leather bag. First something is all set up. Just like suppose you make a framework. In steel rod you make framework. Two legs and this and that and chest and ribs and everything. And then now some moving items are there. Okay, kidney I will hang here. Heart I will fit here, put one belt here. Exactly like that only, everything is hanging. Heart is hanging, one liver is hanging, then all connections are given. Then pumping system is there, blood is given. All this is going on. Yantra rudhani maya, it is yantra. But how many times do we think it is an yantra?

**Key Quote:** "We create in our mind illusion. And that mannequin, that fiberglass doll is just a trigger in your mind."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a mannequin in a saree shop, the speaker explains how Maya duplicates names, forms, and qualities, triggering desires and illusions in our minds, leading us to paste our identity onto the body.

We don't think. Just like in the saree shop outside you have mannequins. Fiberglass model of women and they wear saree. They decorate that mannequin with saree. Those who have desire, they see if people don't, if people see it as plastic. You think anybody, anybody will set it up outside the shop. Outside the shop. Suppose everybody is knowledgeable. Plastic. Those who have desire, they will see that model wearing the saree. They will project their own face there, how nice I will be there. And then they will enter the saree shop. Because this is how it is. We create in our mind illusion. And that mannequin, that fiberglass doll is just a trigger in your mind. You are just waiting to see how you will feel in that shanee. So in the material world, varieties of names and forms and qualities and persons and everything is duplicated by maya. But the person, where is the person? The person is in the body. You don't even see the person. The person is travelling in the body. But you paste, we paste the identity of the person onto the body.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that we live in a bodily concept of life, residing in the subtle body, and Krishna consciousness aims to shift us to a spiritual concept of life, realizing ourselves as spirit souls with the potential for a sacchidananda body.

We ourselves first paste our identity that I am this body. And we continue going on life like this. Right from childhood we are grown, slowly we start identifying how. Each of our limbs are under our control, so it's me, it is me. I cannot control your hand, so I don't think that hand is mine. I can control my hand, so I think this is me. Hand, leg, so finally you think this body is me. And then you create a bodily concept of life. Body is different, bodily concept is different. Bodily concept is where? It is in the subtle body. So actually we are living in bodily concept of life. We are not living in the body. If you are living in the body then you become immediately conscious. Oh, what is this? This is a yantra. But you live in the bodily concept of life. So Krishna consciousness is meant to take us out of this bodily concept of life and come into spiritual concept of life. I am spirit soul. To start with. Then I am sacchidananda body. That one gets a sacchidananda body.

**Key Quote:** "Unless and until we start seeing people differently, we will also be in the bodily concept of life."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that spiritual progress requires changing our perception, seeing people not as bodies but as conscious souls, understanding that the body is merely a neutral extension of the pancha bhuta (five elements).

Which is duplicated by material energy in this world. So by hearing, the scriptures, that is intelligence, one changes his perception. Because illusion is a perception. Unless and until we start seeing people differently, we will also be in the bodily concept of life. A spiritualist, a devotee, he starts seeing people. Perception of people is the most important thing for spiritualist. One who is interested, one who is progressing in spiritual life, one who wants to be a Vaishnava, his perception of people is very important. One cannot perceive the others as bodies. One should see, separate the body. A body is simply neutral. Body has actually no consciousness. Consciousness is separate, body is separate. There is no difference between the body and the floor in which you are sitting. It is just an extension of pancha bhuta, that's all. That much pancha bhuta in your body, which is your body, you have control, that's all. But there is no difference on the floor. Because floor also doesn't talk, body also doesn't talk. Isn't it? Floor also doesn't think, your body also doesn't think. Floor also doesn't feel, your body also doesn't feel. The soul in the body thinks, the soul in the body feels, the soul in the body wills. But because we are in bodily concept of life,

**Key Quote:** "So that's why maya has created this body, so all quality should appear."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Maya has created the body to duplicate the qualities of the soul (thinking, feeling, willing), leading to the illusion of identifying with the body and its characteristics, such as being male or female.

my soul's thinking is influenced by this yantra. This is very nicely set up pancha bhuta, which duplicates, like a person. Because you see, if you want to duplicate gold ornaments, by just giving a layer of gold, you have to be very expert. Everything that appears there in the real gold should also appear here. All quality should appear here. So that's why maya has created this body, so all quality should appear. What is the quality of a soul? Thinking, feeling and willing. So you think you are the body, and the body is thinking, feeling and willing. I am this body, I am a man, I am a woman. So my moment I say I am a woman, my feeling, my identification, everything is colored of being a woman. I am a man. Immediately your consciousness is colored as a man. So the attraction in the material world, if you see the attraction between male and female, that's the subject that is here, the attraction between male and female has no sound basis in the spiritual platform. Why? Because to say that I am a male is first illusion, to say that I am a female is another illusion. So it is founded on illusory self-concept.

**Key Quote:** "To say that I am a male is first illusion, to say that I am a female is another illusion."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that attraction between male and female is based on the false ego and illusory self-concept, originating from the body rather than the soul.

That means illusory self-concept is called false ego. Self-concept is ego. Illusory self-concept is called false ego. So it is based on false ego. So therefore you know, you don't have to think that if a man feels towards a woman something, he doesn't have to feel, is my soul feeling, I am little doubtful, is it the soul feeling or the body feeling? It must be my soul's feeling. Soul is in love with nothing. All originated from body only. Soul is only a kshetrajna. So soul is knowing that, is feeling that I am feeling, to be a woman or a man. So these fine things to come out of this illusion,

**Summary:** The speaker states that overcoming illusion is difficult but can be made easier by associating with the holy name, which is the source of true knowledge and allows us to see with the eyes of intelligence rather than being deceived by Maya's expertise.

it is not easy. Not at all easy, but it is very easy if we associate with the holy name, because it is the source of all knowledge and knowledge means not information. I am not the body, information at the intellectual level you can have. Knowledge means perception. You don't see what your eyes sees. You see with the eyes of intelligence. If you look at the, with what the eyes sees, it look like gold. Similarly if you look just at what the eyes sees, then okay, because Maya is expert in her job, it look like such is Ananda body only, male, female, everybody.

But I cannot see what my eyes sees, I should see what my shastra tells to see, yes, yes, this is a duplication of, this skin deep, all male, female, everybody is skin deep only. Skin deep false personality. The real personality is, is sitting inside and is, and is haunted by this bodily concept of life. So even a karmi when he is speaking, who is speaking? Soul is speaking. That sense. Speaking means not, soul is experiencing that speaking. But it is speaking in a haunted manner. Suppose you are haunted, how will you speak? You will, haunted means at the identity level, a little replacement has happened. Suddenly you say okay now, so and so suddenly gets haunted. He is not the same person, you will see. Somebody else gets into your body and he utilizes the body. That is called, haunting.

Exactly the same way. This false ego, this haunting goes to the problem. Body is not a problem, for spiritualists. Body is not a problem, body can be used in Krishna's service. This ghost, comes into the body, enjoys, afterwards it goes away. Where it goes away? Into the memory. Then your normal self will come. Hey, why did I indulge in this? I should not have. Who is talking now? What happened? Earlier who indulged? Somebody else came inside and indulged. Aiyaram, Gayaram, they said. You know, fly by night operators are called Aiyaram, Gayaram. Suddenly they will come open on business, collect all monies, and suddenly shop is closed. It disappeared, with everybody's money. So all these sense gratificatory, false egos are all like, fly by night operators. They will come in the night, and then they will go away, afterwards. Then you wake up for Mangalarati.

**Key Quote:** "I am a person, capable of thinking, feeling and willing. I am not a male person, I am not a female person, I am a person."
**Summary:** The speaker advises disassociating from the concepts of male and female, focusing on being a person capable of thinking, feeling, and willing, and ultimately identifying as a servant of Krishna, utilizing the body in His service, which is the essence of Bhagavad Dharma.

looted and went away? So this approach we should take, this identification should not be there. To remove, to deal with false ego over many many years, you should start disassociating with this concept of I am a male, I am a female, that concept itself. That's not. I am a person, capable of thinking, feeling and willing. I am not a male person, I am not a female person, I am a person. First you are a person. What is the characteristic of a person? Somebody who can think, feel and will. Then you get color of a male or a female onto the person. Is it not? So pure person means, I am thinking, feeling, willing. I am a person who is servant of Krishna. Even in gross, gross bodily concept also you can be there. But as long as you remember that I am, this body is servant of Krishna. I am this body, I am the servant of Krishna, no problem. As long as you, just like in the spiritual body, in the spiritual world also, you have a spiritual body. So about this body, that's why you, why do we think we put all the Vaishnava, Tilak all over the body? Because you see we are treating this body like Sachidananda body. That means like in this spiritual world I have hands, I have to use my hands to serve Krishna. So here I have this body, hand is there, I have to use for serving Krishna. So having a body is not a handicap for real Vaishnavas, whereas impersonalists and mayavadis, this is a big problem. For them it's, you know, no form, no fame, no qualities for the body, for the person has no qualities, no thinking, no feeling, no willing. Ultimately I have to eliminate thinking, feeling and willing, I have to become pure awareness, they say. For us pure awareness is a foundation. Then we have got pure senses, we have got pure body, we have got pure activity, pure services in the spiritual world, in the Vaikunthallam. And that is what we learn from Srimad Bhagavatam, that is Bhagavad Dharma. Dharma of personality and...

**Summary:** The speaker asks how to maintain a missionary zeal without being influenced by Rajoguna and false ego, especially in light of Srila Prabhupada's gratitude to his Purvacharyas.

Hare Krishna, Prabhu. You had mentioned that we have to work with a missionary zeal. So, in my conditioned stage, I will be working more in like a Rajoguna, doubt-telling. Doubt-telling the Rajoguna. So, whereas you had mentioned that, you know, even Srila Prabhupada also has always attributed his success to his Purvacharyas.

**Key Quote:** "Even though He is in charge of the mode of ignorance in this material world, He is unaffected by any of the modes of material nature."
**Summary:** Lord Shiva is described as being in charge of the mode of ignorance but detached from material nature, engaged in service to the Supreme Lord, which is also the spirit of Vaishnavas.

The position of Lord Shiva is that He is in charge of all the living entities in the mode of ignorance. He takes care of them for their material desires. Those who are inflicted by the three modes of material nature, at every opportunity they are trying to get material pleasure for their body, for their mind, for their intellect, for their false ego. Even though He is in charge of the mode of ignorance in this material world, He is unaffected by any of the modes of material nature. He is exemplified by His detachment from this material world. He never accepts luxurious dress, garland, ornament, etc. He is engaged in His own Self. Only one who is engaged in His own Self can actually be free from the three modes of material nature. He understands His own Self as part and parcel, as part of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Knowing that, He is always engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is the spirit of the Vaishnavas also.

When he does Ashwamedha Yajna, he is engaging all the Karmiminded citizens. They are the one who are organizing, doing everything. Otherwise, one would ask why Prithu Maharaj is doing fructive activities. He should be teaching them devotional service, being an empowered incarnation of the Lord. The point is that for the living entities who are in different stages of their spiritual evolution in this material world, larger part of the material world, they are all Karmis. And good Karmis means who engage in Karma according to Guru, Sadhu and Shastra for material Artha, Kama, Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha.

A broader conception of Karma, we can see that even today, people have to go to work, they have to go through very many hardships. Hmm? Yes. Hardships means Tapasa, hmm? All the Tapasa that, Tapas, without Tapas, even this world cannot run now. Maybe it is Ugra Karma, but there is Tapas and that is why they get result, fruity result.

Yajna, Dhana, Thapa, different kinds of sacrifices are there, different kinds of sacrifices please the Supreme Lord. Okay? Yes. Yes.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of performing actions as a sacrifice to Krishna (yajna artha karma) and highlights Krishna's role in the material world and the nature of His enjoyment.

So work as a sacrifice, yajna artha karma, yajna artha karma. Everybody has to do yajna artha karma. But in this Kali Yuga, nobody is doing yajna artha karma. They are simply doing karma. So still, that karma, that sacrifice, that impersonal sacrifice does produce some result and that also Krishna calculates, seated in the heart as a super soul and gives their phala. This is the way the material world is running. So therefore, Krishna, He is the Parama Purushottama. Supreme Ishwara and His expansion as a super soul in the material world, as the father of all the living entities, aham vija prajapita, father of all living entities. He is supplying everyone according to their work. This is His arrangement. So in this material world, Krishna, He is the one who gives the phala. So in this material world, Krishna, He is the one who gives the phala. He is the one who gives the phala. The Purushottama, the Parama Ishwara, He is in this material world as the Supreme Ishwara of this material world. So this material world is running according to the scheme of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to give opportunity for unlimited living entities to be free to do what they want according to their karma. Or, they are free. Potentially. Potentially, if they are free to simply engage in devotional service of the Lord, that means to keep Krishna as the center of all their activities, Krishna's pleasure as a center of all their activities, Krishna as the center of, as the enjoyer of all the activities. Krishna's enjoyment is not like our enjoyment. Super Souls' enjoyment is not like our enjoyment. Super Souls' enjoyment is not like our enjoyment.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore when we chant Hare Krishna, it gives pleasure to Krishna. It gives pleasure to Krishna because we are sadhakas and we are taking his name."
**Summary:** This segment explains that chanting Hare Krishna pleases Krishna, and that the sound produced becomes Shakti Avesha, ultimately non-different from Krishna.

Supersoul's enjoyment is in his own standards. What is his standard? When the living entities performs Sankirtanayajna, Lord is pleased for us. Because Lord is completely self-sufficient, fully. When we say we please the Lord, we have to understand that Lord is an ocean of pleasure. And his pleasure from devotional service of his devotees, especially in this material world, is that of the pleasure of the children coming back to the right path. This gives him pleasure. Therefore when we chant Hare Krishna, it gives pleasure to Krishna. It gives pleasure to Krishna because we are sadhakas and we are taking his name. We are taking advantage of his pleasure. This is Avatara, Shakti Avesha. Now Avatara, the sound that we produce with our tongue becomes the Shakti Avesha. Avatara, not only living entities become Shakti Avesha, even sound, even matter sound produced by us with our tongue, it becomes Shakti Avesha. Just see. And then that sound, as long as all the Shakti, Satya, Chittan, Ananda Shakti enters that sound, it's no longer material sound. Nothing matter remains when Sat Chit Ananda, pure Sat Chit Ananda – Avesha enters the sound. So all matter disappears in that sense. No material qualities exist in the sound. In this material world – Hare Krishna, Rama. No material thing, material effect or three gunas exist in the sound. Similarly, no three gunas exist in the Archa-vigraha where the matter-vigraha is Sat-Chit-Ananda-Ist by the Avesha of that Shakti along with the Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan is there as a person who is incarnated. Similarly, Shakti Avesha Nama, Krishna's Nama in the spiritual world, Shuddha Nama is a Vekthi, is non-different from Krishna. The Nama persona of Krishna is same as Krishna.

So Nama 100%, Rupa Krishna, Nama Krishna all same, Leela Krishna all 100% same. Same Vekthi. In different aspects. So this Nama, Shuddha Nama of the spiritual world, Krishna's Rupa is there in the spiritual world. Similarly, Krishna's Nama is there in the spiritual world. Everything is eternal. So Krishna's Nama is eternally vibrating in the spiritual world. That eternally vibrating Nama in the spiritual world. He takes Avatara, He enters the sound uttered by us. First He enters as the Shakti. We are not qualified to directly even relate with the Shuddha Nama. Therefore first Shakti comes. The Shakti comes, bathes us, purifies us, cleans us, awakens a bit of our Bhakti towards Krishna. To that degree our chanting also keeps Him. To that degree our chanting also keeps Him. So it is the same. elevating its quality, first touching the Shakti, getting purified by realizations, by Sat realization, Chitta realization, Ananda realization. So gradually by Ananda realization we give up all taste for Jadananda or bogus, fake, cheating, false, imitation Anandas of this material world of love, sense pleasure, power, everything. There is a full realization in the devotees by the mercy or the flow of Sat Chitta Ananda of the entire cheating game and how then there is realization of how I am the loser in this material world, what I am entitled to is pure Sat Chitta Ananda, what I am entitled to in association with

Krishna. He is pure Sat Chitta Ananda.

So all these Asat, Achitta, Nirananda which is, which is, faking as Sat Chitta Ananda in this material world are like glass pieces, which look like a diamond, especially if it is cut nicely. Nowadays there are American diamonds, they look like diamonds, right? So similarly all these Asat, Achitta and Ananda are doing the dance of being Sat Chitta and Ananda. And then the living entity is attracted. And then it is attracted, what happens? Just like a firefly, or insects, they are attracted towards fire, right? Their own insects come, they go, so much attraction, immediately burns itself, suicide. So actually, when we are trying to enjoy this material world, my spirit, soul is committing suicide. Of course, soul is eternal, but at least for the time being, now we are all committed suicide. When somebody commits suicide, what does he get? A ghost body, right? So we are all got this ghost body. This is not our body, it is a ghost

Even when he has got externally, bodily, everything, so many sufferings, that he has got an internal antasukha, happiness. That I am directly under the shelter of Hari. I am chanting his holy name. Everything that is happening for me is for something for me to benefit from. I should learn from. He is so happy. So kind. My Supreme Lord seated in my heart. He is teaching me so many things. Personally teaching. External Guru and internal Guru.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of understanding Krishna's ego and compassion as revealed in the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting Vasudeva as the source of transcendental knowledge.

The one who is within and without as the Paramatma, Parameshwara in this material world, that is Vasudeva. Before Bhagavatam we say Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. It is he who is the source of all transcendental knowledge, detachment. One who enlightens a conditioned soul. A conditioned soul into Krishna Consciousness is Vasudeva. And the spiritual master is the representative, external representative of Vasudeva. Predominantly our Krishna Consciousness is at present is, he is our relationship with Krishna as a speaker of Bhagavad Gita. He is guiding us how to go back to Godhead. What we should do, what we should not do. He declares he is the Ishwara. I am running this material world. My Prakriti is working everything. Prakriti Kriyamanani Gunaikarmani Sarvasha Ahankar Vimudatma Kartaham Nithi Vanyate My Adhyaksena Prakriti Suyatesa Chararcharam Hetunane Kaunteya Jagat Parivartate. Everything is going. How Vasudeva, Krishna is declaring. We should feel his ego. Understanding Bhagavad Gita means feel that person who is speaking. Feeling Vasudeva's ego. Divine ego. All loving ego. All merciful ego. In the material world ego means all, you know, something about negativities, right? We should feel Krishna's ego. Divine ego. What is the nature of his divine ego? All loving ego. All compassionate. Entire material creation is from that ego of the Lord. Of wanting to show his compassion on those who want to go back to him. And show compassion on those who want, do not want him also. Including giving them chance to abuse him.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of accepting the Bhagavad Gita as it is to understand Sanatana Dharma and highlights Hari as the one who removes misery and cleanses us from sin.

He is the one who is seated in the heart and giving the power to abuse him. Only those who accept Bhagavad Gita as it is. Only those who accept Krishna's words as it is in Bhagavad Gita. They understand what is Sanatana Dharma. Because he has covered everything. He has covered Devatas, Demigods, Sacrifice. Everybody is covered. Everything he has covered. Who is the Supreme? Everything he has covered. Hmm? Prabhupada says Supreme Ishwara Purusha Uttama is Lord Krishna. He exhibits his powers as Ishwara or the Supreme Controller when he assures his devotee in Bhagavad Gita. Just see. Abandon all varieties of religion. This is not being spoken by Goloka Krishna. Please understand. The Prabhupada is clarifying here. Supreme Ishwara Purusha Uttama is Lord Krishna. He exhibits power as Ishwara or the Supreme Controller when he assures his devotee in Bhagavad Gita. Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear. Hari will reciprocate. Hari as a Supreme Controller will reciprocate. Will reciprocate. Generally Hari you can say as the word God. English word God we say actually Hari. Because Hari does not say which God. Whether it is Sridhar Chahavishnu or whether it is Rama. They are all called Hari. All their names are called Hari Nama. All of them have the common nature of burning all our sin. Cleaning us. Burning our sinful reactions and removing our miserable conditions.

All living entities are miserable in this material world. For some time things all go well and everybody is jumping and dancing. When he jumps and dances he forgets next he has to jump into the fire.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of chanting Hare Krishna devotionally, especially in the early morning, to experience the reciprocation of Radha and Krishna and the need to surrender our attention to the Lord.

Therefore Prabhupada says always chant Hare Krishna. Immediately coming out of the heart into the sound. Just like Krishna. Adhyatam, Achyutam, Anadyam, Anantaroopam. Similarly is Nama also. Adhyatam, Achyutam, Anadyam, Anantaroopam. In the midst of your devotional service you chant Hare Krishna. Then that is Vasudeva. Vasudeva is coming for you. Early morning you are chanting Hare Krishna, Hare. Nicely. Devotionally. Exclusively. Hearing. Not thinking of any other service. That time the Lord is reciprocating. As Radha and Krishna. Krishna, Hare, Supreme Hare, Supreme Hara, which is our goal. That is why it is not easy to lock your attention. As we become purer we will be able to lock our attention more and more. We should try to lock our attention. But nobody, Atashi, Krishna, Namadhi, Nabhavet, Grahya, Mindriye. Nobody can lock Krishna. You try to lock. And when he allows, it gets locked. That is why some devotees come and say, Prabhu, yesterday was very nice, I could lock my attention. Same thing I am trying today, nothing is happening. We should go on trying to lock our attention. It means surrender our 100% attention to him. We should. You take that step, then Krishna has to. We have to understand that Krishna has to allow for you to lock your attention on him.

**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of waterfalls and different types of soil to illustrate how the effectiveness of Hare Nama depends on our absorbing capacity and the purity of our devotion.

Hare Nama. It is not a small effect. You do one Sankirtana in the city, it is not a small effect. It is not about how many people are in the Sankirtana, how many people are chanting. It is vibrating that together, that Hare Nama. Where this many people vibrating together is heard. The chorus is heard by the conditioned living entity and by the entire atmosphere. Not only living, not only the human beings. All the, you know, animals, insects. Only human beings can hear sound? No. So many can hear sound. They all hear. So in large, you have to understand that Hare is so powerful. Hare Nama is so powerful. Krishna himself. Only our absorbing capacity is less. Like waterfalls, clay will not absorb so much. Nice soft mud will absorb. Sand will not absorb. Rock will not absorb. Rain is same. Hare Nama is same. Whether you chant, Karmi chants, anybody chants. Hare Nama is same. But this reciprocation depends upon what is your soil or a sponge or what you are. Like a sponge. A pure devotee is like a sponge. Full rain will get soaked in. On a rock it falls. Nothing goes in. It will just flow away. Nama Prada. Nama Prada is, it all goes away. Just goes away. Just goes away. But there it goes away. Flows away. He cannot take anything. Nothing changes in his life.

## The Purpose of the Varnashrama System in Society | Sri Madhu Pandit Dasa | SB 4.14.18 | 16.07.2024

### Varna and Ashrama, Duty, Devotional Service, Government's Role

**Key Quote:** "The state's duty and the citizens' duty are very nicely explained in this verse."
**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa reads and explains a verse and purport from Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing the importance of Varna and Ashrama for societal harmony and the government's role in ensuring citizens engage in devotional service.

Om Om Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 4, Chapter 14, Text 18. Canto 4, Chapter 14, Text 18. Translation: In Perpetual Vaisalaprabhupada Jaya, "The king is supposed to be pious in whose state and cities the general population strictly observes the system of eight social orders of Varna and Ashrama and where all citizens engage in worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead by their particular occupation." Purport: "The state's duty and the citizens' duty are very nicely explained in this verse. The activities of the government head or king as well as the activities of the citizens must be so directed that ultimately everyone engages in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The king or the government head is supposed to be representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is therefore supposed to see that things go on nicely and the citizens situated in the scientific social order comprise four Ashramas, four Varnas and four Ashramas. In the Vishnu Purana, it is stated that unless people are educated or situated in the scientific social order comprised of four Varnas, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra, then four Ashramas, Brahmacharya, Grahastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa, society can never be considered real human society nor can it make any advancement towards the ultimate goal of human life. It is the duty of the government to see that things go on in terms of Varna and Ashrama. As stated here in Bhagavan Etnapurusha, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna is the Etnapurusha. As stated in Bhagavad Gita, Bhaktaram, Yajna Tapasam, Krishna is the ultimate purpose of all sacrifice. He is also the enjoyer of all sacrifices. Therefore, he is known as Etnapurusha. The word Etnapurusha indicates Lord Vishnu or Lord Krishna or any personality of Godhead in the category of Vishnu Tattva. In perfect human society, people are situated in the orders of Godhead. They follow the orders of Varna and Ashrama and are engaged in worshipping Lord Vishnu by their respective activities. Every citizen engaged in an occupation renders service by the resultant actions of his activities. That is the perfection of life. As stated in Bhagavad Gita, yatah pravrttir bhuthanam ena sarvam idam tatam swakarmanatam abhyarchya siddhim vindati manavah: By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection. Thus, the Brahmana Kshatriya Vaishya Shudras must execute their prescribed duties as these duties are stated in the Shastras. In this way, everyone can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu. The king or the government head has to see that the citizens are thus engaged. In other words, the state or the government must not deviate from its duty by declaring that state is a secular state, which has no interest in whether or not the people advance in Varna Ashrama. Today, people engage in government service and people who rule over the citizens have no respect for Varna Ashrama Dharma. They complacently feel that the state is secular. In such a government, no one can be happy. People must follow the Varna Ashrama Dharma and the king must see that they follow it nicely." Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport.

**Key Quote:** "Varna Ashrama system of social organization of human society is a system of social organization meant for civilized human beings."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Varna Ashrama system as a foundation for civilized society, highlighting its role in elevating consciousness and the importance of adhering to one's designated division of labor.

So, the duty of the king and that of the citizens is explained here by the great sages to King Vena. As we have been discussing, Varna Ashrama system of social organization of human society is a system of social organization meant for civilized human beings. A civilized human being by following the Varna Ashrama system, he elevates himself into higher states of consciousness. The Varna Ashrama system becomes more abundant, by nationalizing inbuttocks and nuevos and opportunities. Vendra and Sahaja Yoga promote a realized life under the guidance of Varna Ashrama. Vendra and Sahaja Yoga. This civilization, of course, has collapsed. Our Indian civilization was based on this division of labor among different citizens. And then the king's duty is to see that the system does not break. Everyone stays in his division of labor, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishudhra.

**Key Quote:** "Even if he follows this system set up by the Lord, even though he doesn't recognize, but he's part of such a Varna Ashrama society, he will accumulate a lot of Punya."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the accumulation of Punya (merit) through adherence to the Varna Ashrama system, even without devotional intent, and its potential consequences, such as attaining heavenly planets.

And this was the duty of the Kshatriya king. And if the population... Okay. He simply lives according to his Varna and Ashrama. He would accumulate a lot of Punya because he is obedient to the system set up by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if somebody is not... Okay. A devotee of the Lord. But if he follows this system set up by the Lord, even though he doesn't recognize, but he's part of such a Varna Ashrama society, he will accumulate a lot of Punya. And accumulating a lot of Punya, what is the result? The next life they will live in a different way. Okay. They will go to the heavenly planets to enjoy the results of those Punyas. Heavenly planets is packed with enjoyment because that is a place to encash your Punya that you have performed in the human body. Okay. So that particular thing of the population thinking that if I am following the Varna Ashrama system, I will get a good life, next life to heavenly planets, has no connection

**Key Quote:** "Devotion service is when you recognize that I am part of the Varna Ashrama system that is designed by the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes between simply following Varna Ashrama for material benefits and engaging in Daivya Varna Ashrama, where the goal is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, contrasting it with the Karma Mimamsa philosophy.

with devotion service. Devotion service is when you recognize that I am part of the Varna Ashrama system. Okay. So, I am part of the Varna Ashrama system that is designed by the Lord. And I live my life in strict obedience to the will of the Lord who has designed this Varna Ashrama system. So that is devotion service. That is called Daivya Varna Ashrama system. In that Varna Ashrama is not that, you know, Daivya Varna Ashrama system, Vishnu is the Ejna Purusha. My living as a Brahmana, Kshatriya in the society, everything is for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So that is how the great Indian civilization was. And even at that time. It's not that if Varna Ashrama is there, everybody is a devotee. No. Large part of people who are in Varna Ashrama, they are following because they want to enjoy. And in case they are ignorant and they do not follow the orders of the social system, then they go down in their material life into another form. Okay. They go down in their material life into another form of life. The lower systems, lower. So Krishna's purpose of Varna Ashrama, karma khandis may misuse it. There's a philosophy called karma mimamsa. It's always there. Just like Vaishnavism, that's always there. There's a philosophy called karma mimamsa. It's always there. They say where is the need for Vishnu. They say where is the need for Vishnu. If I do my karma, I will go to heavenly planet. So, I have to strictly follow the law of karma. If I want to elevate myself to greater enjoyment, they have no concept of pleasing Vishnu by following the laws of Karma.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly, people know that if I do Punya, then I will enjoy my life."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of atheistic scientists utilizing the laws of electromagnetism, the speaker explains how people can benefit from the Varna Ashrama system and the laws of karma without necessarily being devotees, emphasizing the importance of division of labor in society.

Okay. But still, they know. See, just like to use the laws of material nature, you don't have to be devotees. Atheists, atheistic scientists, they utilize the law of electromagnetism. They don't think of Vishnu. Similarly, people know that if I do Punya, then I will enjoy my life. Not Punya to please the Supreme Lord. Certain acts are Punya. If I do that, I will get… material nature has to give me result. Just like if I know the laws of electromagnetism, it has to give result. Lord is not directly connected with it. He has set up a system. Same way, the Varnashama system is also like that. So, we have to understand that we are for Daivya Varnashama system, where Krishna is the center of the activities, the activities of Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra. And they execute these duties being situated in one of the Ashramas. Because there also, how to exist, what is the lifestyle is given. What is the lifestyle of a Brahmana? What is the lifetime of a Kshatriya? What is the lifestyle of a Shudra, a Vaishya? First one is the division by labor. Then a society needs intelligentsia, needs administration, needs economic activity and needs people to work with their hands and legs.

**Key Quote:** "Varanashrama system is for civilized human being. Because they are disciplined."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Ashramas are about lifestyle and that the Varna Ashrama system is for civilized human beings because they are disciplined, and laments the destruction of Vedic civilization and the lack of knowledge about Varna Ashrama even among Hindus.

So, we have, these are all division of labor: Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. And this Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, as per the system, they should execute their respective duties, staying under a particular lifestyle. So, Ashramas are about lifestyle. So, the entire human society, why we say civilized? Varanashrama system is for civilized human being. Because they are disciplined. They stay within an Ashrama. And they perform their respective duties as per their Varna. So, in this way, society also will be, everybody performs their part. The human society also will be harmonious. So, these Varanashrama principles are all given in our Shastras. In Mahabharata, when Bhishma was lying on the bed of arrows, most of his instructions was on the Varanashrama. But we know all now that a normal human being, even if he is a Hindu, he does not know this at all. He does not know what is Varanashrama. So, our Vedic civilization has been destroyed. As far as goal of life is concerned, there is no difference between an Indian and an American or a European. No connection with Sanatana Dharma.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Sanatana Dharma with Western civilization, which he characterizes as body-centered and hedonistic, and expresses concern about the influence of Western culture on the Indian population and the degradation of India's traditional values.

Our country as an association, our country's origin, the origin of Sanatana Dharma is from our country. See how much the Indian population has been the victim of another civilization, the Western civilization. And the Western civilization is totally body-centered, hedonistic, that means enjoy life, immediate life in this body. Forget. They have no idea of another next life they have. So, that is what today Indians also, they have no idea of what is next life, that there is next life, which is a very obvious factor to everyone. So, unless you know that you are not this body, there is a meaning of next life. If you think you are the body, the body dies, you die. This is the value of the Western society. No spiritual value. Because spirit is not recognized. So, it is very shocking that the entire Bharat, which had a civilization of Varanashrama, for millions of years, it has degraded only in Kali Yuga. In Kali Yuga also, it has degraded only later on,

due to the foreign rule. People were prosperous, happy under Varanashrama system. What was India's condition? Even 200 years back, when the Britishers ruled, a newspaper cutting of 1835, I will read. Nikolai, who was a British minister in India, in charge of education. And, any of you have that clipping? You have to search it in this. Okay. Here it is. Lord Nikolai addresses the British Parliament on 2nd February, 1835. This is 1835 newspaper cutting. So, what speaks in the British Parliament? "I have traveled across the length and breadth of India. And, I have not seen one person who is a beggar or who is a thief. Such wealth I have seen in this country. Such high moral values. People of such caliber that I do not think we would ever conquer this country unless we break the very backbone of this nation, which is our spiritual and cultural heritage. And, therefore, I propose that we replace her old and ancient education system, her culture. For, if Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good, and greater than their own, they will lose their self-esteem, their entire, their native culture. They will lose their native culture. And, they will become what we want them, a truly dominated nation."

You see, huh? So, it is this person who reported to the British Parliament. And, British Parliament approved his plan to dismantle the Gurukula system in the entire country. The Gurukula system where the proper Vedic cultural education was happening. And, they replaced it with this modern school system that we have now. Such a deep and highly valued system of education for human society, for human being, has just been destroyed. We should know all these things, historically. Exactly, they failed. Anything that is English is great. Anything that is English is good. It's all brainwashing done over hundred years. Your children are studying in English school. High value. Even today. Huh? And, people are shy to talk about their culture. Huh? If you take... If you go and stand today and, you know, speak. Indian leaders speak. They don't talk one bit about the culture or anything. Because, they're shy. They don't speak. We cannot talk all these things. Then, you are not educated. You should talk like a Westerner. You should talk Western culture. You should talk Western system. Very deep it is. We were all part of that. That conditioning is so deep. Even now, our conditioning doesn't go.

So, this is a story of India 189 years back. Big damage done to our country. So, that is why it is very important that gradually, these things have to come back into the society. They introduce English education. And, you see how everything goes 180 degrees, 360 degrees. It comes back. Now, Prabhupada's books are in English language. Now, we are reading this Prabhupada's book in English. In that English language which they, you know, brought into India to destroy our culture. Now, very same English language, Prabhupada is translating this wonderful literature, Vedic literature. Now, we are talking in English. We are hearing in English about Varnashrama Dharma. How to, how to bring back Varnashrama Dharma. So, the Lord is in control, ultimately. So, we preach in English. See how important Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati's instruction to Srila Prabhupada. He says, speak to English speaking world. English speaking people. Preach to English speaking people. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati clearly knew, even in India, ultimately everybody will be English educated.

Any questions? Hare Krishna, Prabhu. So, Prabhu, you said one thing that how the Lord Macaulay told that unless they feel that whatever is English is superior and whatever they are doing is inferior, we cannot conquer the Indian people. So, and then, as we heard that, how our Acharyas, they, using the same English language, is, they are preaching about Krishna Consciousness, Varnashrama. So, that is one way that is, that is happening, that has happened very nicely. So, should we also, side by side, just like, I remember hearing one lecture or some, reading some book, Prabhupada is saying that we should also convince the Western people that their culture is actually not superior, it is inferior. So, just like Macaulay thought that unless we Indians think that we are inferior, our culture is inferior, we cannot conquer them. So, should we also preach that no, actually, our culture is superior and, I mean, actually, I think that, that only happened that how Prabhupada proved them that your culture is inferior and, so that's how to change the culture. That's the way to prove that

they are inferior? No. See, Prabhupada, he told the foundation of our culture. He gave knowledge. Every culture is based on some knowledge. Western culture is based on Western knowledge. Okay, similarly, Indian culture is based on Vedic knowledge. So, Prabhupada went, Prabhupada and our Acharyas, Bhaktivedanta wrote in English, Bhaktivinoda Thakur wrote in English, many things. They went to the foundation of culture and showed that your foundation is shallow, body-centered culture. Ours is spirit-centered culture. Does not matter, Vaishnavism, Mayavadism, Impersonalism, Chodavism, all of them agree spirit. Spirit-centered culture, we are. Spirit-centered culture, spirit-centered culture is greater because you are spirit. Body-centered culture means you are only caring for your life, birth to death. The moment spirit-centered culture means I never die, I am eternal, soul is eternal. So, my welfare means eternal welfare, not my interest in this life, short term. So, that is the difference between, you know, they had a very devious means of dominating. So, we don't have the concept of dominating and then introducing, for that purpose, introducing spiritual culture. So, some of these, our leaders have got it right when they say that we are not aggressors. You see, China is thinking one day the whole world should be China. America is thinking, Russia is thinking. So, they are always thinking how to accumulate more and more power. Conquer means what? Control. So, practically, you know, America is known to be the most powerful nation, was known, the most powerful country. So, see the spirit of, political spirit of those countries is to control the rest of the world. India is not aggressive to capture more and more geographical areas that they are controlling. That is not, India's thing is to spread spiritual culture. For the benefit of their own self, come to Sanatana Dharma. You are short-sighted about your own existence. Just because you have forgot, you, just because you have body-centered culture, doesn't mean you are not a soul. The truth is that you are spirit. And spirit-centered is Varnashma Dharma.

**Key Quote:** "Make best of the bad bargain."
**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges the westernization of modern India but emphasizes the importance of Prabhupada's books in providing access to Vedic knowledge, which was previously inaccessible due to the destruction of the Gurukula system and Sanskrit education, and highlights the role of temples in preserving Sanatana Dharma.

So, the modern world is fully, modern India is fully westernized. But doesn't matter. Make best of the bad bargain. As we see here, these wonderful books of Srila Prabhupada. If Prabhupada hadn't translated these books and all, we all would not have become devotees at all. Where do we have Sanskrit? Where do we have Sanskrit? They have broken Sanskrit, no? Once Gurukul system is destroyed, Sanskrit education is broken. And all our knowledge is coming from where? Is written in what language? Sanskrit. So, the Sanskrit translation of these things, we get to appreciate, Oh God, this is not some mythology. Because moment you become educated, after some time you start seeing, because you have no explanation. What is this worship? What is this? What is this? All this ritual? What is this? You know explanation. And when you don't have an explanation, they will come and put, these are all mythologies. These are all superstitions. And they make a joke of all this. So, the Indian educated person, Vedas. Stay away. There is nothing in it. There is ritual, there is superstition. Actually, this was, in my younger days, in college days, this was among all the youths. But it has changed now. So, some positive things are happening in this country now. In my younger days, in my college, somebody came with book distribution, Bhagavad Gita, if they had come. And if all the, my friends are all there. And they come. If I buy, they'll all laugh. They'll laugh. Now it's different. Things have changed. Had zero value for Indian culture. Only our older generations, our parents were the, I think, the last. Then, the next generation became the parents they don't know ABC. They don't know our culture is based on Bhagavad Gita. Some Hindu way of worshipping is there, okay, worship Krishna, worship. So, in fact, it is these places of worship in India, these temples that have kept alive the culture. Kept alive Sanatana Dharma.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the approaches of the Mughals and the British in ruling India, with the Mughals aiming for cultural assimilation through intermarriage and the British focusing on looting the country, and mentions the Ghar Wapsi program aimed at bringing people back to their Hindu roots.

But, the Mughals, they knew that, Mughals had a different idea. Britishers' idea was to loot India and take there. Mughals' idea is to come here and make India theirs. Mughal kings. They would conquer, they will kill the men, and they will marry the Indian women. And they are allowed, so many wives married. Then they create, you know, more generations. So, if you see every, you know, Indian Muslim, origin you will go to a Hindu, Hindu mother. You will go. You will reach there. So, that is why they say Garh Vapsi. RSS has a program, Garh Vapsi. They don't say, we are converting you back. Come back. You come back to what you were. Back to home.

Any other question? Prabhu, so, I think, so as, now we have received this knowledge, so we should, I mean, not be shy and boldly actually practice. And, just like Prabhupada said, there are two kinds of Bhagavata: Book Bhagavata, person Bhagavata. So, I think it's, it's very important to also become person Bhagavata. So that, the face of the world can change. I mean, it's right, I think. What's the question? Question is that we should not become shy just like sometimes we are taught to be humble. But, while preaching, we should be bold facing the people. We should speak out with conviction. More than bold. Should speak with conviction. We should be convinced of these truths. We should have realization of these truths. We're not simply speaking from some book. These are all facts. These are all the unseen reality. Spirit is the unseen reality. Any other question?

Lord is unmanifest everywhere; everywhere He is there. Avatara means He is manifest in the material element. So we have to make people chant so that we manifest the Lord in our dimension. On Hare Krishna hill, in Rajaji Nagar, in this particular address, with ordinary ears, with ordinary tongue, material tongue and material ears, we are able to touch the avatar of the Lord. Thousands of people are coming to this temple. They are also adding, they are not only benefiting themselves by going through the chanting mantap, they are contributing to the welfare of the entire Bangalore city. How do we understand? These things you have to see from the perspective of the scriptures. This is a kripa of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Our perception towards this sound should be that of directly associating with Krishna in his sound vigraha."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of Avatara Shabdha, emphasizing that devotional service to the Lord's sound incarnation allows direct association with Krishna.

Hara is the seed of the Mahamantra. You can see the sound of the Mahamantra by the sound that is made up of the Mahamantra. Even the material, the sense of the Mahamantra, the sounds or the sound of the Mahamantra is made up of those 10 Signs. These are the three, and the names of these Four. Hara. Hara. Hara. To understand that we are doing the seva, we are offering devotional service to the Lord's Avatara Shabdha. In the Avatara Shabdha, the Avatari, one who is taking Avatara is present with all his Shaktis. Our perception towards this sound should be that of directly associating with Krishna in his sound vigraha. Mantra murti, the Supreme Lord is omnipotent. He can come into this material world in the physical form like 5,000 years back, or He can come online in the sound that you and me chant because he is omnipotent. So it is revealed in the scriptures, Kali Kale Nama Rupe Krishna Avatara.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna himself is becoming that sound and entering the sound that we chant."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is present in his holy names, emphasizing the importance of faith in the scriptures and the concept of the self-sounding sound entering the sound we chant, bringing all his shaktis with it.

So Krishna himself is present in his holy names. The more you have faith in the statement of the Shastra, the more you will feel the presence of Krishna before you. Therefore this is, this aspect of seeing the sound, but the perspective of the Shastra is called Shraddha. Because to your ears, it is, to the plain ears, it is sounding like an ordinary sound. But it is not. Krishna, it's a sound, Krishna himself has become that sound. It's a self-sounding sound. Hear properly, self-sounding sound. Hear properly. When I make a noise here, this is not a self-sounding sound. It's a sound that is produced out of clatter of matter, one matter hitting the other matter. Or the air molecules are moving and therefore sound is produced. Yes, the sound I chant, it is produced out of the air molecules. But into that sound enters the self-sounding sound. And who is the self that is sounding that sound? In Krishna's name, Krishna himself. So Krishna himself is becoming that sound and entering the sound that we chant. It's called Avatara. Yes. The sound that I produce with my material tongue is called, is the Avatara Sharira. Into that Avatara Sharira, the Krishna's self-sounding sound, his names enter that sound. When he enters that sound, all his shaktis also enter. Therefore, the sound that we chant with our tongue becomes Shakti Avesha Avatara.

**Key Quote:** "He comes as the shaktiavesha nama shabda, shabda avatara, so that with our material senses, the tongue and the ears, we can access, tangibly touch Krishna through chanting and hearing."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how the sound we chant becomes Shakti Avesha Avatara, allowing us to access Krishna through our material senses, and how ignorance covers our true nature of Sat Chitta Ananda.

All the Shaktis, infinite Shaktis, it depends on how much we are able to draw that Shakti from the Shakti Avesha Nama. Shakti means Sat Shakti, Chitta Shakti, Ananda Shakti, pure spiritual Shakti. We are trapped in this material world, in these material bodies because of ignorance, forgetfulness of my Swaroopa, my… what is my real Swaroopa, what is my real substance? My substance is not this body of flesh and bones. My substance is Sat Chitta Ananda. I remove the coverings of asat achit nirananda, jadananda, unless those coverings are removed, my surupa, my real surupa, which is sacchidananda, cannot be realized. So the Lord is very kind. He comes as the shaktiavesha nama shabda, shabda avatara, so that with our material senses, the tongue and the ears, we can access, tangibly touch Krishna through chanting and hearing. Okay? And hearing requires mind.

**Key Quote:** "The sound becomes a omnipotent sound. That omnipotent sound is sent into our heart."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the role of the mind in hearing, how the omnipotent sound of Krishna's name enters our heart, burns away ignorance, and bestows transcendental knowledge.

So three senses are serving the shabda avatara, the chanting, the hearing and the mind. Without the mind, you cannot hear. Chanting you can mechanically chant. If your mind is, your attention is not on hearing, then you cannot hear. So hearing includes ears and mind. So Krishna comes down as his nama, into the namas that I utter. The sound becomes a omnipotent sound. That omnipotent sound is sent into our heart. Okay? And the omnipotency of that sound will burn to ashes all asat, all the lies, all the ignorance about my existence, I am this body, is a false self ego. It is not the real self ego. So it has to burn to ashes, the misunderstanding that I am this body. And that power is there in the satya shakti of the Lord. Chitta shakti gives us transcendental knowledge about the whole samyak jnana. Chitta shakti gives us transcendental knowledge about the whole samyak jnana. Let us look into this material world. Where am I suffering? Where am I always searching after happiness? Where is that happiness? The answers to all these questions becomes very, very clear when the chitta shakti of shakti avesha nama influences my heart. The Chit viewers, this authority, the eder in my greatest blessing, because today, I am moving forward backwards for development. Such Gunas should have no space in my heart.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Shakti Avesha Nama enters our ears, goes into our heart, purifies our heart first."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of wet wood drying in a fire, the speaker explains how the holy name purifies our heart, allowing us to realize our true nature of Satchidananda and awaken our Shuddha Chitta.

Samgava, Samgapura, V авyāwal. Like this Prabhupada gives example, iron put in the fire. Because of association of the fire, the energy of the fire is transferred to the iron and it becomes red hot. Warmer, warmer, warmer, then red hot. Similarly, our heart is now just like there is a wet wood. And you put it in the fire, will it catch fire immediately? No. What happens first? The fire will evaporate the water, the fire will make the wood dry and suddenly when the wood is fully dried, the firewood catches fire. In the same way, Shakti Avesha Nama enters our ears, goes into our heart, purifies our heart first. That purification is drying the wood. That is the reason why even though the Satchidananda Surya has entered my heart, why I am not in bliss? Because the firewood is wet. Don't worry. Something is happening. You are wet. That soul is getting dried. Dry means, a complete dry means completely free from sinful attitude, sinful tendencies, sinful reactions. Completely heart is free from that. Free from offenses. Then, after that, the very same holy name, with purified our heart, which acted as an Aushadi, will act as a tonic for my spirit soul to wake up. Right now, my Shuddha Chitta, I have a Shuddha Chitta, the spirit person. Beyond this Chitta, material Chitta and material body, there is Shuddha Chitta. The Atma has got Shuddha Chitta. And that is where, the realization that, I am eternal servant of Krishna. I belong to Krishna. I love Krishna. Krishna loves me. Everything is situated in that Chitta, Shuddha Chitta. That Shuddha Chitta will catch fire. Then, my consciousness will become also, Satchitananda.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the Lord's mercy in descending as the holy name to purify us, awaken our spiritual senses, and ultimately take us back to Godhead, leading to detachment from illusion and attachment to Krishna.

So, this is the process. So mercifully, the Lord has come down, in order to save us, from this ignorance of this material world, material life. And, this Nama, Divya Nama of Krishna, will purify us, and then take us back to Godhead. Purify us, not only purify, purify means removing the dirt. That is not enough. My real spiritual mind and spiritual senses have to be awakened. So, that also the Nama Prabhu does. After awakening my spiritual mind and spiritual senses, He is taking me to, directly to the spiritual world, to see Krishna face to face. For that, to see Krishna face to face, my Krishna Prema has to be awakened. My Preeti for Krishna has to be, my soul's Preeti for Krishna has to be awakened. We have awakened, little we have awakened, that's why we are in Krishna consciousness. But waking is a slow process, fully awakened is a different thing. So, when we are ready, then the holy name will give us everything. Total detachment, from illusion, and attachment towards, Krishna. So, coming to, practice of japa, soulful japa,

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of hearing the holy name for it to enter the heart, distinguishing it from ordinary sounds and emphasizing that Krishna descends into the sound, making it Avatara Shabda.

for all these things to happen, having heard, what I said, how it affects, how the change happens, the most important thing, to get the full benefit of the holy name, is to ensure that the holy name goes into your heart, and the only way the holy name can go into your heart, is, through hearing, the shakti, avesha, nama. You can chant any nonsense sound, and you can hear, nothing will happen to your heart, chai, chai, chai, chai, chai, in the railway station you can see, it doesn't get self-realized. Whole days, eight hours, ten hours you will chant, chai, chai, chai, chai, chai, chai, that shabda is clatter of, what? Air molecules. But Krishna, that shabda, Krishna has come. The limitless Satchidananda, ocean of Satchidananda is before you. So this is avatara shabda. All others are ordinary shabdas. This also, tongue, your tongue only produces this sound, like chai. But it becomes avatara shabda. Krishna's avatara sharira. And there's no difference between Krishna and any of his sharira, once he takes up, once he decides to descend. Associating with his avatara sharira,

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the role of shraddha (faith) in perceiving the Satchidananda present in the sound and introduces the concept of mindful japa, emphasizing the need to be aware of the mind's movements and anchor it to the holy name.

he is associating with avatari. So it all depends upon your shraddha. You see this sound with shraddha. What your eyes cannot see, what your ears cannot see, Satchidananda you cannot see with the materialized, material senses, but it is there. The surya of Satchidananda is there. So, first thing is, mindful japa. As I said, you cannot hear if the mind is not on the sound. That means mindful japa means you have to be mindful about your mind. What is mindful japa? You have to be mindful about your mind. Where is the mind? Usually we use our mind. When you use our mind, is one thing. Being mindful about using the mind is another thing. That means you have to watch. Mind has gone away from the holy name into thinking. Unless you are mindful, you cannot catch it and bring it back. So, mind has to be anchored. The rascal mind goes away into thinking. It has to be anchored, locked in the sound.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between thinking and feeling, advocating for feeling the presence of Krishna while chanting and hearing, and emphasizing that the primary task is hearing, not processing thoughts.

Mantra after mantra after mantra. So, locking the attention. Where you hear the chanting without thinking anything. Thinking is different. Thought is different. Thinking means you are processing thoughts. Chant and hear and feel. Feel the thought, Krishna is before me. Don't process. Process means you have a problem. You are thinking about that, how to solve that. That is one thing. Or process means you are analyzing the philosophy or of the holy name. No analyzing. Krishna is before me. It's a thought. Krishna is Surya of Satchitananda. It's a thought. So, thoughts with feeling should be there, but not thinking. Thinking means you are tasking something else. We think in order to task something, either problem solving or this or that. So, no other tasking than hearing.

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You have to take your attention and task your attention to move along with each word."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of 'tasking' during japa, explaining intra-mantra tasking (attention to each name within the mantra) and inter-mantra tasking (uninterrupted flow between mantras), comparing it to a yajna with repeated offerings.

Hearing means knowing the sound. Knowing the sound means you have to catch your mind and you have to task it. Means now Hare, Krishna, Hare, Krishna, Krishna, Hare, Hare. You have to know now which sound you are on. And you have to task. Task is a work, isn't it? You have to task your attention. You have to take your attention and task your attention to move along with each word. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Initially it sounds difficult, but our attention is very fine. Once you train your mind, on each sound it will run. As you are chanting, your attention will run with each sound. So that tasking, you cannot do that if you are thinking. Because then your thinking means your attention is on processing the thoughts. So mantra after mantra, you have to do tasking. Two kinds of tasking is there. One tasking is intra-mantra tasking. That means within the mantra there are sixteen names. You have to run your attention from first name to the last name. Then there is inter-mantra tasking. What is that? After you finish one mantra, no other thinking, but next mantra starts. Uninterrupted tasking. Then only it is a yajna. Yajna means repeated offering. Just like you pour one spoon of ghee, Swaha, Swaha, Swaha, Swaha. Similarly, on each bead is one Swaha, one Swaha, another. On each bead. On each bead there are sixteen spoons of ghee. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Swaha. This is the japa yajna.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that offering attention during japa is a valuable offering to Krishna, distinguishing it from mechanical chanting and highlighting the importance of a personal relationship with the Lord.

Tasking. You are tasking. The work that you are doing, taking the spoon, taking the what, ghee, putting it inside, uttering the mantra, isn't it? Similarly, this is a task of uttering the mantra and giving the attention. There you give ghee. In your other yajna, you give ghee. Here you offer attention. Attention is the most valuable energy of the soul. So Krishna wants that. That attention shakti is the most valuable. That is why mechanically you chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna. You go on chanting mechanically. Not very pleasing. It will help you. But attentively you chant. Give your attention and chant. Just like you call your son, call your daughter, you are calling with attention, no? Not mechanically. So call with attention, hear with attention, cry with attention, crying the names with attention. So this is very important that japa is to be understood to be tasking, not simply shravanam and kirtanam.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that japa is a yajna and a service that pleases Krishna because it purifies the soul and brings it closer to Him, emphasizing the personal relationship between the devotee and the Lord.

There is something else happening. Just chanting and hearing each mantra. You can say that is shravanam and kirtanam. No. There is an effort involved in offering our work. It's a work. I will not do any other work than chanting and hearing 16 into 108 malas. 108 into 16. I will not do anything else. This is a work I am going to do now. My yajna is this. And always have, when our japa stops being mechanical, when you know it is a relationship, Krishna has come down to receive my seva. Why my seva pleases Krishna? Not because he is waiting, he is starving, nobody is chanting my name, oh here one, let me go and catch that name. Krishna is pleased when you chant because now Krishna knows, my this soul is going to get purified and one more step it is, he is coming towards me. Every chanting pleases Krishna because every bead of japa will take us closer to Krishna and Krishna will never forget every extra bead of japa that you do. So it is pleasing to Krishna because Krishna loves each of the jivas and any attempt of the jivas to go back, he is pleased for us because we are going to stop suffering in this material world due to forgetfulness. Very soon this jiva is going to come to me

and Krishna is very happy with each of your calling and crying Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. So chanting and hearing and tasking, japa means tasking, chanting, hearing, tasking. What are the two kinds of tasking? Intra mantra chanting. Sounds very... Intra mantra tasking and then inter mantra chanting. That means you have a job to do within the chanting of one mantra and you have a job to do between the mantras. What is that? Push out every other thought and go jump to the next mantra, next mantra, next mantra. Unless you are determined, unless you are ready for this yajna, you will not succeed in hearing japa, pure hearing japa. Our mind should be immersed in hearing the japa. What is the use of any thoughts? They are all useless. Krishna is a reservoir of all thoughts. The shabda is before you. Just hear him. All realization, this shabda will speak all chit into your heart. You don't have to analyze at all. Like a dark room, light switch is put on, immediately light will come. In the same way, all knowledge will come into our heart. We should become attached to this Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. And if we are chanting on each bead as a relationship, I am the worshipper, the worshipped is the Nama Prabhu and the process of worship is chanting, hearing and tasking

**Key Quote:** "The real form of yajna for Kali Yuga is chanting and hearing Harinama."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights that chanting and hearing Harinama is the real form of yajna for Kali Yuga, bringing auspiciousness and emphasizing the Lord's role as the best friend and protector, contrasting the Lord's personal care for devotees with the neutral kala shakti that governs those who deny Him.

And in this way, this not only helps us, this nama japa yajna brings all auspiciousness to the temple. It brings all auspiciousness to the whole Bangalore city. See from the eyes of the shastra, that this is not an ordinary yajna. The real form of yajna for Kali Yuga is chanting and hearing Harinama. And that we are doing here. So take this very seriously, each bead has a relationship, God Himself. Who is the most intimate person to us? That we have forgotten. With every living entity, the most, the best friend of everybody is the Lord. He is a protector, He is a maintainer. Of course, those living entities who are not interested in Him, who are interested, not interested in Him, but they are interested in earning themselves, everything. It's called karma. The Lord allows them. And Lord has His neutral form called kala, kala shakti. No feelings. If you want feeling, then Krishna is personally there, in your heart. For those who do ye etamam prapadyante tam sute bhajam yaham Those who are denying God are also surrendering to God. When you deny God, you have to accept kala shakti. Kala shakti will rule them. Kala shakti will maintain them. Kala shakti will protect them according to their karma.

**Key Quote:** "So, we are worshipping Krishna himself directly. Therefore, it is important that we do not mindlessly chant and hear."
**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of avoiding mindless chanting, as it is an offense to Krishna, and highlights the Leelas of Nama Avatara in making spiritual advancement accessible.

Nama is inseparable from Krishna. Eternally they are unlimited. Krishna has a one supreme personality of the Godhead. So, we are worshipping Krishna himself directly. Therefore, it is important that we do not mindlessly chant and hear. Mindless chanting and hearing means our mind is somewhere else. While your tongue has been trained to chant, automatically chanting goes on, but the mind is on something else. Mind is thinking of some problem solving, mind is thinking of some philosophy, mind is thinking of some emotional problems, mind is thinking of some creative things and meanwhile your tongue is going on chanting. So that chanting, mindless chanting, only tongue is involved, mindless chanting. So mindless chanting is an offence. Naturally if God comes before you, if you don't give your mind to Him, is it not an offence? It is an offence. So, at all costs, we first have to come out of mindless chanting. Mindless chanting is mechanical, our consciousness is somewhere else, mechanically finishing the rounds, with no remembrance that this is Krishna before me. Because if that remembrance is there, it is Krishna before me, this Nama is Krishna Himself. Then naturally there is no question of mindlessness, your mind is on Krishna. So, we are developing this quality of worship of the sound incarnation of the Lord. Today Krishna is on this earth, doing His Leela in His sound incarnation. Because He is doing this Leela as a sound incarnation, that is how millions of people are making advancement in spiritual life, becoming devotees of Krishna and getting attached to the holy name of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Mindful chanting means we have to give our attention to hear what we are chanting."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes mindful chanting, touching the holy name with the heart, and the concept of the Nama Shabdha as 'electrified' with Satchidananda.

All these things are the Leelas of Nama Avatara and His pure devotee, Srila Prabhupada. We are all recipient of the mercy of Srila Prabhupada. We are the recipient of the mercy of this Nama Prabhu. As long as we think this is an ordinary sound, we will do mindless chanting. Mindful chanting means we have to give our attention to hear what we are chanting. And you cannot hear unless your mind is on the sound. Mindful chanting is very powerful. When you give attention, that is when the holy name you are touching with your heart. First you touch the holy name with your material tongue, the Shakti Avesha Nama Avatara. And then that sound, when it enters our heart, when we hear with devotion, then we touch Nama Prabhu. Because we are not the body, we are seated in this heart, the soul, the consciousness, the awareness. So by hearing, we touch the holy name of the Lord, Nama Prabhu. And Nama Prabhu, being Krishna Himself, and as we said this, repeatedly, Nam Nam Kari Baudha Ninja Sarva Shakti, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has declared that in that name that you chant with your tongue, all His unlimited powers are invested in it. So this sound is not ordinary sound. Just like an ordinary wire and electrified wire, both look same. But in one wire there is electricity, in another wire there is no electricity. So this Nama Shabdha's Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare is electrified sound. Electrified means not our normal electricity, Satchidananda electricity. The Satchidananda iced sound. When you touch electrical wire, which is live, you will get electrical shock. Similarly, when our heart touches the Satchidananda iced sound, we will get Satchidananda iced. Sat Chitta Ananda. Sat means spiritual power you will get. Chitta means pure knowledge. You will be able to experience Ananda, pure bliss, pure happiness.

Spiritful chanting is middle school. And soulful chanting level one is high school. Soulful chanting, soulful Japa, level two is graduation, soulful Japa, level three is post graduation and any number of levels of soulful Japa.

When you touch the Lord and when there is remembrance of the Lord, that Lord himself has come before me, for me, you become joyful. So, first mindful chanting may be little tapasya, where you have to control your mind to hear every word. That also has got four, five stages, how from mindless, slowly you can come to full mindful. So Japa card 1.1 to 1.6, 2.1 to 2.6 Shraddha, 3.1 to 3.6 Vinamrta. These three cards are put together easily like primary school of soulful Japa. Then that will lead to Spiritful Japa.

Enthusiastically you will do Japa. Not like a burden. Oh, I have to do 16 rounds. No. Happily you will do. Joyfully you will do. Enthusiastically you will do. That is Spiritful Japa. We have to train our mind towards this, from Mindful to Spiritful. From Spiritful, later on, it becomes Soul… it starts as Soulful Japa level one. Soulful Japa, where every bead of Japa is a relationship with the Nama who is before you. Relationship of surrender, relationship of worshipper, worshipped and worshipped. And relationship of begging for mercy from the Lord. Relationship of accepting with gratitude that Krishna alone is protecting me, Krishna alone is maintaining me. Relationship of begging forgiveness for offences. Relationship of expressing gratitude to Nama Prabhu. The relationship of Seva Apeksha, begging Krishna to give you more and more Seva. The privilege of doing more and more Seva. Just like we began this Yajna by Seva Apeksha, begging Nama Prabhu, please give me the privilege today to do the Seva of 108 Malas.

**Key Quote:** "Mindless Japa is like standing near the fire."
**Summary:** This segment describes the goal of life as moving from mindless to soulful japa, comparing Nama Avatara to the sun and using the analogy of iron and fire to illustrate the difference between mindless and mindful japa.

So our goal of life should be to move from Mindless Japa, is like kindergarten, Mindless Japa. Some effect is there, even though it's of some effect is there, because Krishna has decided to come as the Avatara. Does not matter who chants. So some touch. So, Mindless Japa is like Krishna Nama, the Mahamantra, Nama Avatara, it's like the Surya of Satchidananda. So Sun, like fire of Sun, Sun is fire, Sun is light and heat. Huge source. Similarly, Krishna Nama, Hare Krishna Mahamantra is a personality who is unlimited source of Satchidananda. So that Satchidananda Nama has to be, when you start hearing, then it is Mindful Japa. Not hearing means Nama is before you, but there is a distance between your heart and the Nama. Just like if you hold a piece of iron outside the fire, near the fire, you will get some heat. If you put the iron in the fire, you will become red hot. So Mindless Japa is like standing near the fire. There is no comparison. Standing outside the fire and inside the fire, big difference. Similarly, thousand rounds of hundred or thousand rounds of Mindless Japa is equal to one round of Mindful Japa. Because if you keep outside, you may little more than room temperature, the iron piece will get heated. Inside it goes, it becomes red hot. Difference is not little between Mindless and Mindful Japa.

Or, He will give you His remembrance, and you will be able to feel His presence, and you will be able to feel His presence, and you will be able to feel His remembrance, that I am before you.

**Key Quote:** "Just like if you memorize your Sloka, only one time you have to memorize. It's always, anytime you want, it will come out."
**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of memorizing slokas to explain how to internalize the content of the Japa cards, emphasizing that Harinama Prabhu is complete Satchidananda Krishna and introducing the concept of Shuddhanama Shabda.

You practice that. Once you practice that, you don't have... Once it goes into your mind, then you don't have to... Again and again, you don't have to... One time only, it has to go into your mind. Just like if you memorize your Sloka, only one time you have to memorize. It's always, anytime you want, it will come out. You don't have to go on, the rest of your life, memorize. So, in the same way, these cards, I am not saying memorize it, but intellectually memorize it, emotionally memorize it, what is there in it. See 1.1. These are, these cards, the content of these cards, you have to apply your intelligence, oh yes, I understand. So, intellectually, and some of them involve devotion, emotion. So, that also, you have to contemplate by repetition. What is the method? Just like you read, you read this card with understanding, every day for one month. About 10 times. It will take you about 10 minutes. Then slowly, this understanding will go into your consciousness. For instance, you should always bring, start japa, by knowing that Harinama Prabhu is complete, Satchidananda Krishna Himself, who manifests His sound form as Shuddhanama Shabda in the spiritual world. Krishna's Rupa is there in the spiritual world, Krishna's Nama is there also in the spiritual world, Satchidananda Rupa, Satchidananda Nama, and that Nama is called Shuddhanama Shabda in the spiritual world. This Shuddhanama of the spiritual world, enters the sound that you and me chant. And that is, that Shabda becomes the Nama Avatara. So, Shuddhanama enters the sound you chant and becomes the Nama Avatara, Krishna Himself. And that Nama contains all the Shaktis of Krishna. So, who kindly descends into this material world, in the chants that I utter, as the Shakti Avesha Nama Shabda, which is Shuddhanama's Mantra Murti.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly, this Mantra Murti, is the, it is the, this Shakti Avesha Nama, is the Mantra Murti of the Shuddhanama."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of Archa Vigraha to explain Shakti Avesha Nama Shabda, describes the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra as the crown jewel of Veda Shabdas, and encourages begging for mercy and association from Srila Prabhupada, Nithyananda Prabhu, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

Just like Archa Vigraha, that you see with your eyes, is the Archa Murti of Krishna's Satchidananda Rupa. Similarly, this Mantra Murti, is the, it is the, this Shakti Avesha Nama, is the Mantra Murti of the Shuddhanama. Because we cannot chant and hear Shuddhanama, with our material tongue and material ears, therefore the Lord appears in the Mantra Murti. Because we cannot see the Lord, with our material eyes, therefore the Lord comes as Archa Murti. So, Shabda Mantra Murti, is more accessible to us than Archa Murti. So, the very merciful incarnation. Now, this Nama Shabda, Shuddhanama Shabdas, the Shakti Avesha Nama Shabda, the Nama Avatara, is the crown jewel of all Veda Shabdas, whose toes are worshipped by the brilliant, spiritual, radiant, gem-like verses of Upanishads. The Upanishad Shabda, they all worship this, Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, as the supreme, because, the purpose of all the Upanishads, is to show us God. And here He is, Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, who has most kindly descended, through the Parampara, into the sounds that utter. We are chanting, the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, of our Parampara, which has come through, from Krishna, through the Parampara, through Prabhupada, we have got this Nama. So, therefore, I beg, Srila Prabhupada, Nithyananda Prabhu, always start your Japa, by begging to Srila Prabhupada, and Nithyananda Prabhu, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, please, make my, Japa, successful, today. Please give me your, association, give me the ability to hear you, I will try my best, not to, to avoid all offences, and begging, please grant me this rare, privilege, attraction, and attachment. It's a real privilege, to chant, these, holy names, which you have got, due to mercy of Prabhupada, and Nithyananda Prabhu. The rare privilege, why it's privilege, we already described, what is this Shabda, the crown jewel, of all the Veda Shabdas. Please grant me, the rare privilege. Please grant me, attraction, and attachment.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is, infinitely, VVVVVVVVIP, and He is coming before you."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes serving Harinama Prabhu with care and respect, describing Krishna as the infinitely most important person and highlighting His capacity to incarnate in the sound of His name.

So, let me, carefully, and respectfully, serve, Harinama Prabhu, and Harinama Prabhu, the most, infinitely, most important person, just like, we have VIPs, VVIPs, you say, there are important persons, in this material world. Krishna is, infinitely, VVVVVVVIP, and He is coming before you. It is His avatara. So, instead of VIP, we can call Him as, infinitely, most important person. So, during Japa, what are you doing? The most important person, infinitely, most important person, in existence, because, He is the supreme, personality of Godhead. We are all tiny, tiny, tiny persons. Among tiny, tiny persons, there will be some, VVIPs, VVIPs, etcetera, tiny VVIPs. But, we are worshipping, we are serving, we are receiving the Kripa, we are getting the association, before us, of, the infinitely, most important person. I am, IP. I am, infinitely, most, important, person. It is not a joke, that, I am, IP, the infinitely, most important person, has got that capacity, before each one of us, on each our, japa, on each, on this, in the sound of, each of our, shabda. That is, Krishna's capacity. Any number of, avatara, sharira, He can take. When, His name is, when you are uttering, His name, then, that sound is, one avatara sharira. When I am uttering, on my tongue, again, He incarnates as, another avatara sharira. So, this is unlimited, omnipotent sound, is what is, before us. So, like this, by reading this, all this, whatever I spoke, you have to, speak to yourself. Say, for thirty days, you do this,

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of bringing someone to a lecture without context to illustrate the importance of understanding the situation and context of Japa.

one card. Ten, ten minutes, you spend. After thirty days, I will give you the mic, and you will speak, what I spoke. That should be goal. So, this is one point one. One point two, when you do japa, you should know, what is the situation. If I bring somebody, from the street, make him sit here, in the lecture, he doesn't know, what is this class, who is the speaker, what is this lecture, he will just sit like that. Mechanically, he will sit. Correct? Why? Because he doesn't know, the context. Before you bring him, you have to tell, that see, there is a japa, you will know about japa, japa is important, this thing, that thing, who is the speaker, what is his qualification, what do you benefit, out of it, what actually, is going to go happen. Context has to be there, then only, you will get into the, then only, you can benefit, from the japa. So, the second, most important thing, after expressing gratitude, to Prabhupada, Nithyananda Prabhu, begging their mercy, and after understanding, that this is a rarest, of the rarest, of the opportunity, this, the, this shabda, is a rarest of the sounds, after understanding that, one should, immediately, get into the mood of, what is the situation, what is, what is happening during japa, there is a sevak, you are the sevak, there is a saviour, one who is receiving, there is a person, who is receiving your service, and there is a service, particular service, chanting, hearing, tasking, that serving is there. So, what is japa, you should know, that means, my mind enters, the content of, what, who, how, why, of japa yajna.

**Summary:** This segment explains the context of Japa Yajna, focusing on the roles of Sevak (servant), Saviour (Krishna), and Seva (service), and how the mind enters this context from the subconscious.

So, you get into the context. First time, when I, organized japa yajna, I have to tell you, what is this yajna, all these things. Afterwards, second time, third time, once you announce japa yajna, I don't have to tell about all that, you know, it is japa yajna, it is this. Similarly, this goes into our mind, as soon as you chant, you take your mala, immediately, in your consciousness, in the background, I am the sevak, sevak, saviour is going to come before me, I am going to offer seva, he is going to receive my seva. So, saviour is a receiver of, now, you see how the, you read this card, then, my mind enters the context, of what, etc., of japa yajna, from my subconscious mind, consisting of, who is saviour, who is sevak, and what is seva. Saviour, is a receiver of worship, he is nama prabhu, in the form of mantra murti, the necklace of sounds, of Hare Krishna and Rama. Who is sevak? He is a spirit person, with body person, desiring to please Krishna. I am a spirit person, but now, I am covered with the body person. And who is a sevak? He is a spirit person, along, his body person, in, the seva. And what is a seva? Seva is a yajna. Yajna, automatically means, activity for pleasing Vishnu. Seva is a yajna, of three doings, and one knowing chesta. Three doings. We do, and we know. This is our faculty. So, three doings. What are the three doings? First doing, chant the sound, capsule, while recalling, the nama prabhu, and then, chant the sound, capsule, while recalling, the nama prabhu, and then, recalling, the nama prabhu, is before me.

**Key Quote:** "Seva is a yajna, of three doings, and one knowing chesta."
**Summary:** The speaker details the three doings of Seva: chanting, hearing, and tasking (repetition), and emphasizes the importance of approaching Japa with servant egoism.

Second doing is, move the hearing. Your hearing should move. That is also doing. Second doing is, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Ram Ram, Hare Hare. As soon as you say, Hare, you have to hear, Hare Krishna, next, Krishna, Krishna, Hare Hare, you have to track, that is doing, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Ram Ram, Hare Hare. Word after word, nama after nama, should go inside. That is, unless you are doing that, you will not hear. So, second doing is, moving the hearing. Third doing is, tasking repetition. You repeat chanting and hearing, without any other thinking in between. Continuous, chanting, hearing, hearing. Unless you are tasking that, your mind will, after one, some air, it will go away. So, you have to task, continuously, okay, now I am starting my mala. I will not stop, till hundred and eight is finished. Then you want, you take little rest for your mind. But otherwise, only a sound, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Ram Ram, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Ram Ram, Hare Hare, hundred and eight times. So, that is called tasking. So, hearing, tasking, this is, this is, this is, Japa Yajna. What is, so, now, in your mind, you, you know, what is sevak, what exactly is sevak, what I should do during sevak. And, sevak, who is the sevak? That is the, spirit person. By offering on each bead in the mood of eternal servant egoism, egotism, not, but not, but now fallen. What mood should be the sevak? Sevak should be in the mood of servant egoism. There is a lording ego, boss egoism, and servant egoism. Humble servant egoism. You should, you stand before God, not as a proud man. You stand before the God, as God has come before you, your consciousness should be, humble servant egoism. So chant, the mood, so that is the sevak. You are the sevak, and you should have the right mood, of doing japa.

**Summary:** This segment explains how to offer Seva to the Lord with the right mood and provides guidance on understanding and recalling the information on the Japa cards using big letters and the white box summary.

And, then, in that mood, you offer the sevak, to the Lord. And, saviour, the Lord, will receive it, and he will be pleased, with each of your bead of your japa. So, 1.2. Like this, you read the cards, and understand what it means. You should read, see, in this, there is big letter, and small letter in red. When you first understand, you should under, you should read, all together, because then the sentence is complete. Once you know about it, know what it is, afterwards, you just see the big letters, you know what it is. Haan, sevak. Because that's, eternal servant egoism, is in the red line. Once you, see the big line, you understand, ok, servant egoism. Seva is the ajna of doings. So, that is why, I have written. And then, after you understand all these, in one line, essence is here, in the white box. See the white box, in that, 1.2. So, what is, the summary of it, is right there. I remind myself of, japa context of, seva, sevya, sevak. Seva, is the offering, simultaneous, triple doings, on each bead. Once you understand, these things, the essence of it, is there. This is how, we train our mind. First, you recall, what is, on the card, by, by reading, all together. Then, after few days, you recall, by reading, only the, big letters. Then, after the end of it, you recall, by, just one line, in the white, that will, automatically, come out, in the white box. So, that will, automatically, make you recall, the essence of, the rest of it. So, third card, these are all, very fundamental. That means, without knowing, the context of, japa, there is no meaning. You should know, meaning of, what you are doing. That is, a card number two, meaning. Then, purposeful, japa, ichcha, poroka, japa. Next,

To please, Nama Prabhu, and eternally, self-sounding, Hare Krishna, sound string. This sound is, this sound, is eternally sounding, in the spiritual world. You want to please, the Shuddha Nama, who has come down, into this material world, on the sound, into the sound, that I utter. What is the intention, of the act, chanting, hearing, remembering? What is the intention, of activity? Because, any activity, unless you have a purpose, you have a goal, you have an intention, your attention, your attention will not, lock. These three things, if you have, your attention will lock, on the sound. Because you know, why you are chanting. What is the purpose, you know? Purpose is association, and to please. So if you don't hear, where is the question, of association? So that, you have to think about, that card. Fourth card, is the golden direction, of the Brahmapada. Chant here, chant in here, by running the attention, to know each, Hare Krishna and Rama, as they are chanted, to form the full, mantra murti.

**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of a train running to illustrate how to chant and hear by running the attention to each name, forming the full mantra murti.

Just like, if I give you a task, there is a train running, you are standing, on the railway station. A train is, moving fast. There are, the bogies are of, three colors, red, green, and yellow. I'll give you a notebook, and a pen. I'll tell you, as a train is passing by, each Dabbai, has one number, bogie number. As it passes, you should, write down the bogie number. Bogie number is not, in our example, bogie number will be, either one, one to sixteen. That's all. So it is, it is running fast. Your attention has to be there. Yes. Notebook, one, two, ah, three is this. You have to, you have to note down, the bogie number. The same way, Hare Krishna is like, a train running. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, gone. Hare has come, he's gone. Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. So your mind should run, with, the Hare. Now it's Hare, now it is Krishna, now it's again Hare, now it's again Krishna, again Krishna, Krishna, then Hare, Hare. Now, coming to Rama string. Oh, first is always, Hare Krishna string. Then Hare Rama string comes. Hare, Rama, Hare, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama. Did you see the difference now? So, smart mind will repetitively learn, how to catch each nama, we don't practice, that is one of the problem. So, you, if you practice, then you will hear each nama. Okay. So, that is chant and hear, by running my attention to know. You have to run. Your attention is in your control. Your attention should run, with the train. Your attention should run, should go behind the chanting you're hearing chant and behind hearing should go immediately hurry hurry so that's mind tongue is chanting hurry your mind is going after the hurry tongue is chanting Krishna your mind is after Krishna so your tongue is engaged your mind is engaged so anyway now I will not I will I will not take more time because we have the at not to do basically I'm creating a course japa training course in that I will start with this mindful japa all that classes one by one classes we'll take at that time you can systematically I will tell just like the students have to be told what when homework you should do, what you should do, what you should not do, on their own it's difficult.

Japa Seva means it's our meeting with Krishna to give him Seva in this world. 24 hours we are continuously encountering, continuously interacting with different people, different situations, different things. These different people, different things, different situations, they are all characterized by one common character, one common quality: that they are all limited. In other words, day and night we are interacting with the limited. Let's say I talk to you, I am limited, you are limited, we are in a limited situation, we deal with limited things, limited people.

Now get a feel of this. Japa is a meeting of the limited person, we, with the unlimited person. It is a completely different kind of interaction. We deal with any avatara, we are meeting the unlimited person, the infinite. Infinitesimal we are, and infinite is the Supreme Lord. As a person is infinite, we are finite with finite qualities. Krishna is an infinite person with infinite qualities, yet he can be finite. The finite is included in the infinite, the infinite is not included in the finite, and infinite is not there. So, this we should always remember that when we are starting doing japa, you are relating

This is from the Upanishads. So all the shastras reveal that in Kali Yuga, Krishna, the limitless, the unlimited, the infinite—infinite person with infinite energies, infinite love, infinite compassion, infinite attraction, infinite kindness, infinite power—that Supreme Lord is the ultimate. He is skilful. He is complete. Dhammakara isthem cursivata yagai deshasa. Liberated Rabbata side shantipata. He is the infinite. 혹ala yagai deshasa. Contactless. He suo Voyages. Vedic кадh.

The scripture has revealed that I am under the nuestra. You are God. So this is called Shraddha. If you don't have Shraddha when you are chanting, then it becomes mechanical. You are thinking that you are chanting some sound, sound you are producing. No, the Lord enters, Lord's sound has entered that sound. That sound is infusing all Shaktis into this Avatara Shraddha. Avatari and Avatara, Avatari is a Shuddha Nama of the Lord, which is eternally vibrating in the spiritual world, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, eternally vibrating in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "The biggest secret is to always remember Krishna, Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto."
**Summary:** Because our spiritual senses are dormant, Krishna appears in the sound of the mantra, allowing us to serve Him with our senses and consciousness, fulfilling the essence of 'Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto'.

He cannot be captured by our material senses. But because now our spiritual senses are all sleeping, our original consciousness is also sleeping. Therefore, even though he is there within this sound, it is only by faith that we have to feel his presence. We cannot feel the presence of Shuddha Nama with our tongue, with our ears now. Krishna is so kind, knowing our limitation to touch him transcendentally, he takes Avatara in the sound that we chant, which is full of all the Shaktis of the Lord, the Chittananda Shakti. And through this Shakti Avesha Nama, the Shuddha Nama, Krishna receives our service of engaging our sense tongue, engaging our mind, engaging our ears to serve him with our consciousness. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto, Madhyaji Maam Namaskaru, Mame Vishnu Satyam Dev, Pratijnani Piyo Simhi. The biggest secret is to always remember Krishna, Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto. Keep Krishna always in one's mind, in one's Chittam, consciousness as the greatest truth. And that truth we can easily practice by always keeping Krishna on our tongue, ears and mind. That is the biggest secret. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu taught us how to practice Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto.

**Key Quote:** "Wherever my mind goes I go, so if my mind goes on Hare Krishna... I am also taken there."
**Summary:** Hearing the mantra is crucial because the mind tends to wander; by focusing the mind on the sound of Krishna's name, one is transported to Krishna.

He is by Kirtaniya Sadahari. So the most important thing during Japa, you have to understand because Krishna has come down as Sound. Sound can end your mind through the ears. That means hearing is very important. Now we are conditioned by our mind. We live where the mind goes. My mind goes there, I also go there. Your mind is here, then my mind, I also go there. I am riding on the vehicle of the mind, just like you sit in a car, wherever the car goes, you also go. In the same way, wherever my mind goes, I go. So if my mind goes on Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, I am also taken there, I also go there. Rather, we should utilize our mind to always go towards Krishna by chanting Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. So when you start japa, keep this in mind. This is a different relationship and a different activity than any other activity, which is all my interaction with limited things. Limited one, limited person is dealing with limited things and limited persons.

**Key Quote:** "There is no difference between Krishna and Krishnanama."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the limited results of karma with the unlimited potential of japa, emphasizing that Krishna's name possesses all of Krishna's qualities and is non-different from Him.

And the output also will be limited. That is the world of karma. But the moment you start japa, you know that no, I am now next two hours I am going to interact with the all loving, limitless, supreme personality of Godhead Krishna. Our mind has to understand that. The sound is unlimited, form is unlimited, his activities are unlimited, his shaktis are unlimited. And that is what now I am touching, that is what I am connecting myself to. Unlimited intelligence, unlimited beauty, unlimited power. Whatever, there is no difference between Krishna and Krishnanama. All Krishna's wonderful qualities are also qualities of Krishnanama. In fact, Krishna himself tells Arjuna the glories of his holy name. When he comes as holy name, he is more merciful, more compassionate. Just simply by hearing, you are able to touch him. There is no difference between Krishna's sound body or physical body. He can take unlimited forms. So Shabdakrishna is Purna Krishna. Like Rupa Krishna, naturally we easily accept it is Purna Krishna. Here is Krishna. But because of our conditioning, when it comes to sound, we don't feel that, Oh, here Krishna is before me.

Because Krishna and Krishna's name are non-different. So just like Krishna becameनं्ठित अपने कुषंड , Krishna only becomes His name, and His name is Shuddha Nama . Just like Krishna is all effulgent, sat- Chidanananda effulgence, similarly Krishna खुण्वजति नामाँ संत्रस्थारुह् नामाँ सच्छित्� bloomless child , Similarly, Krishna's namah, Shuddhanama, is also Surya, Son of sat-Chidanananda effulgence, Chittananda effulgence.

**Summary:** Chanting and hearing attentively transforms our consciousness by infusing it with Satchitananda energy, similar to how iron becomes hot by contact with fire.

Just like Prabhupada gives the example of how when an iron piece is put in the fire, the iron by association of the fire, the fire's energy heat is passed on to the iron piece and the iron gradually becomes warmer and warmer and warmer and finally it becomes red hot fire-like by transfer of energy. Similarly, by chanting and hearing, attentively, the Shakti Avesha Rama, our consciousness also gets Satchitanandaized by flow of Sat energy, Chit energy and Ananda energy. And the covering of this present soul, our present condition, the covering is Asat, Achit and Nirananda. So the Sat, Chit and Ananda energy that is coming from the Shakti Avesha Rama, the fire of Satchitananda Rama, Shakti Avesha

Because of these three coverings, we have forgotten who we are, what is our relationship with Krishna, we have forgotten what is real Ananda because of this covering. And the Lord is so kind and merciful that He comes down to give us His Satchitananda association. Just like Sun is surrounded by the Sun, the Sun is surrounded by the Sun. Just like Sun is surrounded by the Sun, the Sun is surrounded by the Sun. Just like Sun is surrounded by light and heat, so much of effulgence. Similarly, Krishna is Satchitananda Vigraha. His name is Satchitananda Vigraha and they are like the Sun from whom unlimited Satchitananda effulgence is emanating. So associating with Nama means associating with the Sat, Chit and Ananda energy, pure energies.

Krishna Chaitanya Rasa Vigraha. This sound is a vigraha of all rasas. Krishna Chaitanya Rasa Vigraha. This sound is an invalid. This is just oozing. That means all pleasure, all kinds of relationship with Krishna is a reservoir. Rasa Vigraha, poornashuddha nithyamukta poornashuddha means completely pure. That means there is no Asatha Chitnirananda. Purnashuddha nithyamukta. Life is finite to all forms that matter. That is why Raara is must. Ananda Incorporated with Nama.

**Key Quote:** "In the same way, there is a flow of Satchitananda provided we hear what we chant."
**Summary:** The Lord gives us association through the Nama Avatara, purifying our mind through attentive hearing.

There is no difference between the nama and the one whose name it is. So the Lord through the nama avatara gives us association. And what does association mean? Association means just like iron put in the fire, there is a flow of fire from the fire to the iron, flow of heat. In the same way, there is a flow of Satchitananda provided we hear what we chant. By hearing, by hearing we need to give the mind. Only when you hear, the mind becomes pure. Mind means chittam. Mind means manas, buddhi, ahankara. Three layers. Ego, intelligence, mind. They all have to... Asat, achitta and nirananda are sitting in these three places. And when we attentively hear, this shakti avesha nama is touching all these three. When you hear, mind is required. When you chant, your ego is required. I am chanting. I am hearing. So in this way, attentive hearing, chanting and hearing attentively brings tremendous difference to this self.

**Summary:** The Lord descends in Kali Yuga through His Holy Names, offering a direct and personal relationship to each individual.

That we have to understand. Just like Prabhupada gives example, if you put hand in the fire, child or no, adult or anybody, it will burn. In the same way, very fortunate that the Lord has decided in Kali Yuga to descend in His holy names. So it is... That is called nama avatara. Should take advantage of this. Avatara means Lord has become accessible to us in the form of this secret we should understand. If you understand this secret, from this you can derive everything else. You will know why you have to be attentive. You know why you have to be respectful. You know why you have to be joyfully chant. Lord Himself is before me. If that fundamental shraddha is developed, for shraddha also, these are all the wonderful analogies that the acharyas have given in order to build our shraddha. That Lord is before me when I chant and He is before each one of us personally. It is not that the Lord does not care. Lord... The Supreme Lord cares for every amsa, every one of us. So you have to understand that the Lord is very personal when He comes on our tongue. But we are impersonal. So we should also be personal. The Lord has come for me. He comes for everybody. That's a different matter. But the fact remains that if He comes for everybody, He doesn't become diluted in His personal appearance for each one of us.

A big man comes or a father is having ten children. His attention is divided into ten children. Is it not? Even though, they are all my children, He says. But Krishna is not like that, the Supreme Father. Though everyone has a direct relationship with Him, in a general sense, oh, they are all my... mamaya vamsa jiva loke jiva bhuta sanatana all are your amsas, my amsas. He doesn't leave it at that. He has a direct relationship with every living entity. So we have... That is the reason why He has come on our tongue. No doubt, some people get benefit of this avatara. Some people don't get the benefit of this avatara. That is due to the causeless mercy of the spiritual masters, Srila Prabhupada, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's causeless mercy that some of us get this opportunity. Everybody can get, but some of us have already got this opportunity. Where we begin to serve the Holy Name, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna,

**Summary:** Repeatedly reflecting on the truth of the Holy Name is necessary to change our default perception and impress it upon our subconscious mind.

How does this understanding come? You have to repeatedly, you have to think about it. You have to do mananam. There has to be on these simple things, what few things that just now you heard. When you hear, everything feels good for you, yeah, I understood it. But it has to become part of your moment, you utter Hare Krishna. This perception has to come, that He is before me. So for that, why He is before me? All these things is what I explained. You should do mananam. Yeah, yeah, I can understand. I can believe. I don't qualify, but He is so all-merciful, He can come. And the shastra says He comes. So He comes, so He is there. I have shraddha, I have faith. That, many times you should think, because your conscious mind is fine, you understand that. But you have a subconscious mind, which has its own ignorance. This has to go inside there. Because normally when we hear any sound, it is ordinary sound. Now if our default perception has to change, that this is not ordinary sound, it is Krishna, you have to do mananam. Many times you have to tell your subconscious mind, again and again, this is the truth, this is the truth,

When you do dhyanam, it is emotional contemplation of the factual relationship between me and Nama Tattva, Nama Prabhu.

Relationship, nice, love, this, everything. Isn't it? Emotional contemplation. Or, you have got an appointment letter for a good job, very good job, big money, big salary. So, you are not enjoying the job, but you indulge in emotional contemplation. Oh, how nice it will be, my future, when I get this salary, when I get this, all these things. Emotional contemplation. Similarly, we should also have, for any relationship to become deepened, first is emotional contemplation. First is the truth about the relationship. That is rational reflection. That is coming from Shravanam. Shravanam, first you hear, and then, you, what you heard, you engrave in your subconscious, that is called Mananam. First you hear, Krishna has come down, Krishna is this, Krishna is that, no difference between His sound and Himself, all the Shaktis are entering, this is Shakti-Vajanama, the Lord is before me, but I cannot taste Him, I cannot experience Him, but I can experience His Shaktis, etc., etc., etc., all these things, you hear, what I said.

Shravanam. Now, if you don't do Mananam, it will just go away. Or a hundred times, you hear, different, different times, slowly, it deficits into your subconscious mind. So, you have to do Mananam. And then, Dhyanam. This is not during Japa. But, then there is one more step. Just like I gave example, then, when you actually get into the job, a good job you have got, then not all emotionally, emotional contemplation, with full belief and everything, you are now actually engaging with that experience. Earlier, you were contemplating that experience. Next, you are engaging with that experience. You started going for the job. You started getting the salary. You got, getting, everybody in the, you know, community is praising you. Oh, now you are this, you are that. That, that is called Anushilanam. Anushilanam means, practice.

**Key Quote:** "Your consciousness is grounded with Shravanam."
**Summary:** A rich background consciousness, grounded in Shravanam, is essential for developing a relationship ego as a servant of the Holy Name.

So, not that we keep our background consciousness empty. Of course, it will be empty, if you have not done Mananam, Dhyanam. Actually, if you go on repeatedly hearing automatically Mananam, Dhyanam will happen. Mananam is stage two of Shravanam. Dhyanam is stage one of them. Stage two is Dhyanam. And then you practice that stage three. So, everything comes from Shravanam. Your consciousness is grounded with Shravanam. And we hear from Guru, Sadhu and Shastra, all the narratives. The narratives from Guru, Sadhu and Shastra, is what creates our perceptions about the world, about the thing, about the people, about Nama, about Krishna, everything. So, somewhere we have to start. Then what happens? When you Anushilanam, when you practice it, then you develop a relationship ego. I am servant of a realistic relationship ego, that I am servant of Nama Prabhu. I am chanter, I am hearer, I am tasker, I am serving. So, once that relationship is there, that is what, as soon as you take your beat back, your relationship persona with the Holy Name, along with its, along with his Shraddha, Preeti, everything that you have developed, that will automatically come. So, then every beat will be a relationship with the Nama.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of marriage to illustrate the lack of personal relationship many devotees have with the Holy Name, despite spending time chanting.

Every beat. See, just like I asked in one seminar, Japa seminar, how many of you are married? Many of them raised their head. How many years? They said five years, six years, three years, twenty years, everything. Then I asked them, is there a difference in your relationship between both of you from the beginning of first day of your marriage to second year, third year, fourth year, fifth year, sixth year? Isn't it becoming deeper and deeper relationship? Everybody said, yes, definitely. I never knew her, he never knew, I never knew him. But, after few months, relationship, relationship, it is deepening. Then I asked, how many years you are chanting Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. They all said, two years, three years, five years, six years, seven years. Hare, with your wife, you are able to build relationship. But with Krishna himself, with everyday, two hours you are with.

**Key Quote:** "Now for you to chant with humility, you have to have done lot of Shravanam, Mananam and Dhyanam, what is humility."
**Summary:** Chanting with humility requires prior Shravanam, Mananam, and Dhyanam to understand and cultivate the feeling of humility.

This is Vinamrita Japa, chant with humility before Nama Prabhu. Now for you to chant with humility, you have to have done lot of Shravanam, Mananam and Dhyanam, what is humility. Otherwise it won't come out at that time. Humility is a feeling. A feeling if it has to generate, you have to have the thoughts, just like if you are angry with someone, there is a thought behind that anger. Similarly, if there is a feeling of humility, there has to be a thought behind it. And that thought behind it, philosophy behind it, you have to have hear how insignificant you are etc, etc, etc, all that thing, just see. You see the connection? So now whatever little you have got understanding of humility, you can chant today. But parallelly you can go on doing your Mananam. Shravanam, Dhyanam on all these things, your quality of humility will go on increasing.

**Key Quote:** "You have to give your soul."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Preeti Japa (chanting with love), Atma Jnana Japa (chanting with self-knowledge), contrasting it with Yantra Japa (mechanical chanting), emphasizing the need for transcendental knowledge and detachment.

But today you can chant and hear only with the extent of humility that you have developed by Shravanam, Mananam and Dhyanam. Preeti Japa, feelings of love and pleasure giving to Nama Prabhu. In one sentence it is simple. But why? Because you feel love. When you know that someone loves you only, your love comes. That means all this, your Shravanam, actually Krishna loves us all. When that becomes a realization, automatic. So when he says, I am chanting and hearing, he thinks his body is chanting and hearing. But gradually, by the touch of the holy name itself, real self-knowledge, liberation of body and the self, all these things also in the background, your quality of Japa changes. When you understand that you are different from this body and you are using this body and offering this Seva, you are the real chanter and hearer. The Yantra Japa, mechanical Japa is called Yantra Japa. You are not involved. You are involved somewhere else. And you are offering Yantra Japa. That's also so powerful, such a big Punya it is. So powerful. But you don't get Bhakti if you do Yantra Japa. You have to give your soul. Because soul is what, you know, wants relationship with Krishna, not your Yantra. So that is Atma Jnana Japa. So entire, see for Atma Jnana, background who you are, who God is, why are you here, all these Jnana, when you read Prabhupada's book Shravanam, they are all matter, matters a lot in creating the background. Devotional service has to be executed in the background of transcendental knowledge and detachment. Something is required in the background. Knowledge, transcendental knowledge and detachment from this illusion. And then execution of service.

Jubilantly here. No, utsa, enthusiastically repeat. To build up the mercy. Sambandha Japa. Every weed is a relationship with Nama Prabhu. Simple relationship. I am the worshipper.

So these are the sixteen Bhavanas, to be practiced. But, as I said, understand the whole process. First and foremost is, to touch the Holy Name. Shraddha, hearing and Shraddha, is fundamental. All others are, bonus. Comes later. But this you have to, somehow you have to struggle. That's why I said, about Nama Tattva. Simple things. What I told in ten minutes, that should be Mananam. You should, next one month, two months, think about it. How it is true. It becomes part of you. Shraddha, is very important. Shraddha is foundation. It is lack of Shraddha, that makes us, mechanical. If Shraddha is deep, it will not become mechanical. So, you tackle this first thing, of Shraddha. Develop that faith, in what, Guru Sadhu and Shastra, has said about, Nama, Nama Avatara, Shakti Avasya Nama, Shuddha Nama, etc, etc.
