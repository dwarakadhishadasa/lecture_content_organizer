**Key Quote:** "Their meeting is completely transcendental completely spiritual so these topics are also Krishna Katha."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with an introduction to the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on the questions asked by the sages of Naimisharanya about Parikshit Maharaj and Sukadeva Goswami and their connection to Krishna.

In this session we will be discussing from two verses, the first and second verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We are beginning a new chapter in this session. The 18th chapter is entitled Maharaj Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy. If you remember, this first canto began by the sage Naimisharanya asking six questions. To begin with, this was a print of this discussion from the Ugrashrava Suta, Suta Goswami, and Suta Goswami answered these questions and he saw the Sages are very eager to hear about Krishna. So when he saw the eagerness to hear about Krishna, then he said I am going to recite the Srimad Bhagavatam as I heard it from Sukadeva Goswami, when Sukadeva Goswami is speaking Bhagavatam seven days continuously to Parikshit Maharaj, when Parikshit Maharaj is about to quit his body, cursed by a brahmana body. So before Suta Goswami could begin reciting the Bhagavatam that he heard from Shukadeva Goswami, the sage Brahmishananya had so many more questions: please tell us before you begin reciting Bhagavatam, please tell us about Parikshit Maharaj, please tell us about Shukadeva Goswami, please tell us how did Parikshit Maharaj meet Shukadeva Goswami, how did they meet and we have heard that Parikshit Maharaj's birth activities and even his death is very very glorious, please describe in detail these topics which pertain to Krishna. Krishna means Krishna and his pure devotees. So since Shukadeva Goswami is a pure devotee of Krishna, Parikshit Maharaj is a pure devotee of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Parikshit protected his citizens against influence of Kali by taking proper steps so they were amazed what a great and wonderful personality is Parikshit Maharaj"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the first verse of the 18th chapter, highlighting Parikshit Maharaj's wonderful administration and his ability to protect his citizens from the influence of Kali, emphasizing his surrender to Krishna.

The first verse of the 18th chapter, Shukadeva Goswami said, "Due to the mercy of the personality of God, Shri Krishna, who acts wonderfully, Maharaj Parikshit, though struck by the weapon of the son of Drona in his mother's womb, could not be so." In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The sages of Naimisharanya became struck with wonder after hearing about the wonderful administration of Maharaj Parikshit, especially in reference to his punishing the personality of Kali and making him completely unable to do any harm within the kingdom." See, Parikshit Maharaj gave shelter to Kali, but who is Kali? He is the friend of irreligion, adharma bandhu. He's got nefarious purpose. So Parikshit Maharaj gave him shelter, at the same time he incapacitated Kali Purusha to do any harm within his kingdom. Parikshit protected his citizens against influence of Kali by taking proper steps. So they were amazed what a great and wonderful personality is Parikshit Maharaj. Suta Goswami is equally anxious to describe Maharaj Parikshit's wonderful birth and death and this verse is stated by Suta Goswami to increase the interest of the sage Naimisharanya that his birth was wonderful, now hear about his death, even that is very very

**Key Quote:** "Only a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord is fearless in this material existence."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the second verse, focusing on Parikshit Maharaj's fearlessness due to his surrender to Krishna, contrasting it with the miseries of material existence (birth, death, old age, and disease).

very wonderful. Second verse: brahma kopa utthitaad yastu, brahma kopa utthitaad yastu, brahma kopa utthitaad yastu takshakath phduina prihlavathu nasamuhamoha urubhayat bhagavati arpitashayaha. The meaning of the second verse: furthermore, Maharaj Parikshit was always consciously surrendered to the personality of Godhead and therefore he was neither afraid nor overwhelmed by fear due to a snake bird which was to bite him because he was afraid of him and of the fury of a brahmana boy. Before describing the details of Pariksit being cursed by a brahmana boy for an untimely death due to the curse being bitten by a snake bird, Suta Goswami is telling the sage Nami Sharanya that Pariksit Maharaj was not afraid of death itself, what to speak of fear of death due to a curse being bitten by a snake bird, he had no fear at all. Why? Because he is always surrendered to the personality of Godhead Krishna. So in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains this point. A self-surrendered devotee of the Lord is called Narayana, Narayana, Parayana. One is completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord Narayana and is very much attached to the Lord. Such a person is never afraid of any place or person, not even of death. Only a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord is fearless in this material existence. Otherwise in the material existence there are always these four right components, one is a pure devotee of the Lord and one is a pure devotee of the Lord. So Nami Sharanya is telling us that the pure devotee of the Lord is fearlessness in this material existence. Otherwise in the material existence there are always these four fundamental problems which simply are giving so much of miseries to the living

**Key Quote:** "Material existence means these four fundamental Dukha, Dosha. Dukha means misery and Dosha means defect."
**Summary:** The lecture elaborates on the miseries of material existence and how a surrendered devotee views heaven and hell equally, understanding them as creations of the Lord.

entities. Janma, Mrtyu, Jara, Vyadi, Dukha, Dosha, Anudarshanam, Krishna warns about this in the 13th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Material existence means these four fundamental Dukha, Dosha. Dukha means misery and Dosha means defect. So, nobody can avoid these four things. Once they take birth in this material world, they have to face death at a later time. And in between birth and death, there are the miseries of disease and old age. But a person who is completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord, like Maharaj Pariksit, is never afraid of any misery or any person or any situation, not at all. He is fearless. For him, that means for such a surrendered soul, nothing is as important as the Supreme Lord. Thus, he gives equal importance to heaven and hell. Why? How is it possible? That a surrendered devotee of the Supreme Lord, how does he give equal importance to heaven and hell? There is so much difference in the conditions of living in heaven and hell. The reason is, he knows well that both heaven and hell are creations of the Lord. Who is the creator of this material existence? The different planetary systems, the different arrangements, the different facilities. It is Supreme Lord himself. He is the original creator. There are secondary creators, but the original creator is the Supreme Lord. And similarly, life and death are different conditions of existence created by the Lord in this material world.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But in all conditions and in all circumstances in this material world, remembrance of Narayana is essential if at all somebody wants to be fearless."
**Summary:** The importance of remembering Narayana in all circumstances is emphasized, along with the explanation of how Parikshit Maharaj, as a pure devotee, was not afraid of death or the curse because he considered it sent by Narayana.

It is an arrangement of the Supreme Lord that those living entities who are rebellious to devotional service, who are rebellious and who don't want to live with the Supreme Lord in the spiritual kingdom of God, they are placed in material existence and they are placed in situation of life and death, heaven and hell, etc. But in all conditions and in all circumstances in this material world, remembrance of Narayana is essential if at all somebody wants to be fearless, somebody wants protection, somebody wants to avoid suffering from these conditions. What is most essential and what works really ultimately is the remembrance of Narayana. Constant remembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. The Narayana Parayana practices this constantly. A pure devotee like Maharaj Pariksit, he practices remembering Narayana constantly. Maharaj Pariksit was such a pure devotee. He was wrongfully cursed by an inexperienced son of a brahmana. He was wrongfully cursed by an inexperienced son of a brahmana. This son of the brahmana was under the influence of Kali. Therefore, he wrongly cursed Parikshit Maharaj. And details will be described in the later part of this chapter by Suta Goswami. But here Prabhupada is just explaining how Parikshit was not afraid of death or the curse or the bite of this snake bird by which he was supposed to die. He was not afraid of that.

### Parikshit Maharaj, Krishna's Protection, Brahmastra, Surrender

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Anything sent by God is a blessing for the devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of how Krishna saved Parikshit Maharaj from the Brahmastra in his mother's womb, highlighting Parikshit's understanding that even his death by snake bite would be by the will of the Lord, and how a devotee sees everything as a blessing.

So, Maharaj Parikshit took this curse to be sent by Narayana. How is it possible for Parikshit to consider like this? He knew that Narayana, Lord Krishna had saved him when he was burned in the womb of his mother. How did Parikshit take birth? When he was in the womb of his mother. At the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, this Dronacharya's son Ashwatthama was fighting on the side of the Kauravas and the Kauravas had lost the battle. So, he wanted to somehow take revenge against the Kauravas losing the battle. So, he tried to kill them. He tried to kill the five Pandavas and by mistake he killed the five sons of the five Pandavas, Upapandavas and by beheading them when they were asleep, fast asleep. And this was not at all appreciated by Duryodhana, his master. Duryodhana condemned this heinous act by Ashwatthama. And then Ashwatthama was actually punished by Arjuna, though his life was spared. And then he still was not, was not still giving up the opportunity to do some harm, some destruction for the Pandavas. So, what did he do? He used a Brahmastra to kill the only surviving descendant of the Pandavas who was Maharaj Parikshit, in the womb of his mother, the grandson of Arjuna, in the womb of his mother, Abhimanyu's wife, Arjuna's daughter-in-law. So, he tried to kill Parikshit in the womb of his mother. But Parikshit was saved by Krishna when this danger was there. So, Parikshit knew that he was saved by the Supreme Lord Narayana or Lord Krishna when he was in the womb of his mother. And similarly, if he were to be killed by a snake bite, it would also take place by the will of the Lord. So, the devotee never goes against the will of the Lord. Anything sent by God is a blessing for the devotee.

**Key Quote:** "That is the sign of a pure devotee of the Lord. A pure devotee is always fearless."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by summarizing the qualities of a pure devotee, emphasizing their fearlessness, protection under the Lord's shelter, and indifference to material situations due to their complete surrender.

So, devotee is completely surrendered to the Lord. His life is in the hands of the Lord. Nobody else can do anything without the Lord's sanction in the material world. Therefore, Maharaj Parikshit was neither afraid nor bewildered by such things as a curse or bite of a snake bird or death itself. That is the sign of a pure devotee of the Lord. A pure devotee is always fearless. He is always protected. He is always under the shelter of the Supreme Lord. And in this way, he is actually indifferent to all material situations and circumstances. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "This is just like nectar for mortal beings like us."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 11th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that hearing about Krishna's activities is like nectar for mortal beings, offering a path to immortality.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 11th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This chapter is entitled Maharaj Pariksit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy. In the beginning of this chapter, there are descriptions of events leading to that particular incident. The 11th verse is as follows: Suta Jeevasamah Saumya Shashwative NFiSth Travisa Vishedam Yashah Astvam Shamsasie Krishnasya Martheanam Amrutham He Nahab. Meaning of this verse: The good sages said, Oh, grave Suther has Swami, may you live many years and have eternal fame, for you are speaking very nicely about the activities of Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead. This is just like nectar for mortal beings like us. Martyanam Amrutam Hinaha.

**Key Quote:** "It will guarantee eternal life for whoever hears them."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the meaning of 'Martya' (place of death) and 'Amrutam' (nectar), emphasizing that hearing narrations about Krishna guarantees eternal life.

Everyone in this earth planet is called Martya. Martya means this place is a place of death. Mrutyu, from Mrutyu the word Martya comes. That does not mean that people living on other planets don't die. But here particularly, the death can be perceived or can be perceived as a place of death. It can be understood as one of the fundamental problems that plague our material existence. And for somebody who is certainly going to die, the nectar, Amrutam, Amrutam means just the opposite of death, that which helps one counteract death, that which gives eternal life, Amrutam. So, this narration about Krishna is just like Amrutam. It's like drinking nectar. It will guarantee eternal life for whoever hears them.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how the sages of Naimisharanya praised Suta Goswami for speaking about Krishna, enabling them to conquer death through hearing the nectarian narration.

So, therefore, the description here is given. The sages of Naimisharanya, who assembled for a long sacrifice, they are hearing Srimad Bhagavatam from Suta Goswami. So, Suta Goswami is speaking so nicely that they are perceiving this narration about Krishna as very, very pleasing to the ears. And it also guarantees eternal life. So, therefore, they are addressing Suta Goswami and telling, may you live many years and have eternal fame. Eternal fame because Suta Goswami's action, or Suta Goswami's act, is very, very glorious. Simply by speaking about Krishna, Suta Goswami is giving an opportunity for all those assembled sages to hear this nectarian narration and thereby conquer death, which is otherwise impossible. So, Aushriya Prabhupada explains in the purport.

### transcendental qualities, spiritual energy, material energy, bondage

**Verse References:** BG 4.9
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna has two kinds of energies that are working in this world, the material energy and the spiritual energy."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada and Bhagavad Gita, explaining the difference between Krishna's transcendental activities performed under spiritual energy and the conditioned souls' actions under material energy, which causes bondage.

Aushriya Prabhupada explains in the purport, Why do we hear about the transcendental qualities and activities of the personality of Godhead? We may always remember what has been spoken by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad Gita, Fourth Chapter, Ninth Verse of the Bhagavad Gita. What does the Lord say? His acts, even when He acts in human society, are all transcendental, for they are all accentuated by the spiritual energy of the Lord, which is distinguished from its material energy. Krishna has two kinds of energies that are working in this world, the material energy and the spiritual energy. So the spiritual energy is the energy by which Krishna and his pure devotees, they act under that spiritual energy. And we in the material world, the conditioned souls, we are acting under the material energy. Material energy is the cause of bondage. Contaminated by the three gunas, the three modes of material nature, whereas spiritual energy is pure, it is completely spiritual and it is free from any influence of the gunas.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's actions karma called as karma in this verse and janma Krishna's birth are completely transcendental this means that Krishna does not act or take his birth like an ordinary living being under the custody of material energy"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain that Krishna's birth and activities are transcendental, unlike ordinary beings who are under the control of material energy and possess changeable, material bodies.

So there is a very, very big difference between spiritual energy and material energy. Krishna's actions are always transcendental because they are always performed under the spiritual energy. So Srila Prabhupada further says, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita, such acts are called divyam. The verse is janma karma chame divyam, transcendent, all are transcendental. Krishna's actions, karma, called as karma in this verse, and janma, Krishna's birth, are completely transcendental. This means that Krishna does not act or take his birth like an ordinary living being under the custody of material energy. We all take birth under the material energy, so we get a material body, we have a material mind, we have material ego. All these are covering our real self, that is the spirit soul, and we are covered by these material coverings. When Krishna appears or Krishna takes birth in the material world, like he did five thousand years back, he does not take birth like an ordinary living being, nor is his body material or changeable like that of ordinary living beings. Our body is always material. When we take birth in this world, we take a material body, we accept the material body. Krishna's body is not material. Now, material body has got a characteristic that it is constantly changing. Body is changing from childhood to old age, and the body changes even at the time of death. So we are subject to this changeable body.

### Krishna's nature, liberation, spiritual realm, devotional service

**Verse References:** BG 4.9
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Such a person is not reborn after leaving the present material body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that understanding Krishna's transcendental nature leads to liberation from rebirth and admittance into the spiritual realm, where one can engage in loving devotional service.

Now, if somebody understands this fact that Krishna's body is completely transcendental and even Krishna's activities are completely spiritual, then such a person, when he understands this particular fact about Krishna either from the Lord or from authorized sources, directly one may hear from Krishna or one may hear from a representative of Krishna coming in parampara who is a pure devotee, then what happens? Such a person is not reborn after leaving the present material body. Punar janma naiti, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita. Such an enlightened soul is admitted into the spiritual realm of the Lord and engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So the destination after death is dependent on what kind of activities we perform while we are in this body in the present life. If we hear about Krishna and we become enlightened about his transcendental nature, then we are eligible to go to the personal abode of the supreme Lord after quitting this body at the time of death, and there we can engage in loving devotional service to Krishna. So that's the perfection of life, that is the highest perfection, and that is possible simply by hearing Krishna katha from the right source.

### Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, hearing, progress, back to Godhead

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply by dedicating oneself to hearing about Krishna from the proper from a true representative of Shukudev Goswami, or a true representative of Krishna himself, then we definitely make progress."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of hearing about Krishna from authentic scriptures like Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, and from true representatives, to make progress on the path back to Godhead.

So Srila Prabhupada says, therefore, the more we hear about the transcendental activities of the Lord as they are stated in the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam... See, where do you find such descriptions of the transcendental activities of the Lord? You can find it accurately described in the authentic original scriptures. So in the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, two most important scriptures, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches us there are so many varieties of Vedic literature, innumerable, but among all of them, two particular literatures are singled out by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He says, you just focus and concentrate and study or hear or discuss subject matter presented in two books: Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. So we should hear about the transcendental activities of Krishna from the Bhagavad Gita and from the Srimad Bhagavatam. What happens for somebody who hears that? The more we hear, the more we can know about his transcendental nature. To understand the transcendental nature of Krishna is a little difficult if we consider the fact that we are used to hearing about the material activities of people in this world, but to hear about Krishna, Krishna's transcendental activities, means we are making definite progress on the path back to Godhead. So this is a fact that simply by dedicating oneself to hearing about Krishna from the proper, from a true representative of Shukadev Goswami, or a true representative of Krishna himself, then we definitely make progress. And by making such progress, we actually go back to Godhead.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "You chant Hare Krishna, and you hear Bhagavatam every day."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by recommending chanting Hare Krishna and hearing Bhagavatam regularly, as suggested by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, to attain eternal life and reach Krishna's personal abode.

So, the recommendation by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is particularly available, that he says, you chant Hare Krishna, and you hear Bhagavatam every day. The Bhagavatam itself recommends, Nityam Bhagavata Sevaya, always render service to Bhagavatas, two kinds of Bhagavatas, the book Bhagavatam, and the devotee Bhagavatam, the pure devotees particularly. So, we should actually hear Bhagavatam regularly, or read Bhagavatam regularly, and that will guarantee us eternal life after quitting this body, because we simply become eligible to go to Krishna's personal abode if our consciousness is properly situated at the time of death, and such preparation of consciousness is possible by simply chanting Hare Krishna, hearing Bhagavatam daily, etc. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "You are distributing nectar of the lotus feet of Govinda, the Supreme Lord. And that is very pleasing to us."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.12, explaining that the sages of Naimisharanya are glorifying Suta Goswami for distributing the nectar of the lotus feet of Govinda.

Om Ajnana Timiraandhasya Gyananjanishalakaya Chakshurunmilitam Jena Dasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnupadaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhaktivedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatya Deshatarine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nithyananda Shri Advaita Gadadhara Shiva Sadhigaura Bhakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session, we will be discussing from the 12th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Karmani Asmin Anashvase Dhooma Dhoomratmanam Bhavan Apayayati Govinda Pada Padmasavam Madhu The meaning of this verse is, "We have just begun the performance of this fruited, seductive activity, a sacrificial fire, without certainty of its result due to the many imperfections in our action. Our bodies have become black from the smoke, but we are factually pleased by the nectar of the lotus feet of the personative Godhead Govinda, which you are distributing."

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Fruitive activity means doing an activity the result of which we are doing an activity which is some type of material benefit or material enjoyment."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts fruitive activities, which aim for material benefits, with activities that lead to spiritual progress, emphasizing that fruitive sacrifices in this age are prone to imperfections and may not yield spiritual results.

So these are words spoken by the sages of Naimisharanya to the people of Godhead. They are glorifying Suta Goswami. You are distributing nectar of the lotus feet of Govinda, the Supreme Lord, and that is very pleasing to us. But as far as our own fruitive activity is concerned, what is the meaning of fruitive activity? Fruitive activity means doing an activity, the result of which... we are doing an activity, and the result of which we are doing an activity which is some type of material benefit or material enjoyment. That specifically, it's a technical term Prabhupada uses, fruitive activity. So this sacrificial fire they had lit up and they had begun a thousand year sacrifice, there was no certainty of its result because such a sacrifice is prone to be imperfect, especially in this age of Kali. So Srila Prabhupada will explain in the purport what are the imperfections of such a sacrifice being performed in this age of Kali. And the result of such a sacrifice is that one will get some material benefit or material pleasure, but one does not make any spiritual progress simply by performing such fruitive activities for millions and billions of lifetimes, nothing spiritual ever happens. So there's a distinct difference between such a sacrifice and such a sacrifice.

**Key Quote:** "The sacrificial fire kindled by the sages of Naimisha Aranya was certainly full of smoke and doubts because of so many flaws."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that sacrifices performed in Kali Yuga are often flawed due to the scarcity of qualified Brahmanas and that any discrepancy can spoil the entire sacrifice, making the results uncertain.

this material activities and devotional service. So Prabhupada explains in the purport, "The sacrificial fire kindled by the sages of Naimisha Aranya was certainly full of smoke and doubts because of so many flaws." Flaws means defects. The first flaw is that there is an acute scarcity of expert brahmanas able to carry out such performances successfully in this age of Kali. Kali Yuga, there is an acute scarcity, that means very, very, very difficult to find qualified brahmanas who can properly perform such fruitive activity, who can properly perform on the behalf of the yajaman. Just like you don't know how to perform such a sacrifice, then you can get a qualified Brahmana to do it on your behalf or guide you to perform it, but there is an acute scarcity of such brahmanas in this age of Kali. Kali Yuga, there is an acute scarcity of such brahmanas in this age of Kali Yuga, there is an acute scarcity of such brahmanas in this age of... not at all easy to find a qualified brahmana who can properly perform such sacrifices. Srila Prabhupada further explains, "Any discrepancy in such sacrifices spoils the whole show." Somewhere there is some discrepancy, some defect, some mistake, some shortcoming, then the whole sacrifice is spoilt and the result is uncertain, no guarantee of result. Even if somebody performs this sacrifice very meticulously, correctly, there is no guarantee of result. And Prabhupada compares it to agricultural enterprises, this is like agricultural enterprises, hmm.

**Key Quote:** "Performance of any kind of sacrifice in this age of Kali is also uncertain."
**Summary:** The speaker draws an analogy between agricultural enterprises dependent on rain and sacrifices in Kali Yuga, highlighting the uncertainty of results due to factors beyond human control, particularly the lack of qualified Brahmanas.

hmm hmm what is this comparison that is being done here? What is the relevance? Prabhupada says, "The good result of tilling the paddy field depends on providential rain." They till the paddy field and try to sow this paddy seeds to get rice, but the uncertainty is that there may be no rain. In spite of the farmer of farmers preparing that ground, there may be no rain, hmm. So rain is not under our control, rain is controlled by higher arrangement, hmm. So just like we don't have control over rain, so therefore our agriculture enterprise may be successful or not? May be successful or may be unsuccessful. If there is no rain it is unsuccessful, and rain is just one of the factors, there are many other factors also, but this uncertainty is certainly there, hmm. Similarly, performance of any kind of sacrifice in this age of Kali is also uncertain.

**Key Quote:** "In Kali Yuga it is particularly recommended that one should perform only one type of Yajna. What is that? The Sankirtan Yajna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that in Kali Yuga, the recommended sacrifice is Sankirtan Yajna, the congregational chanting of the holy name, due to the scarcity of qualified Brahmanas and the ineffectiveness of fruitive sacrifices.

Why? The primary reason is there is no qualified Brahmin, hmm. Unscrupulous, greedy Brahmin, there is no qualified Brahmin, hence the brahmanas of the age of Kali induce the innocent public to such uncertain sacrificial shows without disclosing the scriptural injunction that in the age of Kali there is no fruitful sacrificial performance, but the sacrifice of the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord. What does this mean? There are greedy Brahmin who want to make money from people. They don't tell the truth that you should not do any fruitive activities, you should not do any Karmakanda sacrifices. That they don't say. But the fact is, even if they don't say that, if somebody engages a Brahmana who is not perfect in performing such sacrifices, then there is zero spiritual benefit. That is one thing. And even material benefit is uncertain. Not too sure whether you will get material success or not. So therefore, the explanation by Prabhupada that in Kali Yuga it is particularly recommended that one should perform only one type of Yajna. What is that? The Sankirtan Yajna. And this Sankirtan Yajna primarily is

**Key Quote:** "Anyone who hears Krishna Katha from the right source, they immediately are able to perceive this result of hearing Krishna Katha."
**Summary:** The speaker compares the experience of devotional service to the satisfaction of eating when hungry, emphasizing that the results of hearing Krishna Katha are directly and practically perceived, leading to spiritual realization through Sankirtan Yajna.

Now Srila Prabhupada says, "One can feel this practically as one can feel the result of eating food." This example is given, 11th canto of the Bhagavatam. How do you experience the effect of or the result of performing devotional service? It is exactly like Bhagavatam says, "When you're very hungry, if you eat a nice nutritious, well-prepared, very tasty, nice food, then as you go on eating with every morsel..." morsel means this much, keep on eating, you experience three things. You experience mitigation of hunger, your hunger will subside, you experience you are getting more and more strength, and you also experience the pleasure of eating, you relish the taste of that food. So three things happen simultaneously. You nobody need tell you that you are actually, your hunger is getting mitigated, it is your personal experience, practically we experience that every day. So like that even bhakti is as directly experienced as simple things as eating. So anyone who hears Krishna Katha from the right source, they immediately are able to perceive this result of hearing Krishna Katha. And Srila Prabhupada says, "Spiritual realization acts in that way." That's the way of spiritualization in this age of Kali, Sankirtan Yagnam. And the results are practically perceived by anyone who sincerely engages

**Key Quote:** "The value of a moment's association with the devotee of the Lord cannot even be compared to the attainment of heavenly planets, or liberation from matter."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and emphasizes the importance of Srimad Bhagavatam verse 1.18.13, highlighting the incomparable value of associating with pure devotees over material achievements or liberation.

In this session, we discussed the 13th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Tulayama Lavenapi Nasvargam Napunarbhavam Bhagavatsangi Sangasya Martyanamkim Utashishaha. This is a very famous verse in the Bhagavatam. It's quoted many times later on in the Bhagavatam itself and even quoted by Srila Prabhupada on many different instances. So the meaning of this verse is: the value of a moment's association with the devotee of the Lord cannot even be compared to the attainment of heavenly planets, or liberation from matter. And what to speak of worldly benedictions in the form of material prosperity, which are for those who are meant for death.

**Key Quote:** "You cannot compare the immense benefit you get by moments association with a pure devotee you cannot compare that with the benefit of performing so many fructive activities to elevate oneself to heavenly planets or so many more fructive activities to actually get different kinds of material riches material benefits or even some kind of fructive activity for getting liberation from material bondage"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the verse, explaining that even a fraction of a second spent in the association of a pure devotee is more valuable than any material gain or impersonal liberation.

This is a very important verse, and it is helping us understand that we don't understand the future. What is the value of associating with a pure devotee, even for a very, very short time? Here, the Sanskrit word is lava. Lavena means lava is a measurement of a duration of time which is a fraction of a second. It's actually a moment, a very, very, very, very small bit of time. Even that, if somebody is able to properly associate with a sadhu, a pure devotee, for even a short time, that is very, very, very, very, very, very, very valuable. And how valuable? This verse is being spoken by the sages from the mission, and they are telling you, you cannot compare the immense benefit you get by a moment's association with a pure devotee. You cannot compare that with the benefit of performing so many fruitive activities to elevate oneself to heavenly planets, or so many more fruitive activities to actually get different kinds of material riches, material benefits, or even some kind of fruitive activity for getting liberation from material bondage, impersonal liberation. None of these are actually worthwhile for a person who's about to die, who is subject to death in this material world.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One cannot compare the association of a pure devotee to anything material...the result of either of these is material happiness and the result of association with pure devotee is transcendental pleasure"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada's purport, contrasting material happiness derived from fruitive activities and impersonal liberation with the transcendental pleasure gained from associating with pure devotees.

None of these are really beneficial. Why? Because Prabhupada explains in the purport. The purport of Prabhupada says, when there are some similar points, it is possible to compare one thing to another. You'll see the difference between the two. One cannot compare the association of a pure devotee to anything material. Men who are addicted to material happiness aspire to reach the heavenly planets like the moon, Venus, and Indra Loka. And those who are advanced in material philosophical speculations aspire after liberation from all material bondage. Broadly speaking, those who are non-devotees, their attempts at any other form of divine ultimate in the immo أفeki living man, everybody is in his own way of life, taking labor, all kind of pious activities which help one to go to the heavenly plans to take birth in heavenly pleasures. And the second group of activities are those by which one can get liberation from all material bondage. Here, liberation specifically refers to impersonal liberation, merging into Brahman. So both of these are actually, both these kinds of results are considered material benefits, material result, and this cannot be compared to association with a pure devotee because the result of either of these is material happiness.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The pure devotees of the Lord do not aspire after the happiness obtained in heavenly kingdom nor do they aspire after the liberation from material bondage pure devotees don't want this"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that pure devotees do not desire material enjoyment or impersonal liberation, as they find the pleasures of heavenly planets to be illusory and mundane.

And the result of association with a pure devotee is transcendental pleasure. So Srila Prabhupada says, when one becomes frustrated with all kinds of material advancement, one desires the opposite type of liberation, which is called a punar bhava, or no rebirth. One category of people are trying to enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, enjoying this material world, but the result of association with a pure devotee is transcendental pleasure. So Srila Prabhupada says one category of people are trying to enjoy, enjoy, enjoy in this material world, but when they realize actually we cannot enjoy in this material world, really real pleasure is not there, we have happiness not, then they try opposite. What is that? They try to avoid taking birth again. And how do they avoid taking birth again? By merging into the existence of the Supreme Lord, called the merging into Brahma Jyoti. But the pure devotees of the Lord do not aspire after the happiness obtained in heavenly kingdom, nor do they aspire after the liberation from material bondage. Pure devotees don't want this. Why? For the pure devotees of the Lord, the material pleasures obtainable in the heavenly parents are like phantasma Gorya. What is phantasma Gorya? It is something like some imaginary pleasure, some utopian ideal, like too much of promise, oh it's very nice, but actually experience that you find what, there is no real, not so much of happiness that I was

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that pure devotees are already liberated through devotional service, even while living in the material world, and are engaged in a transcendental existence.

I was thinking I will get. It is the same mundane pleasure available anywhere else in any other material situation, near the material facility, the same type of flickering momentary happiness. So heavenly pleasures are also the same quality. And the devotees, they are already, by devotional service, pure devotional service, they're already liberated from all material conceptions of pleasure and distress. They are liberated even while living in the material world. The pure devotees, they're already liberated, so why will they seek liberation? Why they want liberation? They're already liberated.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Devotional service is eternal...All these positions are finished with the body. When death comes, finished, over."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the eternal nature of devotional service with the temporary nature of material achievements, such as kingship or residence in heavenly planets, which end with the death of the body.

That means the pure devotees of the Lord are engaged in a transcendental existence, namely in the loving service of the Supreme Lord, both in the material world and in the spiritual world. This is a secret that many people do not know. A pure devotee's activities appear like ordinary activities of a materialistic person, but actually, a pure devotee's actions are all completely spiritual. And a pure devotee is only engaged in loving devotional service to Krishna, even while he is in the material world. So Prabhupada compares this pure devotee's activity with an example. As a garment servant is always the same, either in the office or at home, or at any place, so a devotee has nothing to do with that. He has nothing to do with anything material, for he is exclusively engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. Since he has nothing to do with anything material, what pleasure can he derive from material benedictions like kingship or other overlordships, which are finished quickly with the end of the body? Why will a pure devotee aspire for becoming a king, becoming an emperor, becoming a resident of heavenly planets, becoming even the king of heaven? Because all these positions are finished with the body. When death comes, finished, over.

**Summary:** The speaker reinforces the concept of the eternality of pure devotional service and the continuous, unbroken happiness experienced by those engaged in it, contrasting it with the temporary nature of material pleasures.

The positions are all temporal. Devotional service is eternal. This is a very, very important point. Pure devotional service, of course devotional service here means pure devotional service, it is eternal. That means there is no end. There is no stoppage. It has no end because it is spiritual. Anything spiritual has no end. Everything material has got an end. This Krishna describes in Bhagavad Gita: Adi antavanta kaunteya na teshu ramate buddhaha. All material pleasures have a beginning and end. Spiritual happiness, no beginning, no end. No beginning especially for those who are always engaged in transcendental loving service with the Lord. They are always happy, and their happiness continues without any break. They are always jolly.

**Key Quote:** "For eternal life, they are useless."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Suta Goswami speaking to the sages of Naimisharanya to illustrate that fruitive activities and Vedic study are useless for attaining eternal life compared to hearing and reciting the Bhagavatam.

They are always happy. Therefore, since the assets of a pure devotee are completely different from material assets, there is no comparison between the two. Suta Goswami was a pure devotee of the Lord. Suta Goswami is sitting and speaking Srimad Bhagavatam, the sage of Naimisharanaya. He was a pure devotee of the Lord, and therefore his association with the rishis in Naimisharanaya, the sage of Naimisharanaya is unique. So many. And the sages of Naimisharanaya are very highly qualified brahmanas. They know so much about different kinds of fruitive activities, different kinds of sacrifices, different kinds of study of the spiritual literature, Vedic literature. But none of them are useful for eternal life. They are useless. For eternal life, they are useless. Whereas, Suta Goswami, he is not going to narrate or describe any of those type of descriptions, how to do some material fruitive activity, how to attain impersonal liberation, none of those things.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply get association of a pure devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the negative effects of material entanglement and sense gratification with the positive benefits of Bhagavata Sangam, or association with the Lord's name, form, qualities, activities, and pure devotees.

He simply is reciting the Bhagavatam. In the material world, association with gross materialists is veritably condemned. So the materialist is called Yoshitsangi, or one who is very much attached to material entanglement. Materialists are like that. They are always after material pleasures, and they become entangled. What is this material entanglement? Women and other paraphernalia, they are always looking for sense gratification. So they want sense objects. Here, women means the object of enjoyment in terms of the opposite gender. For a man it is a woman, for a woman it is a man. Sex pleasure. And connected with sex pleasure, there are so many other pleasures: pleasure of eating, pleasure of sleeping, pleasure of enjoying different kinds of sense objects, all those kind of things. Such attachment is conditioned because it drives away the benedictions of life and prosperity. One becomes entangled means one is subject to a repetition of birth and death, because in one body, none of these types of enjoyments can all be experienced. So opposite of this Yoshitsanga is Bhagavata Sangam. Sorry, Bhagavata Sangam. One who is always in the association of Lord's, Supreme Lord's name, form, qualities, activities, pure devotees, etc. Such association is always desirable. Bhagavata Sangam. It is worshipable, it is praiseworthy, and one may accept it as the highest goal of life.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.14, emphasizing the inexhaustible nature of Krishna's topics and the unending satisfaction derived from hearing about Him.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 14th verse of the 18th chapter, the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Konama Tripyet Rasavit Kathayam Mahattamayikanta Parayanasya Nantam Gunanam Agunasya Jagmahu Yogeshwaraye Bhavapadma Mukhyaha. The meaning of this verse is, the Personality of God, the Personality of God and Lord Krishna, Govinda, is the exclusive shelter for all great living beings, and his transcendental attributes cannot even be measured by such masters of mystic powers as Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma. Can anyone who is expert in relishing nectar or rasa ever be fully satiated by hearing topics about him? This is spoken by the sages of Naimisha Araniyata Sutakoswami. Shri Krishna's disciples always tell us that Krishna's topics are so relishable that you go on hearing and you never become saturated. That means you never feel enough. I can't take anymore, I can't relish anymore.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material experiences, which lead to saturation, with the unending satisfaction derived from chanting the Hare Krishna mantra and hearing about Krishna.

No! It never happens. We have material experience. Anything which is very nice to eat or drink or anything which is light to the soul, meaning extremely goodigmatism, is nice to hear. Some material music, if it is very pleasing to hear the first time, then you may want to hear a second time. You hear a second time, then you may say, 'Oh, it's nice, I want to hear a third time.' How many times can you keep on hearing the same thing again and again and again? You cannot hear too many times. At a certain point, it becomes boring. You cannot hear any, it becomes saturated. The Hare Krishna mantra, on the other hand, devotees have been chanting for 10 years, 20 years, some devotees for 30 years. I've been chanting for 32 years. There are devotees who have been chanting for 50 years, 40 years. They never get saturated or satiated, they never get bored. So what is it about the Hare Krishna mantra that we go on singing, we go on hearing, we go on chanting, and we don't get bored or we don't get saturated? There is something about it which is different from all material songs, material...

Krishna's qualities are unlimited, wonderful qualities, all of them are wonderful qualities. Krishna has no tinge of any bad quality, only good qualities, and those qualities are innumerable. So if somebody tries to count how many good qualities Krishna has, even the masters of mystic powers like Shiva and Brahma, the topmost among the devatas, the topmost among all the personalities created in this world, Brahma and Shiva, they also cannot measure how many wonderful qualities Krishna has got. So Krishna is so full with so many...

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Lord Shiva drinking the ocean of poison to illustrate his immense mystic power, as an example of the powers that even great demigods possess.

wonderful qualities that he attracts everybody. This has been discussed when you discuss the atmanama verse in an earlier chapter. So Prabhupada explains in the purport, Lord Shiva and Lord Bhrama are two chiefs of the demigods. They are full of mystic powers. Among all the created beings who have mystic powers in this universe, the topmost personalities that possess maximum mystic powers are Shiva and Brahma. For example, the example is given by Prabhupada, Lord Shiva drank an ocean of poison, of which one drop was sufficient to kill an ordinary living being. Once the Devatas and the Asuras, they engaged in churning the milk ocean to generate nectar, but before the nectar was generated, some impurities were cleansed away, and those impurities took the form of poison which came out of the churning in the beginning of the churning. So that poison is a deadly poison, and it was unbearable for both the Devatas and the Asuras. So what to do with this poison now? So they requested Lord Shiva, 'Do something.' Shiva said, 'I don't know what to do with this poison now.' So they requested Lord Shiva, 'Do something.' Shiva said, 'Don't worry,' he just took the whole quantity of poison and just condensed it into one sip in his hand, and he just drank it off. Drank means he, he took it inside his mouth and held it in his throat. So therefore he got the name Neelakanta after he drank that poison, and he is holding that poison in his throat. He got the name Neelakanta, and his throat became bluish. So that is because he is holding that poison there in his throat, and it's a deadly poison, halahala, it's a deadly poison. So that is the mystic power of Shiva. Nobody can imitate Shiva, nobody can do that, holding the deadly poison in the throat without being...

Brahma, he is the secondary creator of this entire cosmic manifestation, that is the Maha Shiva station of this whole universe, but Brahma, he gives specifically the bodies for the living entities at the beginning of creation. So Brahma created all the powerful devatas, including Lord Shiva. So that is Brahma's mystic power, he can create big, big, big, big devatas, the most powerful devatas he can create. So they are Ishwaras, they are Lords of the universe, Brahma and Shiva particularly, two among the created beings. Two, of course, above them is Vishnu. Vishnu is not a created being, therefore among created beings, the topmost two personalities are Vishnu and Brahma. Brahma and Shiva, but they are not the supreme powerful, it is very important. Brahma and Shiva are not the supreme powerful. The supreme powerful is Govinda or Lord Krishna. He is the transcendence, and his transcendental attributes cannot be measured even by such powerful Ishwaras as Shiva and Brahma. Therefore, Lord Krishna is the exclusive shelter of the greatest...

of all the divine beings. Of all Brahma, of all living beings, Brahma and Shiva are a shelter of Lord Krishna because deservedly. Lord Krishna, Brahma is counted amongst the living beings, but is the greatest of all of us. Brahma is counted amongst the living beings, but he is the greatest of all of us. Why? He's the, is the greatest among all created living beings in this universe. Why? Is he attached to transcendental Krishna Gatha? Because Krishna is the reservoir of all pleasures. Enjoyment in this world, nobody can give as much enjoyment as discussing or hearing or remembering or talking about the pastimes of Krishna, which give so much transcendental happiness. Everyone wants to release some kind of taste in everything, but one who is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord can derive unlimited pleasure from such engagement. There are different kinds of activities people perform for getting some happiness, but the quantity of happiness available in any material activity is very, very less, and the quantity of happiness available in spiritual activities is unlimited. Why? Because the Lord is unlimited, his name, his attributes, his pastimes, his obligations, and his... are all very limited, and there are many more to be told in our life for being in this universe. So let us look at this when you entourage his variegatedness are all unlimited. Now, those who learn how to relish any of these Lord's holy name, or Lord's spiritual activities, or the Lord's spiritual qualities, if they learn to relish, then whoever relishes actually can relish unlimitedly. There is no limit, there is no satiation, there is no...

One of the names of the supreme absolute truth is Rama. Why? Because the yogis who are engaged in yogic practice, they get the unlimited transcendental pleasure by chanting the name of Rama. They derive unlimited pleasure from chanting the name or hearing body activities or remembering the pastimes of the Lord. So many ways, any devotional service they engage in pure devoted self, they derive unlimited happiness. So therefore the divine...

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the eagerness of both Suta Goswami to speak and the sages of Naimisaranya to hear about Krishna, creating a perfect environment for spiritual discourse.

this Suta Goswami, knowing this fact, he desired to continue the topics of Lord Krishna before the series name is Aranya, and the sages of name is Aranya also, they wholeheartedly agreed for this proposal. If you remember, in the end of the third chapter, the first canto, Suta Goswami completed answering six questions the sage Vamisharanya asked in the beginning of this Bhagavatam, and after finishing, he did not say, 'Now whatever you asked, I've answered, that's it, over, finished.' No, he completed answering, and he himself said, Suta Goswami said, 'Seeing your eagerness to hear about Krishna, I am now going to narrate to you the Srimad Bhagavatam which I heard from Shukadeva Goswami when Shukadeva Goswami is speaking to Parikshitmar.' So Suta Goswami is ready to recite, but what about the sages? Do they want to hear? Yes, they are telling, 'Kindly speak more, more and more and more, we are never saturated by hearing, there is no boredom, there is no satiation, so kindly go on speaking.' So both are like, Suta Goswami is eager to speak, and the sages are eager to hear. So this is the perfect ideal combination. I'll stop here, thank you very much.

### Krishna-katha, Qualified speaker, Qualified audience, Purity, Transcendental discourse

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The speaker should be a pure devotee of Krishna. The hearers should be eager to hear about Krishna only."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of a qualified speaker (a pure devotee of Krishna) and a qualified audience (eager to hear about Krishna) for a truly beneficial Krishna-katha discourse.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 15th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. तन्नो भवान्वै भगवत प्रधानो, महत्तमै कान्त परायनस्य, हरेर उदारं चरितं विशुद्धं, शुष्रू शताम् नो वितनो तु विद्वन। The meaning of this verse is, O Suta Goswami, you are a learned and pure devotee of the Lord, because the personality of Godhead is your chief object of service. Therefore, please describe to us the pastimes of the Lord, which are above all material conception, for we are anxious to receive such messages. The Sages of Manipur Taimisharanya are speaking to Suta Goswami. Suta Goswami has narrated how Pariksit Maharaj received the age of Kali, he punished and rewarded both, and now the events leading to Pariksit Maharaj meeting Sukadeva Goswami will be described, but before that, the discussion is centred around the topics for discussion. What kind of topics? Not merely some history, but specifically topics connected with the supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna. So, Krishna-katha is the important topic for discussion point here. So, Shri La Prabhupada says in the purport, the speaker on the transcendental activities of the Lord should have only one object of worship and service, Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So, it's very important from whom we hear. If at all we engage in hearing about Krishna Katha, then from whom do we hear? Who is the speaker? It's very important. So, here Shri La Prabhupada is telling the speaker on the transcendental activities of the Lord, what kind of person should he be? He should be a person who has only one object of worship and service. That only object is Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That means, such a person should be a pure devotee of Krishna. That is the intended meaning here. And the audience for such topics should be anxious to hear about him. Him refers to Krishna. The speaker and the hearers. The speaker should be a pure devotee of Krishna. The hearers should be eager to hear about Krishna only. So, only when such a combination is possible, namely, a qualified speaker and a qualified audience, it is then and there very much congenial to continue discourses on the transcendence. Subject matter of Krishna is not exactly relishable if the speaker is not a pure devotee and the audience is not exactly eager to hear about Krishna Katha.

### Professional speakers, Material intention, Bhagavata Saptaha, Earning money, Materially engrossed audience

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Professional speakers have got a material intention, material benefit in their mind because of which they engage in speaking, so for them it is a means of earning money."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts pure devotees with professional speakers who have material intentions and a materially absorbed audience, highlighting that such discourses do not serve the true purpose of hearing Bhagavatam.

Both the speaker and the hearers should be qualified, that is being said here. Now there is, there are other kinds of speakers other than a pure devotee speaker. What are they called? They are called professional speakers. So Srila Prabhupada writes about these professional speakers because this is elaborately explained in Chaitanya Charitamrita. So what does Prabhupada say here? Professional speakers and a materially absorbed audience cannot derive real benefit from such discourses. So who are these professional speakers? Professional speakers have got a material intention, material benefit in their mind because of which they engage in speaking. So for them it is a means of earning money. Speaking on Bhagavatam is yet another means of earning money. There are so many ways people earn money in this world, but speaking Bhagavatam also has become in recent times a way of earning money. So such a speaker is called a professional speaker. And the audience, if they are materially engrossed, then their purpose of hearing Bhagavatam is not at all the purpose for which one should actually hear Bhagavatam. Just like the sage Naimisharanya, their purpose of hearing Bhagavatam is exclusively hearing about Krishna. They are very eager to hear about Krishna. This is noted by Suta Goswami right in the beginning of the Bhagavatam itself in the first canto. Suta Goswami said, I am noticing that all of you are very eager to hear about Krishna.

### Suta Goswami, Sage Naimisharanya, Shukadeva Goswami, Pariksit Maharaj, Bhagavata Saptaha, Daily hearing
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/ECsl2cFFhYs?t=465

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "They don't consider the fact that Bhagavatam says daily you must hear Bhagavatam. If you are serious about spiritual benefit. If you are serious about spiritual advancement by hearing Bhagavatam. You must hear Bhagavatam every day."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Suta Goswami spoke because the sages were eager to hear about Krishna, and that Shukadeva Goswami spoke for one week only because Pariksit Maharaj had limited time, emphasizing that daily hearing of Bhagavatam is essential for spiritual advancement, contrasting this with the show of Bhagavata Saptaha by professional speakers.

Therefore, let me recite to you the Srimad Bhagavatam which I heard from Sukadeva Goswami. How did Suta Goswami decide to speak on Bhagavatam? It is because the audience, the hearers, the sage Naimisharanya, they were very eager to hear about Krishna. So Suta Goswami said, he is very pleased to get an opportunity to speak in front of such an audience. So the materially absorbed audience, they are not exactly eager to hear about Krishna. So if either the speaker or the hearers or the audience, they are not eager to hear about Krishna, or they are not purely devotees or they are not persons on a pure devotional path, then there cannot be real spiritual benefit from such a discourse. Professional speakers make a show of Bhagavat Saptaha for the sake of family maintenance. This is exactly what is meant by professional speakers. They are trying to imitate Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami spoke Bhagavatam for one week, Saptaha, one week, because Pariksit Maharaj had only one week's time before quitting his body. There is a very, very specific reason why Shukadeva Goswami spoke for only one week, because Pariksit Maharaj who was asking questions, inquiring from Shukadeva Goswami, he had only one week. That will be explained in this chapter as we go further. Therefore, Shukadeva Goswami spoke only for one week. It is not that Shukadeva Goswami, without a reason, he simply decided let me speak one week. No. So, the professional speakers whose main intention is money, they make a show of Bhagavata Saptaha. They try to imitate Shukadeva Goswami. They don't consider the fact that Bhagavatam says daily you must hear Bhagavatam. If you are serious about spiritual benefit. If you are serious about spiritual advancement by hearing Bhagavatam, you must hear Bhagavatam every day. It's called Seva. It's called Seva. It's a service. It's a devotional service to hear Bhagavatam. And Nityam means every day, constantly, always. At least for us who have got so many other engagements, we should at least hear every day for a little time. Not just one week. No. That was only for Pariksit Maharaj, because he had only one week's time.

**Key Quote:** "Even the Bhagavatam discourses could be contaminated by the gunas."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the audience is often interested in material benefits (Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha) and how the intent of earning money or gaining material benefit can pollute the pure Bhagavatam discourse, contaminating it with the three gunas.

So, these professional speakers make a show of Bhagavata Saptaha for the sake of family maintenance. The real intention is money. And the materially disposed audience hears such discourses of Bhagavata Saptaha for some material benefit. The audience also, many times, they are really interested in material benefit by hearing Bhagavatam. And what is that material benefit? Religiosity, wealth, gratification of the senses or liberation. Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha. This is their aim, to attain one or more of these four things. Such a Bhagavatam discourse, or such Bhagavatam discourses, are not purified from the contamination of the material qualities. Always remember, everything in this material world is contaminated by the three gunas. So, even the Bhagavatam discourses could be contaminated by the gunas. Bhagavatam by itself is pure, but it can get contaminated by such intent of earning money or getting material benefit. It gets polluted.

### Purity, Transcendental pleasure, Material motive, Transformation, Qualified speaker and hearers

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Neither the sages are interested in any material gain. Nor Suta Goswami is interested in any material benefit. So, therefore the speaker and audience are both pure."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the pure discourses between the saints of Naimisharanya and Suta Goswami with modern Bhagavata Saptahas, emphasizing that without purity and a lack of material motive, there can be no real spiritual transformation.

So, here Prabhupada is warning us, but the discourses between the saints of Naimisharanya and Sri Suta Goswami are on the transcendental level, above all material contamination. They are pure. There is no motive for material gain. This is the important point. Neither the sages are interested in any material gain, nor Suta Goswami is interested in any material benefit. So, therefore the speaker and audience are both pure. In such discourses, transcendental pleasure, unlimited transcendental pleasure is relished both by the audience and by the speaker. And therefore they can continue the topics for many thousands of years. Why is Prabhupada saying this? Because if you remember, the beginning of the Bhagavatam it is said, the sages of Naimisharanya assembled in that holy place, performed one thousand year sacrifice. So, for one thousand years, what sacrifice are they doing? They are performing the sacrifice of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord. So only if there is no material motive, motive for material gain, and there is no money intention, intention of earning money by the speaker, then only the transcendent, unlimited transcendental pleasure can be realized by, or relished by both the audience and the speaker. And then it can continue. There is no time limitation. Now Bhagavata Saptas are held for only seven days, and after finishing the show, both the audience and the speaker become engaged in material activities as usual. They go back to their usual material activities. There is no change of heart. There is no transformation. So, it is explained here, both the, nowadays, both the speaker and the hearers are not exactly pure or qualified. So, there can't be that spiritual transformation in such a condition. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.16, explaining that the sages of Naimisharanya are requesting Suta Goswami to speak about the topics that led Maharaj Parikshit to attain the lotus feet of the Lord, emphasizing the importance of pure intention.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 16th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Savaimahabhagavata Parikshit Yena apavarga aakhyam adabhra buddhihi Jnanena vayasaki shabditena Bhaje khagendra dhwaja padamoolam. The meaning of this verse is: O Suta Goswami, please describe those topics of the Lord by which Maharaj Parikshit, whose intelligence was fixed on liberation, attained the lotus feet of the Lord who is the shelter of Garuda, the king of birds. Those topics were vibrated by the son of Vyasa, Srila Sukadeva. So the sages of Naimisharanya are specifically requesting Suta Goswami to now speak about those topics which were discussed by Parikshit Maharaj and Sukadeva Goswami with the intention of attaining shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna. That should be the only intent.

**Key Quote:** "The devotee of the Lord worships the transcendental form of the Lord... Whereas the impersonalist meditates upon the glaring effulgence of the bodily rays of the Lord known as the Brahmajyoti."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the difference between impersonalists and devotees, highlighting that devotees worship the transcendental form of the Lord, while impersonalists meditate on the Brahmajyoti, the Lord's bodily effulgence, and emphasizes that Parikshit Maharaj's goal was the lotus feet of the Lord, not impersonal Brahman.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "There is some controversy amongst the students on the path of liberation." Such transcendental students are known as impersonalists and devotees of the Lord. Two categories of transcendentalists are generally there among those who desire a transcendental benefit. Two kinds of transcendentalists, the impersonalists and the devotees. The devotee of the Lord worships the transcendental form of the Lord. Devotees always worship the transcendental form of the Lord. They don't engage in any idol worship. They don't worship any material form. They don't worship any imaginary form. They don't worship idols. Idol means imaginary form. Whereas the impersonalist meditates upon the glaring effulgence of the bodily rays of the Lord known as the Brahmajyoti. Always the impersonalist, their goal is the impersonal Brahmajyoti, which is the effulgence of the Supreme Lord Krishna, His bodily effulgence. So their object of meditation is the impersonal effulgence, Brahmajyoti. Here in this verse, it is said that Maharaj Pariksit attained the lotus feet of the Lord by the instructions in knowledge delivered by the son of Vyasadeva, Srila Sukhdev Goswami. So Maharaj Pariksit's goal was the lotus feet of the Lord, not some impersonal Brahman effulgence, not some Brahmajyoti, not some spiritual sky. No. His aim was very clear.

**Key Quote:** "Sukhdev Goswami in the beginning was an impersonalist... But later on, he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus became a devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Sukadeva Goswami was initially an impersonalist but later became a devotee after being attracted to the Lord's pastimes, emphasizing the importance of hearing about the Lord and the transformative power of devotional service, referencing the Atmarama verse.

Sukhdev Goswami was also an impersonalist in the beginning, as he himself admitted in the Bhagavatam, Second canto, first chapter, ninth verse. But later on, he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus became a devotee. This is a very, very important point. Sukhdev Goswami in the beginning was an impersonalist. That means he had realization of the impersonal aspect of the absolute truth, Brahman realized. He was a Brahman realized person, and he was a liberated soul by birth. That's a fact. But he did not know about the personality of Godhead. He did not know about the Bhagavan feature. He only knew the Brahman feature. And he himself has admitted in the beginning of the Bhagavatam that he was an impersonalist. Later on, he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and thus became a devotee. There is a verse called the Atmarama verse. That verse describes all varieties of Atmaramas. They are attracted by the Supreme Lord Krishna and they become devotees, and they do render pure devotional service to Krishna, irrespective of what their background might have been. So similarly, Sukhdev Goswami, even though he was a liberated soul, even though he was absorbed in thought of Brahman, still, he got attracted to the transcendental pastimes of the Lord when he heard them from his father Vyasadeva. So he heard the pastimes

**Key Quote:** "Such devotees with perfect knowledge are called Mahabhagavatas or first class devotees... There are three classes of devotees and they are called Prakrita, Madhyama and Mahabhagavata."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the three classes of devotees: Prakrita (third class), Madhyama (second class), and Mahabhagavata (first class), explaining their characteristics and how they perceive and interact with the Lord, devotees, neophytes, and non-devotees.

So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "Such devotees with perfect knowledge are called Mahabhagavatas or first class devotees." Like Sukhdev Goswami, Pariksit Maharaj, they are all Mahabhagavatas, first class devotees. So Srila Prabhupada further says, there are three classes of devotees and they are called Prakrita, Madhyama and Mahabhagavata. Three classes of devotees. The Prakrita or third class devotees are temple worshippers without specific knowledge of the Lord and the Lord's devotees. The lowest level of devotees is called third class devotees, Prakrita Bhakta. And what is their characteristic? They worship the Lord in the temple but they do not have specific knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They do not have specific knowledge of the Supreme Lord's pure devotees. Then, the second class devotee or Madhyama knows well the Lord, the Lord's devotees, the neophytes, and the non-devotees also. So four distinct categories of personalities are distinguished by those in the intermediate stage, Madhyama Adhikari or second class devotee. The four stages are four stages in which different personalities are situated. The topmost is the Lord himself, the Supreme Personality, then the Lord's devotees, established devotees, and the neophytes, those who are just beginning devotional service. And finally, the non-devotees. They are neither interested nor they engage in any devotional service. So such non-devotees are the fourth class of people in this world in the view of the Madhyama Adhikari, the second class devotee. And the second class devotee accordingly deals

**Key Quote:** "But the Mahabhagavata or the first class devotee sees everything in relation with the Lord and the Lord present in everyone's relation."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unique vision of a Mahabhagavata, who sees everything connected to the Lord and the Lord present in every relationship, leading them to not distinguish between devotees and non-devotees, as they perceive everyone serving the Lord in their own way.

But the Mahabhagavata or the first class devotee sees everything in relation with the Lord and the Lord present in everyone's relation. This is a special qualification of a Mahabhagavata devotee. What is that? A Mahabhagavata devotee always sees everything in relation with the Lord. Everything actually is connected with the Lord. Nothing is independent of the Lord. So Mahabhagavata is able to see that. And not only everything is connected with the Lord, but the Lord is present in everyone's relation. There is no relationship in which Lord is absent. So Lord is connected with everybody. Everything is connected with the Lord. Both ways. The Mahabhagavata therefore does not make any distinction particularly between a devotee and non-devotee. This is a very peculiar qualification of a Mahabhagavata. He does not make a distinction between devotees and non-devotees. Why? Because his vision is everyone is engaged in their service to the supreme personality of God. That's the way a Mahabhagavata sees everyone engaged. So Mahabhagavata does not make a distinction between a devotee and a non-devotee.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit was such a Mahabhagavata devotee because he was initiated by a Mahabhagavata devotee, Shukadeva Swami."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Pariksit Maharaj became a Mahabhagavata due to being initiated by Sukadeva Goswami, and emphasizes that while impersonalists can become devotees, devotees never become impersonalists, highlighting the superiority of devotional service.

A Madhyama Adhikari, intermediate devotee, he makes distinction between devotees and non-devotees. Maharaj Pariksit was such a Mahabhagavata devotee because he was initiated by a Mahabhagavata devotee, Shukadeva Swami. So how did Pariksit Maharaj become a Mahabhagavata? Because he was initiated by Shukadeva Swami. So he also became a Mahabhagavata. So Pariksit's qualifications are being described here. What category of person is Pariksit? He was equally kind even to the personality of Kali, and what to speak of others. Such a kind-hearted soul, Pariksit Maharaj. He was kind to Kali Purusha because Kali Purusha surrendered, and what to speak of others who are not as fallen as Kali Purusha. So a Mahabhagavata devotee, he is equally kind to everybody. That is one of his qualifications or characteristics. So Srila Prabhupada says further, there are many instances in the transcendental histories of the world of an impersonalist who has later become a devotee. Many instances. Shukadeva Goswami, the Kumaras. But a devotee has never become an impersonalist. Somebody who has taken to devotional service and perfected his devotional service

**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita to illustrate that those attached to the impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth face more suffering, reinforcing the idea that impersonal realization is an intermediate stage and that devotional service is the ultimate goal.

he becomes situated on the transcendental platform, eternally he remains on the transcendental platform. So Prabhupada says this very fact proves that on the transcendental steps, the step occupied by a devotee is higher than the step occupied by an impersonalist. That means that impersonal realization is an intermediate position of a progressive transcendentalist. It is also stated in the Bhagavad Gita in the twelfth chapter of Bhagavad Gita in the fifth verse purport that person stuck on the impersonal step undergo more sufferings than achievement of reality. Even the verse says, "Those who are attached to is avyakta impersonal aspect of the absolute truth, for them there is so much of difficulty on the path of impersonal realization that they have to undergo." And in the end, they don't get the realization. They don't get that realization which they are entitled to. Therefore knowledge imparted by Sukhadeva Goswami unto Maharaj Pariksit

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the knowledge imparted by Sukadeva Goswami through the Srimad Bhagavatam helped Pariksit Maharaj attain the transcendental service of the Lord, which is the perfect stage of liberation, and ends with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

This is the kind of knowledge that was imparted by Sukhadeva Goswami. He spoke the Srimad Bhagavatam. And this stage of perfection is called apavarga or the perfect stage of liberation. So in this stage of liberation, there is actual freedom from material bonding because of which they are factually liberated. So simple knowledge of liberation is material knowledge, whereas when somebody attains the transcendental service of the Lord, that is called the perfect stage of liberation. So Sukhadeva Goswami, he gave perfect knowledge to Pariksit Maharaj, and the result was that Pariksit Maharaj attained the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 17th and 18th verses of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavata. To begin with, I will recite the 17th verse. Tanna parampuñña asamrutartham ākhyānam atyadbhuta yoganiṣṭham ākhyāhi ananta ācharitopa pannam pārīkṣitam bhāgavata ābirāmam. The meaning of this verse is: Thus, please narrate to us the narrations of the unlimited, for they are purifying and supreme. They were spoken to Maharaj Pariksit and they are very dear to the pure devotees being full of Bhakti Yoga. So, the sages of Naimisharanya are requesting Suta Goswami to speak about those topics discussed between Pariksit Maharaj and Sukadeva Goswami. And what is the nature of those topics? They are purifying and supreme. They are very dear to pure devotees, these topics, because they are full of Bhakti Yoga. They are pure devotees. These topics are full of Bhakti Yoga. So, Prabhupada explains in the purport, what are spoken to Maharaj Pariksit and what is very dear to the pure devotees is Srimad Bhagavatam. Srimad Bhagavatam is mainly full of the narrations of the activities of the supreme unlimited and therefore, it is the science of Bhakti Yoga or the devotional service of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Srimad Bhagavatam contains transcendental knowledge, renunciation, and real religion, but most importantly, devotional service. He then introduces the eighteenth verse, highlighting Suta Goswami's statement about being born in a mixed caste and the power of association with advanced souls to cleanse oneself of disqualifications.

Thus, it is para or supreme. Because, although it is enriched with all kinds of knowledge and religion, it is specifically enriched with the devotional service of the Lord. That is a special characteristic of Bhagavatam. It contains transcendental knowledge. It contains topics of renunciation. It contains what is real religion. But most importantly, it contains devotional service of the supreme Lord, Bhakti Yoga. It is enriched with Bhakti Yoga. The eighteenth verse.

The meaning is, Sri Sathya Goswami said, he is responding to whatever the sage Suna Mishra has said now, O God, although we are born in a mixed caste, we are still promoted in birthright simply by serving and following the great who are advanced in knowledge. Even by conversing with such great souls, one can without delay cleanse oneself of all disqualifications resulting

**Key Quote:** "Higher association means all disqualifications are washed away."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Suta Goswami's background and how association with higher devotees like Sukadeva Goswami purified him. He then connects this principle to Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who elevated many low-born individuals to the status of devotional service and acaryas through transcendental association.

from lower births. So, Suta Goswami is revealing some secret here, a very, very important secret. What is he telling? That he was born in a mixed caste, viloma-jātāha, born in a mixed caste. So, Srila Prabhupāda explains what is that born in a mixed caste. In the purport, Srila Prabhupāda says, Suta Goswami did not take his birth in a brāhmaṇa family. He was born in a family of mixed caste or an uncultured low family. So, Suta means somebody who is born in an uncultured low family is called a Suta. But because of higher association, like Sri Śukadeva Goswami and the great sages of Naimishāraṇya, certainly the disqualification of inferior birth was washed off. There is a power of association. Higher association means all disqualifications are washed away. And it actually happened to Suta Goswami. So, Srila Prabhupāda explains the principle that Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu followed this principle in pursuance of the Vedic youth sages. And by his transcendental association, he elevated many low-born or those disqualified by birth or action to the status of devotional service and established them in the position of ācāryas or authorities.

### Caitanya Mahaprabhu, spiritual master, qualification

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If he is conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa, then he can be accepted as ācārya or guru, or a spiritual master."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Caitanya Mahaprabhu strictly followed the principle that anyone conversant with the science of Krishna can be accepted as an acarya or guru, regardless of their birth or social status.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu strictly followed this principle of the Bhagavatam. Just like Suta Goswami became qualified, and he became cleansed of all disqualifications simply by associating with pure devotees. Same thing, Caitanya Mahāprabhu himself gave association and he elevated those who were disqualified by birth or action to the status of devotional service. And when they become situated on this platform of pure devotional service, they become authorities. They attain the position of ācāryas, those who can teach others by their own example. They are perfect in knowledge and realization. So, Caitanya Mahāprabhu clearly stated, any man, whatever he may be, whether a brāhmaṇa or a śūdra, by birth, or a householder or a mendicant in the order of society, if he is conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa, he can be accepted as an ācārya or guru, a spiritual master. The exact verse is, kibha vipra kibha nyāsi śūdra kenanāya yehi kṛṣṇa tattvaveta sei guru hoya. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's statement. This means, irrespective of the position, either in the varṇa or the āśrama, varṇa positions, the highest is brāhmaṇa, the lowest is śūdra. So, Caitanya Mahāprabhu says it doesn't matter what the varṇa position is of a person. Neither the āśrama position, whether one is householder or mendicant in the order of society, that means whether one is grāṣṭa or sannyāsi, it doesn't matter. If he is conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa, yehi kṛṣṇa tattvaveta, kṛṣṇa tattva, in truth he knows what is Kṛṣṇa, then he can be accepted as ācārya or guru, or a spiritual master.

### Suta Goswami, knowledge of Krishna, authority

**Key Quote:** "Suta Goswami learned the science of Kṛṣṇa from great rishis and authorities like Śukadeva and Vyāsadeva. And he was so qualified, that even the sages of Naimisharanya eagerly wanted to hear from him the science of Kṛṣṇa in the form of Srimad Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Suta Goswami's qualification as a speaker of Srimad Bhagavatam, despite his low birth, due to his learning from Sukadeva Goswami and Vyasadeva. Even high-class brahmanas were eager to hear from him because of his realized knowledge of Krishna.

So, Caitanya Mahāprabhu followed this very rigidly. This principle, he followed this principle. Now, it is described here, Suta Goswami learned the science of Kṛṣṇa from great rishis and authorities like Śukadeva and Vyāsadeva. And he was so qualified, that even the sages of Naimisharanya eagerly wanted to hear from him the science of Kṛṣṇa in the form of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, Suta Goswami, by birth he was a low-born, but he learned the science of Kṛṣṇa from Śukadeva Goswami, from Vyāsadeva, and in this way he became qualified. And how much qualified did he become? That even the sages of Naimisharanya, who were high-class brāhmaṇas, atappumbir dvijaśreṣṭhā, Suta Goswami himself addresses the sages of Naimisharanya, you are dvijaśreṣṭhā, you are high-class brāhmaṇas. Even such high-class brāhmaṇas, they are eager to hear from Suta Goswami about Kṛṣṇa, because Suta Goswami knows and has realized the science of Kṛṣṇa. That's why he is in that exalted position of being the ācārya, to impart knowledge about Kṛṣṇa. So, Prabhupāda says, Suta Goswami had the double association of great souls by hearing and preaching. He heard them when they made inquiries, and he answered their questions by which he was preaching to them also.

### learning, preaching, qualification

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "By learning one acquires some qualification, and by preaching one acquires a higher qualification."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that both learning and preaching the science of Krishna consciousness are essential for acquiring qualifications, with preaching leading to a higher level of qualification. He emphasizes that Suta Goswami's example proves that there was no bar to learning or preaching transcendental science due to inferior birth.

Transcendental science, or the science of Kṛṣṇa, has to be learned from the authorities, from somebody who is following these principles taught by Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. So, learning is not enough. One has to preach the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and then one becomes still more qualified. By learning one acquires some qualification, and by preaching one acquires a higher qualification. So, Suta Goswami had both the advantages, and thus undoubtedly he was completely freed from all disqualifications, low birth and mental agonies. So, Suta Goswami cannot be considered as low born. Those disadvantages are all cleansed away. This verse definitely proves that Śrīla Śukadeva Goswami did not refuse to teach Suta Goswami about the transcendental science, nor did the sages of Naimishāna refuse to hear lessons from Suta Goswami, because of his inferior birth. See, both are there. Suta Goswami though low born, Śukadeva Goswami spoke Bhāgavatam, and Suta Goswami heard, and became enlightened, qualified. And the sages of Naimishāna, even though they are high class brāhmaṇas, they did not refuse to hear from Suta Goswami, because their only consideration was this: Suta Goswami actually has heard about Kṛṣṇa and knows Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, let us hear from Him. That was their only consideration. So, Prabhupāda says one important point. This means that thousands of years ago, there is no bar to learning or preaching the transcendental science because of inferior birth.

### caste system, qualification, association

**Key Quote:** "Birth is not important, but the qualification of the person after taking birth, whatever be the family, if they acquire the qualifications by proper hearing, then they are washed off all the contamination of the lower birth."
**Summary:** The speaker refutes the idea that lower castes were historically denied transcendental knowledge, stating that the rigidity of the caste system is a relatively recent phenomenon. He concludes that qualification, acquired through proper hearing and association with pure devotees, is more important than birth, and that such association cleanses one of all contamination.

Many times these ignorant people, they accuse that in the past, so-called śūdras were denied the knowledge of the Vedas. They were denied transcendental knowledge. No, that's never true. That's never true. As Prabhupāda says, there was never any bar for learning or preaching the transcendental science because of low birth. The rigidity of the so-called caste system in Hindu society became prominent within only one hundred years or so, when the number of dvija bandhus or disqualified men in the families of higher caste increased. Prabhupāda is clearly pointing out in the last hundred years or so, that is, if you count from now, when Prabhupāda is writing the purport, he says last hundred years this has become so, vitiated caste system, Hindu caste system. But that was not the case before. So, how did this happen in the last hundred years or hundred and fifty years? Because the number of disqualified people taking birth in higher caste increased. And then, such disqualified people, they don't have qualification, they claim, I am a brāhmaṇa by birth. But without qualification, what is the use of such birth? It is useless. It is no good. So, therefore, Prabhupāda explains that birth is not important, but the qualification of the person after taking birth, whatever be the family, if they acquire the qualifications by proper hearing, then they are washed off all the contamination of the lower birth. So, this is the conclusion that more important than birth is the association through which one actually becomes elevated, association of pure devotees, association of great ācāryas, one becomes elevated, cleansed of all contamination. And one becomes qualified to speak such transcendental subject matter to others who may not be conversant with it. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "It completely purifies all contamination and elevates them directly to the transcendental platform to become pure devotees."
**Summary:** Suta Goswami describes the potency of chanting the holy name of the Lord, emphasizing its ability to purify and elevate individuals to a transcendental platform.

In this session we are discussing from the 19th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. Kutap Unar Grunato Namatasya Mahatam Aikanta Parayanasya Yo Ananta Shaktir Bhagavanananto Mahat Gunatvadhyam Anantam Ahuhu. The meaning of this verse is: And what to speak of those who are under the direction of the great devotees chanting the holy name of the unlimited who has unlimited potency. The personality of Godhead, unlimited in potency and transcendental by attributes, is called the Ananta or unlimited. So here Suta Goswami is describing the potency of chanting the holy name of the unlimited Lord. What is that potency? It completely purifies all contamination and elevates them.

**Key Quote:** "Srimad Bhagavatam asserts that one who chants the holy name of the Lord and the direction of a pure devotee can at once get free from the disadvantages due to a lower caste birth."
**Summary:** Prabhupada addresses arguments against lower-caste individuals becoming Brahmanas, asserting that chanting the holy name under the guidance of a pure devotee can overcome disadvantages due to birth.

So in the purport, Prabhupada says, the Dvija Bandhu, or the less intelligent uncultured men born of higher caste, put forward many arguments against the lower caste men becoming Brahmanas in this life. They argue that birth in a family of Shudras or less than Shudras is made possible by one's previous sinful acts and that one therefore has to complete the terms of disadvantages due to lower birth. What does it mean? If somebody is taking birth in a Shudra family, that is because of their past sinful activities or past life, karma. So there is a basis for somebody to take birth in a Shudra family and somebody else to take birth in a Brahmana family. Yes, agreed. There is a definite basis for such birth to happen. It is not accidental, it is not blind, no. The argument by those born in Brahmin families, they say that if somebody is taken such a birth, they have to complete the life in that body that they have acquired. And only in the next birth, if they take birth in a Brahmana family, then they may be accepted as a Brahmana. Not before that, but here something else is told. So Prabhupada says to answer these false logicians, Srimad Bhagavatam asserts that one who chants the holy name of the Lord and the direction of a pure devotee can at once get free from the disadvantages due to a lower caste birth. Even though some, we may admit that somebody born in a low class family due to their past misdeeds or past karma, still, when they chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord under the direction of a pure devotee, they become free from all such material contamination due to the low birth.

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee of the Lord does not commit any offense while chanting the holy name of the Lord."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses the characteristics of a pure devotee, emphasizing offenseless chanting and highlighting offenses against the holy name.

A pure devotee of the Lord does not commit any offense while chanting the holy name of the Lord. It is a characteristic of a pure devotee. It is a characteristic of a pure devotee. His chanting is pure. It means no offenses. What is the meaning of offense? Offense is like blaspheming devotees who have dedicated their life for preaching Krishna consciousness. That is an offense against the holy name. Or criticizing or minimizing the value of Vedic literature. This is also an offense against the holy name. Like that. There are different offenses to be considered while chanting Hare Krishna. And if somebody while chanting does not commit any offense, such a person is actually a pure devotee of the Lord. So, Prabhupada says there are ten different offenses in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. This is an elaborate subject, but separately we can discuss what are the ten offenses and how to avoid them. There are ten different offenses mentioned in the Padma Purana. To chant the holy name under the direction of a pure devotee is offenseless chanting.

**Summary:** The importance of chanting under the direction of a pure devotee is emphasized, stating that it leads to immediate purification from sinful reactions.

When anyone tries to chant the Hare Krishna mantra under the direction of a pure devotee, simply by following the instructions of a pure devotee and chanting under his direction, once chanting becomes pure, once chanting becomes offenseless, offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Lord is transcendental. And therefore, such chanting can at once purify one, at once purify a person from the effects of all kinds of previous sins. The sins get washed away. The residual sinful reactions are washed away, no matter how much it may be. That's the special thing about chanting under the direction of a pure devotee. That's very special. So therefore, we request everyone, you please receive the holy name from Prabhupada and you chant according to his instructions and directions. Okay. Then immediately you become purified of all sinful reactions.

**Key Quote:** "Offenseless chanting means the person who is chanting in that way has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name."
**Summary:** The lecture stresses the need to give up sin and endeavor to chant under proper guidance, explaining that offenseless chanting indicates understanding the transcendental nature of the holy name and surrendering to the Lord.

But one should not again commit sins after being cleansed by simply chanting Hare Krishna according to Prabhupada's directions. It is not mechanical. It's not automatic. One has to endeavor to give up sin. To give up the sinful activities and then chant the Hare Krishna mantra under proper guidance and direction, then one can derive the highest benefit. The offenseless chanting indicates that one is purified. It indicates that one has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name and has thus surrendered unto the Lord. How does all this work? That's what Prabhupada is explaining here. Offenseless chanting means the person who is chanting in that way has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name. The holy name when uttered by any person simply by vibrating the tongue, Hare Krishna, the holy name is uttered. Hare Krishna. Then it's no ordinary sound vibration. It is actually transcendental sound. But a devotee who chants offenselessly, he understands the spiritual nature of the holy name. And what does he do consequently? He surrenders completely to the supreme law.

**Key Quote:** "If a person stops sinning and takes to Krishna consciousness and follows the directions of the pure devotee and chants Hare Krishna, then guaranteed such persons will become pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that birth and past sinful activities do not matter if one takes to Krishna consciousness, follows a pure devotee's directions, and chants Hare Krishna, emphasizing the power of the holy name.

If somebody chants the Hare Krishna mantra under superior guidance, so therefore we have to clearly understand birth doesn't matter, past life of sinful activities does not matter. If a person stops sinning and takes to Krishna consciousness and follows the directions of the pure devotee and chants Hare Krishna, then guaranteed such persons will become pure devotees. Now here the glories of the holy name. The holy name of the Lord is as powerful as the Lord. It looks like a very simple sound, Hare Krishna, two, two syllables. Anybody can vibrate the tongue and say Hare Krishna. But that sound, when somebody produces the sound Hare Krishna, that sound is actually very, very powerful, pure, transcendental sound. It's definitely potent like that. So Prabhupada says the Lord is all powerful personality of Godhead and he has innumerable names which are all non-different from him and are equally powerful also. Because the Lord is absolute. There is no difference between his personal names.

**Summary:** The lecture explains that the Lord's names are identical to Him and equally powerful, emphasizing that surrendering to the Lord and chanting His holy name protects one from all sinful reactions.

according to his activities also. So, this way he has so many names, unlimited names, because activities are unlimited, qualities are unlimited. So, such names are identical with the Lord, and they are also very, very powerful, as powerful as he is. So therefore, Prabhupada says, in the last word of the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord asserts that one who surrenders fully to the Lord, he will not be able to do anything. Therefore, Prabhupada says, in the last word of the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord asserts that one who surrenders fully unto him is protected from all sins by the grace of the Lord. So, Krishna assures, I will free you from all sinful reactions. You simply surrender to me alone. Since, now Prabhupada explains this, how does it work? Since his name, means the Lord's name, and he himself, the Lord himself, are identical, the holy name of the Lord can protect the devotee from all effects of sins.

name of the Lord can undoubtedly deliver one from disadvantages of lower class, lower caste birth. The Lord here appears to be in a very high and righteous position, because the Lord is involved directly. In the case of somebody who takes to the devotional service, directly, the Lord is involved. Therefore, the devotee, even if he is a neophyte, a beginner, still, the Lord takes charge of those on the pure devotional path, and never puts in fact, devotional path and what is the pure devotional path simply surrender to a pure devotee spiritual master and follow the instructions that's all that is required and one becomes free from all disadvantages due to low birth the heart is cleansed completely of all sinful reactions of course one should stop sinning not that one continues to sin and says I will chant Hare Krishna and become cleansed of all sinful reactions no it doesn't work like that so it is said here the Lord's unlimited power is extended on and on by the unlimited expansion of the devotees and incarnations and thus every devotee of the Lord and incarnations also can be equally surcharged the potency of the Lord Lord only expands and that expansion of the Lord is equally potent the Lord powerful as the Lord but still in addition to that one should actually understand that devotees who are who are empowered by the Lord they are as powerful as the Lord in the matter of cleansing those who come in contact with them and receive the holy name from them not only the Lord but his pure devotees who are empowered by him also can act

**Key Quote:** "So this verse is a very important verse spoken by Suta Goswami."
**Summary:** The speaker recites and translates verse 20 from the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, highlighting the unlimited nature of God and the unique position of Lakshmi Devi.

So the 20th verse: Etavatalam Nanu Suchitena Gunair Asamya Natishamaya Nishaya Nasya Hitvetaraan Prarthayato Vibhuter Yasyangri Renum Jushate Nabhip Soho. The meaning of this verse is: It is now ascertained that he, the personality of Godhead, is unlimited and there is none equal to him. Consequently, no one can speak of him adequately. Great demigods cannot obtain the favor of the goddess of fortune even by prayers, but this very goddess renders service unto the Lord although he is unwilling to have such service. So this verse is a very important verse spoken by Suta Goswami.

**Key Quote:** "Only one personality in the entire cosmic manifestation that is the supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna alone is unlimited."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the unlimited nature of Krishna, stating that He is the only unlimited personality in the cosmic manifestation and that His qualities, forms, and opulences are also unlimited.

What is the position of the personality of Godhead? Sri Krishna. In the previous verse, there was a description about the personality of Godhead who is unlimited in potency and transcendental by all the attributes. He is called Ananta, the unlimited personality, supreme personality. So that unlimited, now he is justifying. Suta Goswami is justifying because nobody is equal to him and nobody else can be unlimited. Only one personality in the entire cosmic manifestation, that is the supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna alone is unlimited and no one can speak of him adequately. Any amount of description cannot exhaust the different transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord. So he has unlimited qualities. He has unlimited forms. He has unlimited opulences. Everything about him is unlimited.

**Key Quote:** "So he accepts the service of Lakshmi Devi he accepts the service of his innumerable devotees pure devotees simply for blessing them for giving them his blessings for showing his mercy upon them."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while demigods seek the favor of Lakshmi Devi, she serves Krishna, who is complete and doesn't need her service, but accepts it to bless His devotees.

And one specific point here in this verse is that when compared to the goddess of fortune, Lakshmi Devi, and what is the position of the goddess of fortune, Lakshmi Devi? Great demigods, they seek her favors, but they are unable to obtain it even by offering so many prayers, but that goddess of fortune, Lakshmi Devi, she herself renders service to the unlimited Supreme Lord, Anantha, the personality of Godhead, Krishna. But Krishna's position is not that he is in need of Lakshmi Devi's service. He is full and himself is complete and he is not in need of Lakshmi Devi's service. Even then, it is his kindness that even though he doesn't require the service, it is for benefiting the servitor that the Lord agrees to accept that service. So he accepts the service of Lakshmi Devi, he accepts the service of his innumerable devotees, pure devotees, simply for blessing them, for giving them his blessings, for showing his mercy upon them, and one should not wrongly think it is some kind of necessity that Krishna has to be served and he is dependent on the service of his devotees, no, never.

**Key Quote:** "Shruti is the original Vedas which have been received in oral translation."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain the difference between Shruti and Smriti literature, defining Shruti as the original Vedas received through oral tradition.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this point by clearly referencing the Shruti literature. Now what is the difference between Shruti literature and Smriti literature? Two kinds of Vedic literatures: Shruti and Smriti. Shruti is the original Vedas which have been received in oral translation of the Shruti literature which have been received in oral translation of the Shruti literature which have been received in oral translation of the Shruti literature which have been received in oral translation of the Shruti literature two kinds of Vedic literature one or the other Shruti is Arjuna'sľhooハ Shoppa within Brahma's heart. So at that time, there was nobody other than the Supreme Lord and Brahma. Brahma is the first created being. So then from Brahma it is coming down in parampara from Brahma to his sons and disciples, from them to their disciples and successors. That is the oral tradition. It's called Shruti. It is received by hearing. It is received by hearing from the predecessor. So it is coming down in human society and since the beginning of creation, that's called Shruti literature, the original Vedas. What we say, the original Vedas. You would have heard of these terms: Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva Veda. So these four Vedas are basically the original Vedic knowledge and these Vedas have many subdivisions also, many varieties of details are there of this original Vedas: Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishads, like that. It there is it's very vast body of knowledge. Then there are other kind of Vedic literature called Shruti.

**Key Quote:** "Shruti literature is the compilation of the same vedic message by the saintly persons by the great devotees by witches sages or by dead火根 for explaining the Vedic message to a particular audience to explain in an easily understandable way"
**Summary:** The speaker defines Smriti literature as compilations of Vedic messages by saintly persons, making the knowledge more accessible, and gives examples like Puranas and Itihasas.

literature. What is Shruti literature? Shruti literature is the compilation of the same vedic message by the saintly persons, by the great devotees, by witches sages or by dead火根 for explaining the Vedic message to a particular audience, to explain in an easily understandable way because the Vedic message in the original Vedas is very difficult to understand for most people, for common people. So it has been simplified and presented in different ways to disseminate the same knowledge, the same message without any change, without any interpretation, the original message as it is explained in simple way. So what is this Smriti literature? The examples of Smriti literature are all other literature other than the Vedas like the Puranas, the Itihasas, the Sutras, the Upaveda's, the Vedangas and the various commentaries, the various explanations given by realized Acharyas etc. So Bhagavatam is in the category of Smriti literature, that is one of the Puranas, but it is not a creation of some person which is independent of the Vedic message. It is exactly the same message of the vedas, the original Vedas which is there in the Bhagavatam, but the way it is written and it is not something which gets stolen in some way, there is no reason for that. The speciality of Bhagavatam is it is directly and easily understandable. The Vedas sometimes speak in a very very indirect way whereas the Puranas are directly describing the Vedic message.

**Key Quote:** "The personality of Godhead or the Parameshwara Parabrahman according to the Shrutis has nothing to do so in the Shrutis it is said natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natat samascha abhyadikas cha dhrushyate parashya"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Shruti literature to emphasize that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Parameshwara Parabrahman, has nothing to do, meaning He is independent and self-sufficient.

So Srila Prabhupada in the opening of the purport itself he says the personality of Godhead or the Parameshwara Parabrahman according to the Shrutis has nothing to do. So in the Shrutis it is said natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natat samascha abhyadikas cha dhrushyate parashya shaktir vividhaiva shuyate svabhaviki jnanam karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam cha vidyate natasya karyam karanam. So this is one of the verses in the Upanishads. Now it's not easy to understand this, but what it means is that the Supreme absolute truth, the Supreme personality of Godhead known as Parameshwara Parabrahman to distinguish him from other controllers, subordinate controllers, lower level controllers, controllers, Ishwaras. So he is Parameshwara. Nobody else can be called Parameshwara. Only Krishna, the Supreme Personality got it. It's called Parameshwara and Parabrahman because Brahman means the sometimes refers to the living entities. But Krishna is Parabrahman. Atma refers to the living entities sometimes, but Paramatma refers only to the Supreme Personality of God in this way. The Supreme Lord is distinguished from everyone else in so many ways. So that Supreme Personality of God and according to the Shruti literature that Prabhupada is quoting here, it is described the Shruti literature is nothing to do.

### Krishna's independence, devotee's need
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/BFiVtLo-C4s?t=781
**Verse References:** BG 3.22
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "His position is unique in that he has unlimited potencies and Is every action is carried out systematically in his natural perfect ways"
**Summary:** The speaker reinforces the idea that Krishna has no equal or superior and is full in Himself, unlike beings in the material world who are always in need, concluding the lecture.

Same thing is told in the Bhagavad Gita also: Name Parthasthi Kartabhyam Trishulokeshu Kinchana. See Bhagavad Gita also the same Message. Bhagavad Gita is also part of Mahabharata, which is Smriti literature, Itihasa. But even that Bhagavad Gita, what is spoken by Krishna and documented or recorded by Vyasa Deva also contains the same Esoteric message that the absolute supreme absolute truth, the Supreme Personality of God has nothing to do. What does it mean he has nothing to do? So that is explained by Prabhupada further. He has no equal. That means everybody else has got duties. Everybody else has got Something to do. By their very constitution Prabhupada further says nor does anyone excel him. Nobody can excel him. He is no equal. He has no superior. Everybody is subordinate to him. But His position is unique in that he has unlimited potencies and Is every action is carried out systematically in his natural perfect ways: parashya-shaktir-vividhayi-vashuyate-svabhavikī natural jñāna-balak-kriyāca automatically, systematically, very nicely carried out by his different energies. Thus the supreme personality of God is full in himself and he has nothing to accept from anyone else including the great demigods like Brahma. So nobody need to offer him service for the sake of Krishna being in need of something, no. In this world we accept service from others because we are in need. Everybody is in need. Nobody is complete by themselves, nobody is complete, but the supreme lord is full in himself and he is completely full so he is not in need, we are in need. So that difference always eternally exists. So I will stop here, thank you very much.

### Krishna's Supremacy, Impersonal vs. Personal Absolute Truth

**Key Quote:** "The absolute truth is impersonal localized and personal and the person is the ultimate source of even the localized feature and the impersonal feature."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam and explains that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the source of both the impersonal and localized aspects of the Absolute Truth, clarifying misconceptions from the Vedas.

In this session we will discuss from the 21st verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Athapiyatpada Nakhaava Srishtam Jagadvirincho Pahruta Arganambhaha Sesham Punati Anyatamau Mukundarth Konamaloke Bhagavadpadarthaha. The meaning of this verse is, who can be worthy of the name of the Supreme Lord but the personality of God as Sri Krishna? Brahmaji collected the water emanating from the nails of his feet in order to award it to Lord Shiva as a worshipful welcome. This very water, the Ganges, is purifying the whole universe including Lord Shiva. This is yet another word spoken by Suta Goswami to assert that Krishna is the supreme personality recorded because in the Shruti literature, in the original Vedas, there is so much description of the supreme absolute truth in impersonal feature, especially the Upanishads, that people think according to the Shrutis the absolute truth is impersonal only, but that is completely wrong. The absolute truth is impersonal, localized, and personal, and the person is the ultimate source of even the localized feature and the impersonal feature.

### Brahma's Role, Ganga's Origin, Krishna's Lotus Feet

**Key Quote:** "Brahma what is he doing he is collecting the water emanating from the nails of Krishna's lotus feet and why is he doing that in all of our need to Lord Shiva as a worshipful welcome"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Brahma's role in creation and his worship of Krishna, focusing on the origin of the Ganges River from the nails of Krishna's lotus feet and its significance.

This is clearly described in many places in the Shruti and the Smriti. So therefore, who among the many, many, many, many personalities in this entire creation, in the cosmic manifestation, can be called as a supreme Lord? It is only Krishna, Shri Krishna, the personality of God is Shri Krishna only in the Shruti… can be called as the Supreme Lord. Nobody else can be called like that. Why so? That is being substantiated by Suta Goswami by saying one specific feature which illustrates this point very, very clearly. Now consider Brahma, he is the topmost personality in this entire created universe. He is the first created being and he does the secondary creation after the initial work of creating the different elements and making all arrangements for creation and creation and creation and creation and creation and creation and creation and creation, the living entities to take birth in this material world. The Supreme Lord has entrusted the secondary creation to Brahma. So Brahma is so powerful, he creates all the other creatures in the entire universe in millions of planets, each planet having millions of living beings. All of them are given their body at the beginning of creation by Brahma. Of course, Brahma is assisted by his many assistants, but nevertheless it begins with Brahma among the created beings. So but above Brahma is the Supreme Lord himself and Brahma has been given the power by the Supreme Lord that Brahma, what is he doing? He is collecting the water emanating from the nails of Krishna's lotus feet and why is he doing that? In all of our need to Lord Shiva as a worshipful welcome. There is a description in the fifth canto, bother in other places in the scriptures that the origin of the river Ganga flows through all the planets in the whole universe, one river that flows in all the planets. From the topmost Brahmaloka up to Pathada. Every planet, this river flows. What is this river actually consisting of? It consists of the water that emanated from the nails of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna.

### Ganga's Purifying Power, Vamana Deva, Lord Shiva's Purification

**Verse References:** SB 1.18.21
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Shiva considers that that water of the river Ganges is purifying him."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the origin of the Ganga from the causal ocean when Vamana Deva pierced the universe, its purifying power, and how even Lord Shiva considers it purifying.

In his incarnations, Vamana Deva, the Supreme Lord Krishna, he extended his foot to pierce the covering of the universe and because each universe is like a shell floating in the Garbhodaka ocean, I am sorry, floating in the Karanodaka ocean, causal ocean. So that water of the causal ocean, which is completely spiritual water, that leaked from the hole that was formed in this universal covering. And while that water came through the hole, how was that hole made? When Vamana Deva extended his foot to pierce the coverings of the universe. And the water came, it washed the feet of the Supreme Lord. And that water is very respectfully received by Brahma. It's very precious. Why? Because it was spiritual, but it contains the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. And that is very, very, very, very precious for all of us. That has got all the potencies of the Supreme Lord. So Brahma received it and he awarded it to Lord Shiva. Shiva received this water of the Ganga river on this earth planet. And that's another description given in the fifth canto of the Bhagavatam. What was the need for Shiva to receive that water and how Shiva received it? That's a detailed account given in the fifth canto. Some other time I may... explain that. But Shiva considers that that water of the river Ganges is purifying him. Shiva is a pure personality, but even he considers the sacred water of the Ganga river as to be very, very potent and powerfully purifying. He says it purifies even me. What to speak of others? So therefore it is said this water of the Ganga is purifying the whole universe including Lord Shiva.

### Ganga's Purifying Power, Sinful Reactions, One God

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Simply by taking a bath in the Ganga, their sinful reactions are completely nullified, are destroyed."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the purifying power of the Ganga and then addresses the common misconception of many gods in Vedic literature, clarifying that there is only one Supreme God.

So that is the actual position of the Supreme Lord in comparison with such great personalities as Brahma, Shiva and Mother Ganga herself. Ganga flows through the whole universe, all the planets, because wherever any living being has got any sinful reactions, simply by taking a bath in the Ganga, their sinful reactions are completely nullified, are destroyed. So who can have that potency? How did Mother Ganga, the river Ganga get that potency? Because Ganga is emanating from the nails of the lotus feet of Krishna. Therefore Ganga has become very, very powerful and got the purifying effect. Ganga can purify any sinner completely, simply if he takes bath once in the river Ganga. So how powerful the water of the river Ganga is, you can understand by this description. So in the purport Shila Prabhupada says, the conception of many gods in the Vedic literature by the ignorant is completely wrong. People think, no? In the Vedic tradition or in the Hindu religion, they say there are many gods. Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Ganesha, Kartikeya, Durga and Lakshmi and this thing. So many, 33 crore devatas are there. 33 crore devatas are there. So they think that actually God is not one, but God is one. God is not one, but God is many in all these forms of the devatas. Actually, the scriptures clearly describe the Lord is one without a second. Ekameva Advitiya. Means he is only one, Supreme God. And Advitiya, there is no one who is a second god equal to him or like him. Nobody is there. Nobody is there.

### Krishna's Expansions, Mystic Powers, Krishna's Supremacy

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is always the supreme, always the greatest, always the most powerful."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Krishna, though one, expands into many forms and possesses unlimited mystic powers, emphasizing his supremacy over all other beings and devatas.

Now, even though the Lord is one without a second, he is only one personality, one person. Still, because he is an unlimited person, he expands himself in many ways. What is the meaning of expanding? He is present, let us say, as Krishna. He is also present as Balarama. He is also present as Ramachandra. He is also present as Vamanadeva. He is also present as Varaha. He is also present as Narasimha. He is also present as Narayana. He is also present as Sankarsana. Now, all these forms of personality is one person. He is one person. Now, this is difficult to understand for limited beings like us. What is our experience? One person means one form. That's all. That's our experience. We don't know of any one person, one soul, multiple bodies or multiple forms. We don't know. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is described those who acquire this mystic power, yogic power, yoga siddhi. One of the siddhis is, one of the powers they acquire is when they practice Ashtanga Yoga and advance, then they can expand themselves in nine forms. A yogi who has got yogic power by properly practicing the Ashtanga Yoga system can acquire different kinds of powers. Eight major siddhis, eight minor siddhis and four auxiliary siddhis. Totally 20 siddhis. But Krishna also has mystic powers. He has unlimited mystic powers. See the difference? And Krishna's mystic powers are such that Krishna also expands. Yogi can also expand. But yogi can expand maximum nine forms. And Krishna expands into unlimited, he expands into unlimited forms. So, Krishna is always the supreme, always the greatest, always the most powerful. And everyone else has got a very, very, very, very tiny fraction of the qualities of Krishna, of the powers of Krishna, of the beauty of Krishna, of the wealth of Krishna, of the... every aspect of Krishna. Everyone else has got a very, very tiny portion of it. And that tiny portion of whatever they possess is awarded by Krishna. So, never consider Krishna to be like another devata, like another god. No. Krishna is the only, one and only supreme lord. He is unlimited. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The lecture begins with invocations and then introduces and translates Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.22, focusing on the concept of self-control and renunciation through attachment to Krishna.

Om Agyanati Miran Dhasya Gyananj Nishalakaya Chakshurun Militam Yena Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha Nama Om Vishnu Padaya Krishna Preshtaya Bhutale Shri Mate Bhakti Vedanta Swamin Nithinamine Namaste Saraswate Deve Gauravani Pracharine Nirvishesha Shunyavadi Pashchatyade Shatharine Jaya Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nityananda Shri Advaita Ganadhara Shri Vasadi Gauravakta Vrinda Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udeerayet.

The meaning of this verse is self-control. Self-control means the person who is attached to the Supreme Lord, Sri Krishna, can all of a sudden give up the world of material attachment, including the gross body and subtle mind, and go away to attain the highest perfection of the renounced order of life, by which non-violence and renunciation are consequential.

**Key Quote:** "Even if somebody has got a lot of yogic power, even if somebody has done a lot of tapasya, even if somebody has got a lot of knowledge... if they don't have attachment for Krishna, it is not possible to nullify all material attachments."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the unique position of Krishna and how attachment to Him is essential for true renunciation and detachment from material existence, surpassing the effects of yogic power, austerity, or knowledge alone.

And Upashama. So, further, the glorification of Krishna, Krishna's unique position and unique qualities of Krishna, that if we see some wonderful qualities in great renunciants, like Maharaj Parikshit, for example, this verse has got a reference to Maharaj Parikshit and such great personalities. Those who are self-controlled and they have reached the perfection of renunciation, they are called Paramahamsas. They will be explained by Prabhupada in the purport. I am just mentioning it with respect to the translation itself. So such Paramahamsas, they are able to completely give up all of a sudden their gross body and subtle mind, and go away to achieve the perfection of existence. And how is it possible for them to give up such attachments, material attachments, which are very deep-rooted and very complex, and very difficult to give up? It is because of their attachment to Krishna. So even if somebody has got a lot of yogic power, even if somebody has done a lot of tapasya, even if somebody has got a lot of knowledge, has got so many other good qualities, if they don't have attachment for Krishna, it is not possible to nullify all material attachments, to go away from this material existence to Krishna, to attain lotus feet of Krishna.

### self-control, sense enjoyment, minimum requirements

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Self-controlled means not indulging in sense enjoyment more than is necessary. The minimum requirements of the senses are to be fulfilled. Bare minimum."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Prabhupada's definition of self-control as minimizing sense enjoyment to only fulfill the bare minimum requirements of the body, even for transcendentalists, distinguishing it from complete cessation of sense activity.

Not possible. So Prabhupada explains this in the purport, in a very nice way. He says, only the self-controlled can gradually be attached to the Supreme Personality. So even among different categories of transcendentalists, if any transcendentalist, a spiritual aspirant, is not self-controlled, then he cannot get attachment, cannot develop attachment for Krishna. Now what does self-controlled mean? Prabhupada says, self-controlled means not indulging in sense enjoyment more than is necessary. The minimum requirements of the senses are to be fulfilled. Bare minimum. And such people are called self-controlled. Self-controlled does not mean I completely give up all the necessities of the body or the senses. No. Then there is no possibility of existing even. Existence itself becomes impossible. So, as long as the material body is there, the minimum requirements of the body has to be provided, even by a transcendentalist, even by a spiritualist. So, such personalities who have perfected their life by practicing, giving the requirements of the senses, providing the requirement of the senses to the minimum extent possible, in a matter of eating or sleeping or defending, they provide the body with the minimum requirements. And such people, they never indulge in sense enjoyment more than minimum required.

**Key Quote:** "Dry philosophical speculation is a subtle sense enjoyment of the mind."
**Summary:** This segment warns against unrestricted sense enjoyment and introduces the concept of 'dry philosophical speculation' as a subtle form of sense enjoyment that can hinder spiritual progress.

So, those who are not self-controlled, Prabhupada says, are given over to sense enjoyment without restriction. Unrestricted sense enjoyment. Or as much as they feel like enjoying, they enjoy. But that is not the way of progressing in spiritual life to attain perfection. And Prabhupada makes a very important point here. Dry philosophical speculation is a subtle sense enjoyment of the mind. So, some people gross senses they have controlled. They are only providing the minimum required. But as far as philosophical speculation, what is philosophical speculation? Speculation means keep on guessing, keep on imagining, keep on calculating, keep on deducing. So, that sort of speculation, which is in order to understand what is the absolute truth, in order to know God, or in order to theorize what is the cause of this material existence, or what is the ultimate goal of life, or who is God, such philosophical speculation is also a subtle sense enjoyment of the mind.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between gross and subtle sense enjoyments, explaining how both lead to material bondage and ignorance, perpetuating the cycle of birth and death and preventing liberation.

There are two kinds of enjoyments any person can have in this world. One type of enjoyment is the gross enjoyment of the external senses: the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the sense of touch. Then there is one more sense within. It's called the mind. Now satisfying the mind, demands of the mind. Just like somebody likes to read a nice story, fiction, novel. Now what kind of pleasure does it give the person? It's a subtle pleasure of the mind, or the pleasure of the mind. Pleasure of the intelligence. When somebody uses their intelligence for solving some problem in physics or mathematics, that gives them great joy. And what is that kind of joy or pleasure? It's a pleasure, internal pleasure, subtle pleasure. So this sort of subtle sense enjoyment is also a cause for material bondage. So Prabhupada says, sense enjoyment, whether gross or subtle, leads one to the path of darkness. That means one remains in ignorance. Who am I? What is this world? What is the goal of life? They remain in ignorance. And as a result of remaining ignorance, they keep taking repeated birth and death, birth and death, birth and death, birth and death, and consequently they suffer in material existence, the fundamental miseries, janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhī-duḥkha-dośānudarshana. Those who are self-controlled can make progress on the path of liberation

**Key Quote:** "The Vedas therefore enjoin that one should not go on the path of darkness, but should make a progress and march towards the path of light or liberation."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of self-control for liberation and contrasts the 'path of darkness' (material existence) with the 'path of light' (liberation), cautioning against artificially suppressing the senses as a means of achieving self-control.

from the conditional life of material existence. So, to make progress beyond this material world, to get out of material existence, is possible for those who practice self-control. The Vedas therefore enjoin that one should not go on the path of darkness, but should make a progress and march towards the path of light or liberation. Tamaso ma jyotir gama. Tamas means the darkness of this material existence. And jyoti means the light, path of light or liberation, out of this material world, out of material existence. Don't remain in darkness, progress towards the light. Self-control is actually a journey achieved not by artificially stopping the senses from material enjoyment. Some people, some philosophers, some transcendentalists, they say if you want to control the senses, stop all sense activity. That means if you are seeing with the eyes, stop seeing. If you are hearing with the ears, stop hearing. Like that. Negate all sense activities.

### bhakti yoga, purified senses, transcendental service

**Key Quote:** "The real method of self-control is, to become attached to the Supreme Lord by engaging one's pure senses in his transcendental service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that true self-control is achieved through bhakti yoga, by purifying the senses and engaging them in the transcendental service of the Lord, rather than forcibly suppressing them.

Now, this is not the way of self-control. It may seem like with great amount of austerity, if somebody stops the sense activities, they may expect that they will become completely self-controlled. But the real method of self-control is to become attached to the Supreme Lord by engaging one's pure senses in his transcendental service. sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena-nirmalam hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeṣa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate. Bhakti means serving the master of the senses, the Supreme Lord, through one's purified senses by becoming free from all material designations. Our senses become designated due to different material activities. But to free oneself from material designations and thereby purify the senses, and engage the purified senses in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Krishna, that is actually the way of becoming self-controlled. Senses have to be given proper engagement, not simply forcibly stop them. Don't do that. Don't forcibly stop the senses. So Prabhupād says, when the senses become purified, and that is the process of bhakti, sādhanā bhakti, senses become purified. When you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, ceto darpana mārjanam, your senses, your mind becomes purified. Mārjanam, become cleansed of material dirt, material contamination that goes away as you keep on chanting, as you keep on performing bhakti, activities of devotional service. So these purified senses are always engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. The only engagement for the purified senses is serving Kṛṣṇa, doing devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. This perfectional stage of sense enjoyment

is called bhakti yoga. So those who are attached to bhakti yoga, they can easily give up all material attachments, any time, all of a sudden if they are called. Like what happens? It seems like suddenly death comes. So it's never sudden, but we don't know exactly when we are going to die. We know we are going to die, but we don't know when. So whenever that happens, it is like all of a sudden death comes. But a devotee who has practiced devotional service and is factually situated in practice of bhakti, such a devotee can suddenly give up all material attachments and progress and go back to Godhead. That is what is explained here. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 23rd verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining that devotees describe the Lord to the extent of their realization, acknowledging the Lord's unlimited nature.

In this session, we are discussing three verses: the 23rd, 24th, and 25th verses of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, first we will discuss the 23rd verse. The meaning of this verse is that, O Rishis, now Suta Goswami is addressing the sages who are as powerfully pure as the sun. He is glorifying the assembled sages, that you are all very, very powerfully pure as the sun. To you I am speaking. So, I shall try to describe to you the transcendental pastimes of Vishnu as far as my knowledge is concerned. And he gives an example: as the birds fly in the sky as far as their capacity allows, so do the learned beings, so do the learned devotees describe the Lord as far as their realization allows. Now, this has got a connection with one of the previous verses where it was described the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna has got unlimited qualities, has got unlimited attributes. Therefore, it's called Ananta. So, nobody can completely describe the Lord. Nobody can fully describe the Lord. So, the Lord is the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Garuda can fly from one planet to another planet."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of birds flying to different heights to illustrate the varying capacities of devotees to understand and describe the Lord, highlighting Garuda's exceptional ability to traverse the universe.

So, does it mean because we can't describe the Lord fully, so we don't describe him at all? No. Learned devotees always describe the Lord as much as their realization allows. As much as they know, they describe. Just like the birds, they fly in the sky. Not all birds can fly as high as another bird. So, some birds can fly at low heights. Some birds can fly even higher. And Garuda, what is the capacity of Garuda to fly? Garuda can fly from one planet to another planet. And there are other birds also that can fly. But Garuda can fly piercing the coverings of the universe, can go outside this material universe, into the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky, Garuda can fly through the spiritual sky and go to the spiritual planet of Vaikuntha Loka because Garuda is the carrier of the Supreme Lord Vishnu. And Vishnu travels. He travels within this universe from one planet to another planet. The descriptions are there in the Bhagavatam. Sometimes he travels from the material world to the spiritual world, sometimes he travels in the spiritual world to the material world, like that. So Garuda, because he's the carrier of the Lord and the Lord needs to go wherever, so Garuda is able

to fly the maximum, you can fly everywhere. So, like that, the example is given: just like birds can actually fly as high as their capacity permits them, similarly, the learned devotees also describe the Lord as much as their realization allows. So then, the next two verses are actually giving us the prelude to the Bhagavatam. What happens by which Shukadeva, sorry, Pariksit Maharaj met Shukadeva? So, what happened? So, he is bringing a description here. 24th and 25th verses together, they are given: ekadha dhanurudhyamya vicharan vrgyamvane vrgaan anugata shantaha shuditas trishito vrsham janashayam achakshanah praviveshatam ashramam dadarshamunim asinam shantam milita no chanam. Beautiful verses. The meaning of these two verses is: once upon a time, Maharaj Pariksit, while engaged in hunting in the forest with bow and arrows, became extremely fatigued, hungry, and thirsty while following the stags. While searching for a reservoir of water, he entered the hermitage of the well-known Shamika Rishi and saw the sage

sitting silently with closed eyes. So, Prabhupada says in the purport that the circumstances under which Srimad Bhagavatam was spoken for the benefit of all concerned is now being explained, beginning with the words, "once upon a time." This happened sometime in history. Therefore, Suta Goswami, he also is talking of the past because he heard the Bhagavatam from Shukadeva Goswami, when Shukadeva Goswami spoke to Pariksit Maharaj. So, that's what Goswami said: once upon a time in the past, what happened? Maharaj Pariksit was engaged in hunting in the forest. Hunting was permitted for Kshatriyas to keep up their skills for fighting, for protecting the weaker sections, for challenging the enemies, for controlling the miscreants, etc. So, while he went hunting, he became extremely fatigued, hungry, and thirsty while hunting. And he started searching for water, a reservoir of water, and he couldn't find it. And while doing so, because he was very thirsty and fatigued and hungry, he entered the hermitage of the well-known Shamika Rishi, a great saint. I will be described later on who is the Shamika Rishi in more detail. For now, he entered the hermitage of the well-known Shamika Rishi and saw the sage sitting with closed eyes. Shamika Rishi was sitting in meditation. His eyes were closed. And in such a situation, Pariksit Maharaj entered that ashram of the Shamika Rishi. Now in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says something very, very significant. He says how this is the prelude. Prabhupada says, the Supreme Lord is so kind to his pure devotees that in proper time he calls such devotees up to him and thus creates an auspicious circumstance for the devotee.

**Key Quote:** "When the Lord feels that his pure devotee who has gone to the material world from his abode has to come back if he wants the devotee to come back earlier than a normal time frame then he creates some awkward situation so that the devotee will leave everything and go to the Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of devotees returning to Godhead and how the Lord sometimes creates difficult situations to encourage renunciation and detachment from worldly affairs.

Devotees come to the material world for the purpose of the Lord. The pure devotees who belong to the spiritual world, they come to this material world. But after they finish the purpose for which they have come to this world, they generally are going back to Godhead because that's where they belong. So, they come from Krishna's personal abode and they go back. Just like the Lord comes from his personal abode and he goes back, same way pure devotees also, the associates of the Lord also do the same thing. So, when the Lord feels that his pure devotee who has gone to the material world from his abode has to come back, if he wants the devotee to come back earlier than a normal time frame, then he creates some awkward situation so that the devotee will leave everything and go to the Lord. So, a similar thing happened to Pariksit Maharaj. So, because the Lord wanted Pariksit to come back to him, therefore the Lord arranged that Pariksit Maharaj become extremely fatigued, hungry, and thirsty. So, Prabhupada says was a pure devotee and there is no reason for him to become extremely fatigued, hungry, and thirsty. Why? Because a devotee of the Lord never becomes perturbed by such bodily demands. A devotee is fully self-controlled as his personal bodily demands are concerned, he is completely controlled. So, there is no need for him to feel extremely inconvenienced by thirst, hunger, and fatigue. But by the desire of the Lord, even such a devotee, pure devotee like Pariksit Maharaj can become apparently fatigued and thirsty just to create a situation favorable for its renunciation of worldly activities. Crispy is ruling as the Emperor of the world and we have heard about his

encountering the personality of Kali and how he dealt with Kali in a very just manner. He punished and rewarded Kali, but he was ruling perfectly. But when Krishna wants his devotee back, he wants a devotee first of all to renounce all worldly connections. So, you know, to create a favorable situation for renouncing of Pariksit Maharaj, what did Krishna do? Krishna made him feel extreme inconvenience due to thirst, fatigue, and hunger. So, Srila Prabhupada says one has to give up all attachment for worldly relations before one is able to go back to Godhead. So, this is one of the qualifications. Anybody wants to go back to Godhead has to give up all the attachments for worldly relationships. And when a devotee is too much absorbed in worldly affairs, the Lord creates a situation to cause indifference to devotees. Pariksit Maharaj, he was busy doing his duty of ruling the world and in the course of doing his duty, he was engaged in so many different material activities in the kingdom. But the Lord wants him to give up all those material attachments. So, what the Lord do? He created a situation. The Supreme Lord never forgets his pure devotee even though that pure devotee may be engaged in so-called worldly affairs. Sometimes he creates an awkward situation and the devotee becomes obliged to renounce all worldly

affairs. It happened to Pariksit. Now, the devotee can understand by the signal of the Lord that it is the Lord's intervention in the life of the devotee, but others, the common people, they take it to be unfavorable, frustrating. They don't understand the hand of the Lord is there in the life of Pariksit, that he became very thirsty and fatigued. They don't think that the Lord has created a situation or they don't understand the point. Maharaj Pariksit was to become the medium for the revelation of Shreemad Bhagavatam by Lord Sri Krishna. As the example is given, Pariksit's grandfather Arjuna was a medium for Bhagavad Gita to be spoken by Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. So, Pariksit's grandfather is Arjuna. Arjuna actually was a devotee of Krishna and contemporary of Krishna also. But for Krishna to speak Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, Krishna created some situation. That Prabhupada explains. Had Arjuna not been taken up with an illusion of family affection by the will of the Lord, the Bhagavad Gita would not have been spoken by the Lord himself for the good of all concerned. Actually, Arjuna was not in need of Bhagavad Gita. Nor is he a Bhagavad Gita. He is a pure devotee. But Krishna created a situation where Arjuna became afflicted by lamentation. And in that state of lamentation, he inquired from Krishna and Krishna spoke the Bhagavad Gita.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that Pariksit Maharaj's fatigue and thirst were instrumental in creating the circumstances for Shukadeva Goswami to speak the Bhagavatam, thus benefiting all.

Through Arjuna, Krishna wanted to enlighten the whole world. Similarly, had Pariksit Maharaj not been fatigued, hungry, and thirsty, then Bhagavatam would not have been spoken by Shukadev Goswami. So therefore, in order that Shukadev Goswami speak Bhagavatam for our benefit through Pariksit Maharaj, Pariksit Maharaj apparently became extremely hungry, thirsty, and fatigued. And it led to some more events because of which he gave up his kingdom and sat and heard the Bhagavad Gita. So that is the prelude for the Bhagavatam in these two verses. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

The entire Srimad Bhagavatam. That's a wonderful position of the Bhagavatam, the Srimad Bhagavatam. Just like the conversation between Arjuna and Krishna led to the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, the scripture called Bhagavad Gita. Similarly, inquiries by Pariksit Maharaj and the answers by Shukadeva Goswami constitute the entire Srimad Bhagavatam.

**Summary:** The speaker reads the translation of the 26th verse, emphasizing its technical description of the state of consciousness of Samika Rishi during meditation.

The 26th verse. The meaning of this verse is the muni's sense organs, breath, mind, and intelligence were all restrained from material action. They were all restrained from physical activity, and he was situated in a trance apart from the three, wakefulness, dream, and unconsciousness, having achieved a transcendental position qualitatively equal with the supreme absolute. So, this is a very, very technical description of the state of consciousness. In the passage of the books, there is an analysis of Samika Rishi. He was externally, he appeared to be just sitting and doing some meditation. That's all. The way King Pariksit saw him in his ashram, in Samika Muni's ashram, he saw Samika Rishi sitting in meditation. But what was the real state of consciousness that is very precisely described in this verse?

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the meaning of the verse, explaining how the senses, breath, mind, and intelligence are restrained from material activities in spiritual practice.

So, just before I go to the purport, let me just re-read the translation with sufficient pause for each of the different portions of this wonderful translation. The muni's sense organs, indriya, prathiruddha indriya. Prathiruddha means it was restrained. From what? Restrained from what? From material engagement, from material contact, from material activities. It is just like our eyes or ears. Generally, what are they engaged in? In seeing material objects. In hearing different kinds of material sounds. So, they are engaged materially. That's a normal condition of any person in this world. But, those who are interested in spiritual life, in spiritual experience, they want to stop this material engagement and completely engage. Engage spiritually. So, the spiritual engagement is possible provided, first of all, we practice controlling, restraining these senses and gradually elevate these senses to the spiritual position, spiritual platform. So, first of all, the muni's sense organs. First of all, the muni's sense organs are restrained. Prathiruddha indriya. Then, prana, his breath. Then, manaha, the mind. Buddhi, the intelligence. So, the sense organs we know. Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and sense of touch. And breathing. We know the breathing. We breathe in and breathe out. That actually activates our prana, the vital air that is circulating in this body and keeping this body alive and in a working condition. The breath. And then the mind. And intelligence. Manasa and Buddhi.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of trance and introduces the three states of consciousness: wakefulness, dream, and unconsciousness, focusing on the wakeful state.

All these four were restrained from material activities, and he was situated in a trance. What is this trance? Param. Praptam. He was situated in a trance. Param Praptam. No, that's not Param Praptam. Situated in a trance is sthanatrayat. He was situated in a state apart from the three states of consciousness. Now, in the scriptures it is explained, as spirit soul, we are conscious beings. We have got consciousness or awareness. Just like now I am aware of all my surroundings through my eyes, through my ears I hear some sounds which are produced outside. I see objects with these eyes. I am conscious. I am in a room. I am speaking to an audience who are hearing me. Explain the Bhagavatam words, etc. So this is the state of consciousness called wakeful state.

**Key Quote:** "These five senses are the gateway for our interaction with the outside world."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the dream state, explaining how the external interaction is stopped and the five senses are shut off.

Then there is the dream state. Swapna avastha. When we go to sleep at night, then you are aware, every night we experience this, but we become unaware of our external surroundings. Our external surroundings we become unaware. We don't know what is happening outside. So that is the state when we go to sleep and we are fast asleep. So then in that sleeping state, there are two different states of consciousness. One is called a dream state and other is called an unconscious state. Dream state is called in Sanskrit, swapna avastha. Swapna means dream. So in English it is translated by Prabhupada, swapna avastha is translated as dream state. So wakeful state, dream state and a third state, which is the other state in the sleeping condition, unconscious state. Sometimes it is called also as a deep sleep state. That means there is no awareness of a dream, but there is no awareness externally also. This dream state is where we enter a subtle world. That means the spirit soul inside this body is experiencing a certain state of awareness. State of awareness. So wakeful state is the state where basically the mind is interacting through the five senses with everything outside. And the dream state is where the external interaction is stopped because we go to sleep. Normally it is with closed eyes. And then not only we have closed our eyes, but we have also lost our touch or awareness of the external world. And basically the five senses. These five senses are the gateway for our interaction with the outside world. Is it not? So that is cut off when you go to sleep. And then in the sleeping something more happens. Not just merely closing the eyes or shutting the ears or shutting the breathing. No. Shutting the sense of smelling. Not breathing. Sense of smelling. Breathing goes on even when you are asleep. The sense of smelling is shut off kind of. So these five senses are shut off when we sleep.

**Key Quote:** "That dream world is a subtle world."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe the dream state as a subtle world experienced through the mind, and introduces the unconscious state.

When we are in the dreaming state, we are aware or conscious of a dream world. We enter a dream world. That dream world is a subtle world. Subtle world means there are no gross objects. There are no objects for the five senses. It is just the mind which is active and is through the mind. Through the mind we perceive a subtle world. And in that subtle world so many things happen. Just like after waking up from sleep, sometimes we remember while I was sleeping I experienced a dream or I witnessed a dream. I had a dream. Most people can relate with this. Of course you should remember, you should understand that always we don't remember the dream that we experience when we wake up. We don't always remember. Sometimes we remember. But it's a fact that every night when we go to sleep then we get into a dream state and we also experience a we are unconscious with some time. Sometimes we are dreaming and sometimes we are unconscious. Both are there. For everyone.

**Key Quote:** "But subtle experience is there, that is there in the dream state"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of not remembering all incidents in the wakeful state to explain why we don't always remember our dreams, emphasizing the subtle experience in the dream state.

But we don't always remember the dream. Sometimes we remember. Just like to give you an example if I ask you ten days back in your wakeful state can you tell me at this time exactly what happened? Now it is 7.40 pm so exactly ten days back 7.40 pm what were you doing? Immediately you will not be able to recall. Even if you try to recall by going back ten days what was the day of the week? I should have been doing this. I must have been in this place. You try to build up the facts and then you try to still recollect anything significant happened you may try to extrapolate or build it up but you can't exactly remember that this particular thing happened unless it was something very very very significant something very unusual something very very different from the normal happening in our day to day life. So like that all dreams we don't remember. Similarly all just like all incidents in the wakeful state we don't remember. Similarly all dreams we don't remember. So dreaming is definitely there every time we go to sleep but all dreams we don't remember. Extraordinary dreams supposing one particular night you had a very bad dream or a very good dream good and bad in relative terms of course dream is a dream that's all grossly nothing is happening neither anything in your external world is getting disturbed but subtle experience is there that is there in the dream state.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Apart from these three, there is a fourth state consciousness... a state of trance also called samadhi also called the transcendental state of awareness"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of four states of consciousness: wakeful, dreaming, unconscious, and transcendental, focusing on the fourth state of trance or samadhi.

In this session, we continue to discuss from the 26th verse of the 18th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. This is part two of the discussion on the 26th verse. The previous session also we discussed the same verse. We continue discussing. I was explaining in the previous session the three states of consciousness. The three states of consciousness, out of the four totally, we can be, as a living being, spirit soul, we can have four states of consciousness. Consciousness means awareness. So I can be conscious in the wakeful state, like the present state all of us are now. You are awake and you are conscious of everything external. And you have to some extent some internal awareness also, just like your breathing. You are conscious in this state. You have an inner moment of the air inside your canal, et cetera. So, that is wakeful state, normal state when you are awake. And then up the sleeping state, there are two different states of consciousness in the sleeping state: the dreaming and the unconscious state. This I explained in the previous session. And apart from these three, there is a fourth state of consciousness, the dream state of consciousness, which is above the three states, that is what is described here.

### spiritual awareness, material reality, yoga

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In the wakeful state, the dreaming state and the unconscious state... you are not aware about yourself as a spirit soul, you are not aware of any other spiritual reality."
**Summary:** The lecture elaborates on the limitations of the first three states of consciousness, emphasizing the lack of spiritual awareness and how yoga can help one attain the fourth state.

A state of trance, also called samadhi, also called the transcendental state of awareness. You are not just aware of the gross world, you are not just aware of the subtle world inside, or you are not just unconscious of the two, but you are conscious of yourself as the spirit soul and anything further beyond the awareness of yourself as spirit, something more, the spiritual dimension of reality, which is otherwise totally kind of unknown. In the wakeful state, the dreaming state, and the unconscious state, that's called Jagrata Avastha, Swapna Avastha, and Sushupti Avastha, you are not aware about yourself as a spirit soul, you are not aware of any other spiritual reality. What are the other spiritual realities apart from yourself? Every person, every living being is a spirit soul. But when you see the person, you just see the body. At the most, you may recognize the person's state of mind. He is happy, he is sad, or he appears to be lost in some thought, etc., etc., like that. So, or if the person is sleeping, you know he is sleeping. So, he doesn't respond to what is happening in the outside world. So, the person is either in dreaming state or unconscious state. But you are not... You are not aware of something called as a spiritual state of consciousness or awareness, that you do not know. We know only from the scriptures. So, by practice of yoga, one can actually restrain the sense organs, the breathing, the mind, and the intelligence.

**Key Quote:** "And this is possible only for human beings... And it is the state where you are spiritually aware."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that spiritual awareness is unique to humans and discusses how the Supreme Lord is always in a transcendental state, while conditioned souls are trapped in lower states of consciousness due to material contact.

And situate oneself in the fourth state of consciousness, the highest state of consciousness. And this is possible only for human beings. And it is the state where you are spiritually aware. You are spiritually aware. So, the Muni, Shamika Rishi, was in his spiritual state of consciousness. And in that state, what happens? He had achieved a transcendental position qualitatively equal with the Supreme Absolute. The Lord, the Supreme Lord Krishna, Supreme Absolute Truth, is always in the transcendental state of awareness or consciousness, always, eternally. He is always in that state. We, when we are in the material world, when we are in material contact, when we are materially conditioned, when we got this material body and we got material desires and we are interacting with material sense objects, material... Yeah. material objects, then we are in the three lower states of consciousness. That's only for us, conditioned souls, living entities in this material world. It's not for living entities in the spiritual world. It is not for the Supreme Lord, because that is inconsequential spiritually, spiritually it is not important. What are the happenings in this material world, in terms of material interactions,

**Key Quote:** "Similarly, from the spiritual perspective, whatever happens in the material condition is actually not affecting the spiritual reality or the spiritual position."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of a dream, the speaker illustrates how material experiences do not affect spiritual reality and that the material condition is spiritually inactive.

that's not of any consequence spiritually. It's just like when you are dreaming, you are experiencing the dream in your sleep, but externally is anything happening, what you are seeing in the dream? No. Nothing is happening. Hmm. The dream, you may either be happy or you may be sad. You may win some money or you may lose something else. But when you wake up, you say, oh, it is just a dream. So there is no loss, there is no gain. As far as your wakeful state is concerned, in the dream, whatever happens, there is neither any loss nor any gain. So that... Similarly. Similarly, from the spiritual perspective, whatever happens in the material condition is actually not affecting the spiritual reality or the spiritual position. So we can say this material condition, whether somebody is awake or sleeping, the material condition itself is like spiritually inactive. Hmm. Spiritually ignorant, spiritually unaware, spiritually not conscious, not spiritually conscious. You can say materially conscious only. Hmm. So the Muni had achieved a transcendental position in the same level as the Supreme Lord. Hmm.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The transcendental position is attained by three processes... The process of Jnana... the process of yoga... the most approved process of bhakti yoga"
**Summary:** The lecture introduces three processes for achieving the transcendental state: Jnana (theoretical knowledge), Ashtanga Yoga (physiological and psychological manipulation), and Bhakti Yoga (devotional service).

Now, in the Sthapotshrita, Prabhupada explains, it appears that the Muni in whose hermitage the king entered was in yogic trance. It's called yogic trance. Through practice of yoga, he had achieved this trance. Hmm. The transcendental position is attained by three processes. There are three recognized processes for achieving this transcendental state of consciousness. What are the three processes? The process of Jnana. The first process is called Jnana, called the process of jnana or theoretical knowledge of transcendence by study of the Vedic literature, by discussions, by deep study of the Vedic literature describing this particular state of transcendental state of existence. Or the second process is a process of yoga. Yoga here refers to ashtanga yoga, specifically refers to ashtanga yoga or factual realization of trance by manipulation of the physiological and psychological functions of the body. Physiological condition as a function of the body is called ashtanga yoga. Or the function is all the external sense organs, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, etc. All those manipulate means restrain them from material activity and psychological function of the body is thinking, feeling, willing in terms of the use of the mind and the intelligence. So restrain the mind and intelligence from all kinds of material thoughts, material feelings, and material willing, the urge to do something material, restrain that the mind and the intelligence. And by doing so, one is able to actually rise above the three states of consciousness to the fourth state of trance, to the avastha. That's called turiya, means actually literally means the fourth state. The fourth state is the transcendental state of consciousness. And the third process for achieving this trance is the most approved process of bhakti yoga. And what is bhakti yoga? Bhakti yoga means engagement of senses in the devotional service of the Lord, which he came or she cases even a book, the Richard now Prabhupada explains that further.

**Key Quote:** "This verse says the working senses are superior to dull matter working senses and the mind is higher than the senses mind is above the senses and the intelligence is still higher than the mind and the soul is higher than the intelligence."
**Summary:** Referencing the Bhagavad Gita, the speaker explains the hierarchy of perception from dull matter to the soul and how the influence of material qualities causes forgetfulness of our true spiritual identity.

Now Prabhupada explains that further. In the Bhagavad Gita also we have information of the gradual development of perception matter to a living entity the Bhagavad Gita verses indriyani paranyahu indriyebhyaparamanah manasastu paraabuddhi yo buddhe paratastu saha this towards the end of the third chapter this verse in the Bhagavad Gita describes this 42nd verse of the third chapter. So. This verse says the working senses are superior to dull matter working senses and the mind is higher than the senses mind is above the senses and the intelligence is still higher than the mind and the soul is higher than the intelligence. There is a hierarchy. There is a hierarchy. The soul below the soul is the intelligence below the intelligence is the mind below the mind is the senses and below the senses is dull matter. So Prabhupada explains that our material mind and body developed from the living entity the soul and being influenced by the three qualities of matter we forget our real identity three qualities of matter that sattva guna, rajo guna, tamo guna. The influence of the material body. The influence of the material energy on the consciousness we forget we are spirit soul we are not aware we forget ourselves we forget Krishna we forget all spiritual reality.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The jnana process theoretically speculates about the reality of the soul... but bhakti yoga factually engages the spirit soul in activities"
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts the speculative nature of the Jnana process with the practical engagement of the senses in devotional service (Bhakti Yoga), using chanting Hare Krishna as an example.

The jnana process theoretically speculates about the reality of the soul. Jnana process, they keep on trying to eliminate all material varieties, all material things, or material experiences, or material awareness. They try to negate that it's not spirit, it's not spiritual, this is not spiritual, that's not spiritual, etc. And then what is if spirit soul is not this, not that, not this, not that, what it is? They speculate, they try to eliminate all the negatives and thereby try to postulate or theorize. Therefore it is a theory. It is a theory. It is a theory. They are theoretically arriving at the reality of the soul, but bhakti yoga factually engages the spirit soul in activities. Bhakti yoga is not speculation, it is actual engagement of the senses in the devotional service of Krishna, just like chanting Hare Krishna, you actually vibrate your tongue and produce the sound Hare Krishna Hare Krishna and you hear the sound Krishna through your ears and you do so by by engaging a sense of touch in counting on japa beads so engaging the senses the sense of speaking the sense of hearing and the sense of touch three senses you engage in a definite activity called chanting japa and that is a spiritual activity so engaging the spirit soul in activities spiritual activities that is a bhakti yoga process.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So this way you transcend the matter to perceive the senses the senses you transcend to subtle mind and mind to the intelligence and intelligence to ultimately realize the soul"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to transcend matter by becoming aware of the limitations of the senses, using examples like mirages and the perceived size of the sun, ultimately leading to realization of the soul.

The perception of matter is transient is still subtler states of the senses. Just like normally when we see something we just aware of that object we are seeing we're not conscious that my eyes I am seeing the object and through my sense of understanding or knowing I am perceiving that object to be something so we are not aware of that when we become aware of the whole process of seeing just like if somebody is looking at a distance in a desert when they are walking they see at a distance there is a body of water that may not be a body of water because when they approach that there is no body of water it appears like at a distance of some 50 feet there is a body of water but when they cross 50 feet while walking there is no body of water it looked like there was a body of water that's called a mirage it's a optical vision optical illusion so that optical illusion when they become aware of that then they become aware of the defectiveness or the limitation of this sense of seeing like the Sun when it is rising you look in the horizon if you need to see the Sun it will appear a disc this big that's all that's all it will appear this big a disc but is the Sun that big no it's an optical illusion so this way you transcend the matter to perceive the senses the senses you transcend to subtle mind and mind to the intelligence and intelligence to ultimately realize the soul so this is the process and the Muni was sitting in that particular state of trance so I'll stop here thank you very much Hare

In this session, we will be discussing two words, the 27th and the 28th verses of the 18th chapter of the first canto. So, the 27th verse to begin this session: Vipra Kirna Jatachannam Rauravena Jinenacha Vishushyat Talur Udakam Tathabhutam Ayachata. The meaning of this verse is: The sage in meditation was covered by the skin of a stanchion, and long compressed hair was scattered all over him. The king, whose palate was dry from thirst, asked him for water. So, you just try to picturize what's happening. Pariksit Maharaj has gone hunting, and he became very tired, thirsty, and hungry, and he started searching for water, and he came across this muni's ashram, Shastra of the sage in meditation, Shamika Rishi's ashram.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the description of the sage and the king's request for water, highlighting the unexpected nature of the event.

He entered inside and saw the sage is sitting in meditation. And the way King Pariksit saw the muni is being described here further, that the sage, that is Shamika Rishi, who was sitting in meditation, was covered by skin of a stanchion. These rishis, they don't wear regular clothes because they are in the forest. So, the sage was sitting in meditation, so they cover themselves with some skin of an animal or a bark of a tree, something easily available, and that need not be changed, that need not be washed, just because they sit for meditation for a very long time. So, they have no time to maintain all those things, and long compressed hair was scattered all over him. There's no time to trim the hair or shave, etc., so the compressed hair is everywhere over his body. And this King Parikshit, he was very, very thirsty, so thirsty that his palate or his tongue was completely dry, and he entered and he asked for water because he was very, very thirsty. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "The king being thirsty asked the sage for water," something very natural and very simple, "that such a great devotee and King asked for water from a sage absorbed in trance was certainly providential," something unexpected, something not expected from a

Obviously, you don't expect the Rishi will be, when he's sitting in meditation and deeply absorbed in meditation, you don't expect him to be conscious that some guest has come or somebody has come asking for water, you wouldn't expect that. So, and in spite of that, because the king was very, very, very thirsty, he's desperately looking for water, so he just asked, just asked. So, it is something which is extraordinary because Prabhupada says here, "otherwise there was no chance of such a unique happening." It is very, very unique. This is an incident arranged by the Supreme Lord for Bhagavatam to be spoken by Shukadev Goswami on enquiry of Parikshit Maharaj. All these descriptions are events leading to that extraordinary meeting of Parikshit and Shukadev Goswami, leading to the Srimad Bhagavatam being spoken. So, Maharaj Parikshit just placed an awkward position so that gradually Srimad Bhagavatam

This is describing King Parikshit. What was his reaction? He thought, "I have come to his Muni's ashram, and the Muni is not angry. He is not responding. He is indifferent to my having come here. He is not offering a seat or place to sit down, no welcome, and no water and no sweet talk." So, he considered that "I have been neglected. Very basic etiquette is not being followed.

**Key Quote:** "The law of reception in the courts of the Vedic principles state that even if an enemy is received at home he must be received with all respects."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic principles of hospitality, emphasizing that even enemies should be treated with respect, and provides the example of Jarasandha's reception of Krishna, Arjuna, and Bhima.

and he became angry. So, Prabhupada explains in the purport, so the background for this verse being this, this description by Suta Goswami. The law of reception in the courts of the Vedic principles state that even if an enemy is received at home, he must be received with all respects. This is the Vedic culture. Whoever it is, when they come to your house, enemy or friend, a stranger or a known person, you have to receive that person with all respect. This is very important. After you get to the be all respects, the visitor should not be given a chance to understand that he has come into the house of an enemy if he happens to be an enemy. And proper gives an example here, when Lord Krishna, accompanied by Arjuna and Bhima, approached Jarasandha in Magadha, the respectable enemies were given a royal reception by King Jarasandha. Enemy means enemy camp. Jarasandha belongs to the camp of the Asuras headed by Kamsa, and Krishna, Arjuna, Bhima, the Pandavas, they belong to the camp of devotees and Supreme Lord, obviously. So, when Krishna, Arjuna, and Bhima approached Jarasandha, they were in disguise. So, even though they were in disguise, when Jarasandha tried to inquire, "Who are you?" because he could not recognize their external features, they disguised themselves. So, then when they reveal their identity, still Jarasandha understood, "These are my enemies," but still he received them with a royal reception. This is very cultural. And it is also told in the Mahabharata, the guest enemy, namely Bhima, was to fight with Jarasandha, that the purpose for which Krishna, Bhima, and Arjuna had gone, and yet they were given a grand reception. So, at night they used to sit down together as friends and guests, and in the daytime they used to fight, risking life and death. That was a law of reception in their fighting and

**Summary:** The speaker continues to elaborate on Vedic etiquette, explaining that even the poorest person can offer basic hospitality, and highlights King Parikshit's astonishment at being denied even basic courtesies.

one of them will be defeated and killed. Still, that is only due to the daytime the fight is going on, Bhima versus Jarasandha. At night the fight is not concluded at the end of day one, day two, day three, four, for so many days. So, when the fight has not been decided, they at the night they will be like Bhima, Arjuna, and Krishna are guests of Jarasandha. So, they'll be nicely given a place to stay, they'll be given a nice food, nice talk, everything very nice. Now, further Prabhupada says, the Vedic etiquette, the reception law enjoins that a poor man was nothing to offer his guest, very poor, should be good enough to offer a straw mat for sitting, a glass of water for drinking, and some sweet words. So, Prabhupada says, therefore, to receive a guest, either a friend or foe, somebody is an enemy, not an enemy, is a friendly person, there is no expense. It is only a question of good manners. Very culture is the poorest of poor man, when he receives somebody at home, he still offers a good reception simply by offering a straw mat. Straw mat means some straws which are available anywhere, they just woven together and made into a sitting mat. So, straw mat, some water to drink, water is available everywhere, you know, poor man is plenty of water. Earlier there is to live always by a water source, either a river or a nice pond or lake or a nice well, and plenty of water always there is water. So, water even a poorest of poor man can offer, a straw mat he can offer to the guest, he can offer sweet words, "Welcome to my humble abode, please come sit down, accept some water, what can I do for you?" So, sweet words can be offered without any expense. So, it is question of good manners. Now, Prabhupada explains, when Maharaj Pariksit entered the door of Shamika Rishi, he did not expect a royal reception by the Rishi because he knew that saints and Rishis are not material rich persons, they are living in an ashram, they are not material rich persons, they are living in an ashram, they are living in an ashram, they are not material rich persons, they are living in an ashram, some hut, and where can they offer royal reception? Even the king, because King deserves a royal reception, but how can they offer a royal reception? So, Pariksit did not expect a royal reception, but he never expected that a seed of straw, a glass of water, and some sweet words would be denied to him. He was not an ordinary guest, nor was he an enemy of the Rishi, and therefore the cold reception with the Rishi was not an ordinary guest, nor was he an enemy of the Rishi, and therefore the cold reception with the Rishi was not an ordinary guest, nor was he an enemy of the Rishi, and astonished the King greatly. Why am I astonished the King greatly? Why am I being denied even some basic reception? I being denied even some basic reception? I just want some water, that's all, and even just want some water, that's all, and even that water is being denied by this Rishi.

**Key Quote:** "It must be accepted that this situation was ordained by the supreme will of Lord Krishna...the merciful Lord sometimes creates such awkward position for his pure devotees in order to drag the pure devotee towards himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the situation was ordained by the Lord to detach Parikshit from material attachments and draw him closer, and that devotees should accept frustrations as blessings.

That's what thinking of Pariksit Maharaj is. So, going by the etiquette that is expected, the king was right to get angry with the Rishi when he needed a glass of water very badly. So, Papa says in the elecmosis, to become angry in such a grave situation was not unnatural for the king, but this special circumstance here, what is that? Because the King himself was not less than a great saint, he was saintly king, rajarshi. Pariksit was not ordinary king, his becoming angry and taking action were astonishing. Very the muni is sitting in trance, he is engaged in spiritual activities, he is cut off from external sense perception, he is absorbed within completely, and you expect that such a meditating sage, he's going to offer you some reception, he's going to give some water, he's conscious that you have come to his ashram? No. So, why is King Pariksit becoming angry? That is a question that should be raised. So, proper says it must be accepted that this situation was ordained by the supreme will of Lord Krishna. The king was a great devotee of the Lord, and the saint, that is Samika Rishi, was also as good as the king in saintly conduct, but by the will of the Lord, the circumstances are so created that they became ways to the kings becoming unattached to family connection and governmental activities and thus becoming a surrendered soul unto the lotus feet of Lord Krishna. The events led to that, and that we described in the next few verses. The merciful Lord sometimes creates such awkward position for his pure devotees in order to drag the pure devotee towards himself from the mire of material existence. Mire means that entangling situations in this material world. The Lord wants to pull out every one of us, but the pure devotees is particularly conscious, "Come out quickly out of this material existence and come back to me." Outwardly, the situations appear to be frustrating to the devotees, but the devotees of the Lord are always under the protection of the Lord, and in any condition, frustration of success, the Lord is a supreme guide for the devotees. Devotees understand if there is some frustrating situation, they know it is the arrangement of the Lord. Lord has got a higher plan, otherwise the devotees are never put in frustrating situation in inconvenience, they execute the devotional service peacefully, but sometimes in spite of their endeavor to execute devotional service, they put in a situation where is difficulty even for doing devotional service, and that is the Lord has got a higher plan. Devotees therefore accept all conditions of frustration as blessings from the Lord, and that's what happened in the case of Parikshit Maharaj. I'll stop here.

**Key Quote:** "The king's anger and envy directed toward the Brahmana sage were unprecedented being that circumstances had made him hungry and thirsty."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unprecedented nature of a devotee king like Parikshit becoming angry and envious towards a sage, highlighting the rarity of such an event.

The meaning of this 29th verse: O Brahmanas, this is Suta Goswami addressing the sages of Naimisharanya while describing the incidents leading to Parikshit Maharaj becoming angry at the Shamika Rishi. So the king's anger and envy directed toward the Brahmana sage were unprecedented, being that circumstances had made him hungry and thirsty. Unprecedented means such a thing has never happened in the past. A devotee king approaching a Brahmana sage who is absorbed in meditation, expecting that I will get some reception, I will get some water, I will get some relief from my thirst, when he was extremely thirsty and hungry, not getting anything, he became frustrated, he became angry, so this is unprecedented. The Parpochala Prabhupada says, for a king like Maharaj Parikshit to become angry and enraged, envious especially at a sage and Brahmana, was undoubtedly unprecedented. Never has such a thing happened in the past. It is very, very, very rare.

**Key Quote:** "The king knew well that Brahmanas, sages, children, women and old men are always beyond the jurisdiction of punishment."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic cultural context where the king protects citizens, especially Brahmanas, sages, children, women, and old men, who are given special care and are generally exempt from punishment.

It is, as they say, rarest of rare situations, extraordinary situation. The king knew well that Brahmanas, sages, children, women, and old men are always beyond the jurisdiction of punishment. This is again the Vedic culture that a king protects his citizens very nicely, and among the citizens he gives special care and protection to five categories of the citizens. Who are they? First is Brahmanas. And that Brahmanas includes the cows also. Brahmanical culture, Govabrahmanahitayacha. Krishna is described as Govabrahmanahitayacha. He is always very much concerned about the well being of Brahmanas and cows. Brahmanahiya means those who are devotees. Second is Sages. Sages are saintly persons, those who are dedicated for spiritual life, Sanyasis or Rishis or Trans-Elders of any kind, Yogis, etc. So they are also given special protection by the king. They are dedicated completely for spiritual life. A Brahmana is dedicated for the giving the service in the society to the other classes of people, the Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. They always depend on the Brahmanas for getting spiritual guidance, for any spiritual duties, for any rituals to be performed, for any spiritual knowledge, etc.

**Key Quote:** "The third category of protection special protection for citizens is the children."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to elaborate on the king's responsibility to protect vulnerable groups like children, women (especially widows and orphans), and the elderly, even overlooking minor mistakes they might make.

The third category of protection, special protection for citizens, is the children. The children are small so they have to be given extra protection, and women. Women are naturally the weaker section of the society, the men are stronger, so women require special protection. Generally they are protected by their husbands or father or grown up sons, but in case somebody is all alone then the king must be protected, then the king must give special protection for such women who don't have a husband or they are a widow or they are somehow an orphan or they are they are not able to get any protection from any of the elders then the king has to give special protection for such women and old men, very aged and they don't have a guardian, they don't have grown up son or they don't have a guardian who can protect them, so king has to give special protection for such categories of people and not only he gives protection but he also understands if they make a mistake it is pardonable because they are in a special category so they are to be given a concession that they make some small mistake you just don't apply the law for such categories of personalities.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the concept that a king is generally not considered a wrongdoer, even if he makes mistakes, and emphasizes that the situation with Parikshit Maharaj was orchestrated by the Lord.

Similarly, the king, even though he commits a great mistake, is never to be considered a wrong doer. So on one side is Shamika Rishi who is a saintly person, he should never be punished even if he has made a mistake, he has not done a mistake, even if he has done a mistake he is not punishable by the king. Other side is the king, the king can do no wrong, the king can do no wrong. See, even Shamika Rishi should not have become, not Shamika Rishi, in this case the Shamika Rishi's son should not have become angry at the king because king being the protector and the well wisher of all the citizens, if he makes a minor mistake that should be excused by everyone else. So king is never considered a wrong doer. In this case Maharaj Pariksit became angry and envious at the sage due to his thirst and hunger by the will of the lord. So here the will of the lord, the lord is arranging the situation.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Parikshit's unusual behavior was arranged by the Lord, and that the king's actions, though seemingly wrong, were part of a divine plan.

Extraordinary situation for Bhagavatam we spoke. So the king was right to punish his subject for coldly receiving him or neglecting him, but because the culprit was a sage and a brahmana it was unprecedented. Normal person if he does not receive the king properly in order to teach that person a lesson that you should receive people properly he may give him some punishment, but not in the case of this brahmana who is sitting in sage, sitting in meditation. As the lord is never envious of anyone so also the lord's devotee is never envious of anyone. So Maharaj Pariksit is a devotee, he can't be envious at the sage, not out of envy he became angry. The only justification for Maharaj Pariksit's behaviour is that he was, it was ordained by the lord. The lord arranged this Pariksit's unusual behaviour and the brahmana's son Karsing that we will hear later what happened after this.

The 30th verse: Satu Brahma Risher Amse Gatasum Uragam Rusha Minir Dacchan Dhanush Kotya Nidhaya Puram Agatah. The meaning of this 30th verse is, while leaving, the king was not received, he was very thirsty, he didn't get water, he became angry, what did he do? While leaving that place, being so insulted, he was feeling insulted, he picked up a lifeless snake, a dead snake. How did he pick up? With his bow, with his bow because he was, he had come hunting, he was bow and arrows, bow in one hand, so that bow he picked up a dead snake and angrily placed it on the shoulder of the sage and returned to his palace. This is the 30th verse.

**Key Quote:** "Although the king was never accustomed to such silly actions, why should he take so seriously the sage not receiving him under the circumstances?"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Parikshit's action of placing the dead snake was a 'tit for tat' response to feeling insulted, but emphasizes that this behavior was unprecedented for a devotee king dealing with a sage and was ultimately orchestrated by the Lord.

So Prabhupada says that in the purport, the king thus treated the sage tit for tat. You didn't receive me properly so I also want to teach you a lesson that you are neglecting basic etiquette. So he took one dead snake and put it on the shoulder of the sage and said what is this, he is garlanding the snake at the sage. It is a way of, I was insulted so I also insult you that tit for tat. Although the king was never accustomed to such silly actions, why should he take so seriously the sage not receiving him under the circumstances, I have not been given water and I am very thirsty, do not think like that, but a will of the lord. The king while going away found a dead snake in front of him, again the dead snake, it is not that it is so common to find dead snakes everywhere, no. So one dead snake was there, happened to be there nearby and while going away he thought the sage who had coldly received him might be coldly rewarded by being offered a garland of a dead snake, basically I was insulted so I also insult him, take one dead snake which just happened to be lying there and put it on his shoulder and just go away. In the ordinary course of dealing this was not very unnatural, that means it is expected only if somebody is not received they become angry and they react, but in the case of Maharaj Pariksha dealing with a brahmana sage this was certainly unprecedented, never such a thing would have happened in the interaction between a devotee king and a sage who is a brahmana who is situated in trance, who is very very advanced yogi who is absorbed in meditation, cut off from external awareness, it is not expected such a thing would happen, so it so happened by the will of the lord.

**Key Quote:** "So he said let me prepare for quitting this body by becoming Krishna conscious so therefore he surrendered himself as a disciple to Shukadeva Goswami and thus he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of God."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how Maharaj Pariksit prepared for death by surrendering to Shukadeva Goswami and becoming Krishna conscious to understand the position of the Lord.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 3rd verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Utsarijya Sarvata Sangam Vijnata Ajita Samsthitihi Vaya Saker Jahu Shishyo Gangayam Swam Kalevaram. The meaning of this verse is, furthermore, after leaving all his associates, the king surrendered himself as a disciple to the son of Vyasa, Shukadeva Goswami, and thus he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of Godhead. So, R. S. Goswami is narrating the events leading to Maharaj Pariksit being cursed by a Braamana boy. So, before describing the actual incident, it is being described here that Pariksit Maharaj, in his life, is charming in a lot of ways. The world, this situation, this incident means that he is... Maharaj, he heard the curse and he decided to prepare for quitting the body, for death by the bite of the snake bird, even though he could have contracted the curse, because he realized that he has to prepare for death whenever death might come. Death cannot be totally avoided when the material body is there. The body cannot be kept forever, this material body. So, death means we'll quit this material body and spirit soul. So, that Parikshit Maharaj knew very well. So, he said, let me prepare for quitting this body by becoming Krishna conscious. So, therefore, he surrendered himself as a disciple to Shukadeva Goswami, and thus he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of

**Key Quote:** "The personality of God Shri Krishna is known as Ajita or unconquerable and he so in every respect this word Ajita is a name of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of the name 'Ajita' for Krishna, emphasizing that the Lord is unconquerable and cannot be understood through mere accumulation of knowledge.

God. So, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the word Ajita is significant here. The personality of God, Shri Krishna, is known as Ajita, or unconquerable, and he... So, in every respect, this word Ajita is a name of the Supreme Lord. Elsewhere in the Bhagavatam, it is described that the Supreme Lord appeared as Ajita when the churning of the milk ocean was going on, it was about to begin, and in order to favor the Devatas who wanted to produce nectar by churning the milk ocean, he assumed the form of a tortoise, Kurma Rupa or Kurma Avatara, the tortoise incarnation. It was Lord Narayana who appeared first as Ajita. He became the Kurma Avatara, and he supported the Mandara mountain on his back, because the Mandara mountain was used as a churning rod by the Devatas and the Asooras to churn the milk ocean and produce nectar. So, that same name is used here to describe the Supreme Lord. Why? Why is he called Ajita? He is unconquerable in every respect. No one can know his actual position. Why is he called Achitha? No one can know his actual position ever. Why is Ajita used? Because Parikshit Maharaj could understand the actual position of the Lord, whose position cannot be understood by people in general, ordinarily. So, the Supreme Lord is unconquerable. He is unconquerable by knowledge also. So, that means if somebody tries to undergo cultivation of knowledge, accumulating knowledge, getting knowledge more and more and more and more of the absolute truth or about God, simply by acquiring knowledge, any amount of knowledge about God, you cannot understand the actual position of God, not possible.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that understanding the Lord's abode, Goloka Vrindavana, and His paraphernalia requires the grace of a spiritual master and humble surrender, not just scholarship or speculation.

Now, Srila Prabhupada further explains, we have heard about his dharma, the Supreme Lord's eternal abode, Goloka Vrindavana. But there are many scholars who interpret this abode in different ways. What is this abode of the Lord, Goloka Vrindavana? Different scholars say, explain it differently. But by the grace of a spiritual master like Shukadev Goswami, unto whom the king gave himself up as a most humble disciple, one is able to understand the actual position of the Lord, his eternal abode, Goloka Vrindavana, and his transcendental paraphernalia in that dharma or abode. These things are very, very confidential knowledge. Such highly confidential knowledge cannot be realized simply by scholarship, simply by speculation, using one's intelligence, you cannot realize this knowledge. It is possible only by the way Parikshit Maharaj surrendered unto the Acharya, Shukadev Goswami. And by the grace of Shukadev Goswami, with the mercy of Shukadev Goswami, being a surrendered disciple, he was able to realize all this knowledge. Knowing the transcendental position of the Lord and the transcendental method by which one can approach the transcendental dharma,

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the understanding of Goloka Vrindavana with the impersonal view of the Mayavadis and the materialistic perspective, highlighting their ignorance of spiritual reality.

the king was confident about his ultimate destination. So this Goloka Vrindavana is not some impersonal situation as the Mayavadis think. The Mayavadis, their philosophy is, God is formless, and if there is any description of kingdom of God, that is also formless. And everything about the Absolute Truth is ultimately without any variegatedness, without any name, without any personality, without any place, without any situation, nothing. So, it is basically some concoction of these Mayavadi philosophers or scholars, what is, what is the kingdom of God, or who is God, or what is the meaning in descriptions of God's form, paraphernalia, his abode, his associates, his qualities, what is the meaning in those descriptions, the Mayavadis don't have any understanding. And the materialists, they simply mock at all spiritual literature as simply some imaginary stories, imaginary stories or some irrelevant literature. Because for them, this material world and material enjoyment, material enjoyment is all in all. They are totally in the darkness of ignorance

**Summary:** The speaker explains that realizing one's eternal nature and destination in Krishna Loka facilitates detachment from material possessions and relationships, as exemplified by Parikshit Maharaj.

as regards spiritual reality. And by the influence of illusion, the materialists accept this material existence as eternal. So, both the materialists and the transcendentalists who are non-devotees, they do not realize what is the personality of Godhead. They do not realize the spiritual variegatedness in the spiritual realm. They do not know what is the abode of the Lord. They do not know that. But Parikshit Maharaj, when he understood the personality of Godhead, he was able to understand the transcendental position of the Lord and the method by which one can approach that transcendental dharma. And the king was confident about his ultimate destination. That means he fixed his destination as I will go back to Krishna Loka, Krishna Dhamma. And by knowing this, he could leave aside everything material, even his own body without any difficulty of attachment. If you know that you don't belong to this world, you know that you have to quit this body sometime, you know that you as spirit-soul are eternal, then what do you do about all this material paraphernalia, the material body, the material possessions, material relationship, what do you do with all that? So, Parikshit Maharaj clearly knew that he has to leave everything at the time of death. So before death comes, he cut off all attachments

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that detachment from material attachments is possible by understanding the superior energy of the Lord and realizing spiritual variety, which requires the grace of a bona fide spiritual master, not just theoretical knowledge.

to all these various things. That will be described in the second canto, how Parikshit Maharaj, Parikshit Maharaj cut off all attachments. Shukadeva Goswami, the description of the meeting of Parikshit Maharaj and Shukadeva Goswami, in that description, there will be details about how Parikshit Maharaj quit his kingdom, gave up all attachments and came to hear from Shukadeva Goswami in the Krishna Katha, in the form of Bhagavad. In the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated, param drishtva nivartate, one can give up all connection with material attachment when one is able to see the param or the superior quality of things. Prabhupada is explaining how Parikshit was able to give up. From Bhagavad Gita, we understand the quality of the Lord's energy that is superior to the material quality of energy and by the grace of a bona fide spiritual master like Shukadeva Goswami, it is quite possible to know everything of the superior energy of the Lord by which the Lord manifests his eternal name, eternal quality, eternal pastimes, eternal paraphernalia and variegatedness. Unless one thoroughly understands this superior or eternal energy of the Lord, it is not possible to leave the material energy. However, one may theoretically speculate on the true nature of the Absolute Truth. See, there are transcendentalists who are not devotees, but they know ultimately Absolute Truth is spiritual. They know that, but they do not know the nature of the Absolute Truth in terms of the spiritual variegatedness. So, because they do not know of the spiritual variegatedness, they are unable to give up this material variety, the material attachments, they are unable to give up. So, Bhagavad Gita says, param drishtva nivartate, one can give up material attachments or material paraphernalia, material connections, material relationships, if one really knows and one realizes what is spiritual variety, what is spiritual abode, what is spiritual name, what is spiritual form, until one realizes that there is no possibility of giving up any of the material varieties. Simply by theoretical knowledge

you cannot. By the grace of Lord Krishna, Maharaj Pariksit was able to receive the mercy of such a personality as Shukadeva Goswami and thus he was able to know the actual position of the unconquerable Lord. It is very difficult to find the Lord through Vedic literatures, but it is very easy to know the Supreme Lord by the mercy of a liberated devotee like Shukadeva Goswami. There is only way and there is no other way. And Pariksit was fortunate to meet Shukadeva Goswami and learn from him and realize the Supreme Lord by the mercy of Shukadeva Goswami. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the significance of Srimad Bhagavatam, particularly the Rasaleela, and its power to destroy mundane sex desire and establish one in devotional service.

Bhagavatam came into being. So Prabhupada says this book incarnation of the Lord gives much fascinating information on the transcendental pastimes of the Lord like his Rasaleela with the spiritual covered damsels of Bhagavad Gita. The special thing about Bhagavatam is that it gives the details of the incarnation of the activities of the Supreme Lord Krishna, the incarnation of Lord Krishna and particularly those activities which are very very very confidential. The Rasaleela incident is very confidential. So Shreya Prabhupada says this specific pastime of the Lord, this Rasaleela has a special significance. What is significance? Because anyone who properly learns about this particular pastime of the Lord will certainly be dissuaded from mundane sex desire. See if you hear properly about this Leela from the right source then your mundane sex desire is completely destroyed and such a hearer will be placed on the path of sublime devotional service to God. One becomes established in proper devotional service to

Now that is because Arjuna was put in a position where he had to fight against his own cousins due to the frustration by the due to the frustration the Pandavas had to undergo due to the harassment of this Duryodhana and Pandavas. Unnecessary harassment. So then war became essential. They were deprived of their kingdom. But even before fighting the battle, when all peace negotiations failed, Arjuna being a pure devotee, he was considering should I fight this battle and kill my kinsmen simply because we want the kingdom and as a pure devotee he is not interested in having a big knife and big kingdom. No. So Krishna spoke the Bhagavad Gita to actually address the problem of Arjuna. But that was primarily Krishna only who put Arjuna in that situation. Sir Krishna could speak through Arjuna to all of us the Bhagavad Gita. So Brahma says by placing King Pariksit in an awkward position, the incarnation of Sriman Bhagavatam was created by the will of

See the history of Pariksit is when he was in the womb of his mother, one Brahmastra was released by Ashwathama to kill that child in the womb. But Pariksit endured that experience. Endured that extreme heat of the Brahmastra. And if he could endure so much of extreme condition, a little thirst while hunting, why he couldn't endure? That's the argument. The King's distressed condition was certainly unprecedented. The devotees like Maharaj Pariksit are powerful enough to forbear self-distress by the will of the Lord. And they are never disturbed.

### verse 32, power of brahmanas, influence of Kali, deterioration of Vedic culture

**Key Quote:** "But because the age of Kali was seeking an opportunity to spoil the culture to heritage of the four orders of life, the inexperienced boy gave a chance for the age of Kali to enter into the field of Vedic culture."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of verse 32, highlighting the power of the brahmana boy Sringi and how the influence of Kali led to a decline in Vedic culture and the rise of hatred among different social orders.

So the 32nd verse: Tasyaputro Atitejasvi Viharan Balako Arbhakaihi Rajnagam Praapitam Tatam Shrutvata Tredam Abhravit. The meaning of these 32nd verses: This sage had a son who was very powerful, being a Brahmana's son. While he was playing with inexperienced boys, he heard of his father's distress just occasioned by the king. Then and there, the boys started to play with him. Indeed, In the Purport, Shrila Prabhupada says, "Due to Maharaj Pariksit's good government, even a boy of tender age who was playing with other inexperienced boys could become as powerful as a qualified Brahmana. This boy was known as Sringi, and he achieved good training in Brahmacharya by his father. He could be as powerful as a brahmana even at that age. But because the age of Kali was seeking an opportunity to spoil the culture to heritage of the four orders of life, the inexperienced boy gave a chance for the age of Kali to enter into the field of Vedic culture. Hatred of the lower orders of life began from this brahmana boy under the influence of Kali, and thus cultural life began to dwindle day after day."

### degradation of brahmanas, influence of Kali, protection by Pariksit, shelter to Kali

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "We should remember how Kali was trying to enter the kingdom of Pariksit."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how the degradation of brahmanas allows Kali to influence society and recounts the story of how Maharaj Pariksit initially prevented Kali from entering his kingdom but eventually had to give him shelter in specific places.

So this is the explanation given here, how the age of Kali things deteriorate to earth. To a great extent, that the brahmanas who are supposed to be the head of the society, they become degraded and they look down upon the other sections of society. Just like this boy, he wrongly thinks that he is the head of the society. He thought that the king had overstepped his position and he cursed the king. That's going to be explained later in the next few verses. He shouldn't have cursed the king, but he did so. And it happened under the influence of Kali. He was still seeking a chance to enter into the field of Vedic culture, as Shrila Prabhupada says here. The first victim of brahmanical injustice was Maharaj Pariksit. And thus, the protection given by the king against the onslaught of Kali was slackened. We should remember how Kali was trying to enter the kingdom of Pariksit. And Pariksit prevented that by, first of all, threatening to kill Kali because Kali Purusha was harming the coven bull. And when Kali Purusha surrendered, Pariksit Maharaj had to give shelter as a king. So he said, you cannot stay in my kingdom because you are a friend of a religion. And then Kali Purusha was... Kali Purusha was given, still, when he begged for some place, he was given four places, places where meat-eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex are going on. And Kali Purusha could not find any such place in Pariksit's kingdom. So good was Pariksit's rule. And then Kali Purusha was given a fifth place when he couldn't find any place. He was given the place where gold was found, and gold is accumulated without being used for spiritual purposes. And that way Kali Purusha was given some place. But even then, Pariksit protected the citizens by engaging their stored-up wealth, stored-up gold in Sankirtan Yagna.

**Summary:** The speaker suggests using wealth for Sankirtan to protect against Kali's influence, then transitions to discussing verse 33 and Shringi's anger at Maharaj Pariksit's actions.

If we want to protect ourselves against the evil influence of Kali, we should employ 50% of our wealth in propagating Sankirtana. So this way Kali cannot influence the people of this age. So here, the description is that Maharaj Pariksit was the victim of Brahmanical injustice. Wrongly, he was cursed. And that's how the onslaught of Kali was slacked through this injustice. The 33rd words, Aho Adharma Palaanam. Peevnam Balibhujamiva. Swamin Yagam Yad Dasanam. Dvarapanam Shunamiva. The meaning of this 33rd verse is, The Brahmana's son Shungi said, "Oh, just look at the sins of the rulers who, like crows and watchdogs at the door, perpetrate sins against their mothers, contrary to the principles governing servants."

### social order, varnashrama, brahmanas as head, scientific caste system, guna and karma
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/XMxOjTKKrGM?t=472
**Verse References:** BG 4.13
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Brahmanas are considered to be the head and brains of the social body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the social order (varnashrama), comparing it to the parts of the body, with brahmanas as the head and kshatriyas as the arms, and emphasizes that the system is based on quality (guna) and work (karma), referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

Contrary to the principles governing servants. So Shungi, this Brahmana's son, when he heard that his father was insulted by the king, who put a dead snake around his father's neck, so he became very, very angry. And what is he saying? Look at these rulers. What is their position? They are like crows and watchdogs at the door of the Brahmanas. And instead of behaving properly as a servant of the Brahmanas, they are perpetrating sins against their masters. So in the Purport, Shrila Prabhupada says, "The Brahmanas are considered to be the head and brains of the social body, and the kshatriyas are considered to be the arms of the social body. The arms are required to protect the body from all harm, but the arms must act according to the directions of the head and brain." See, the comparison is made, the orders, the spiritual orders, or the social orders: Brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra. They are compared to the four parts of our own body. It's like we have got the head and brain, we got the arms, we have got the belly and we got the legs. So brahmanas are compared to the head and brains of the social body, most important. And kshatriyas are considered to be the arms. So the arms are required to protect the body from all harm, but the arms must act according to the directions of the head and brain. That's how this body is organized. Same way society should be organized like that. That is a natural arrangement made by the supreme order, for it is confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita that four social orders or castes, namely the brahmanas, the kshatriyas, the vaisyas and shudras, are set up according to quality and work done by them. This is the statement of the Bhagavad Gita, the fourth chapter. Krishna explains this. So according to guna and karma it has to be set up. Naturally the son of a brahmana has a good chance to become a brahmana by the direction of his qualified father as the son of a brahmana. The son of a brahmana or a medical practitioner has a very good chance to become a qualified medical practitioner. So the caste system is quite scientific. The son must take advantage of the father's qualification and thus become a brahmana or a medical practitioner and not otherwise. Without being qualified one cannot become a brahmana or a medical practitioner

### qualification vs. birthright, decline of brahmanas, influence of Kali, loss of respect

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "People are claiming to be brahmanas without being trained, without being qualified. And that is where the whole system has become topsy-turvy."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the modern trend of claiming brahminical status based solely on birthright without proper training or qualifications, leading to a decline in respect for brahmanas and a disruption of the social order due to the influence of Kali.

and that is the verdict of all scriptures and social orders. You see, it is true that the son of a brahmana has a good opportunity to learn from his father and become a qualified brahmana. But without the qualification he cannot claim, "I am a brahmana." What is happening nowadays? People are claiming to be brahmanas without being trained, without being qualified. And that is where the whole system has become topsy-turvy. So Prabhupada points out here, "Herein Shrunge, a qualified son of a great brahmana, attained the required brahmanical power both by birth and by training, but he was lacking in culture because he was an inexperienced boy." Even though he was powerful, he was not sufficiently experienced how to utilize the power that he had acquired. By the influence of Kali, the son of a brahmana became puffed up with brahmanical power and thus wrongly compared Maharaj Pariksit to crows and watchdogs. This comparison is completely inappropriate just because this boy, inexperienced boy, was very proud of his brahmanical power. The king is certainly the watchdog of the state in the sense that he keeps vigilant eyes over the border of the state for its protection and defense. But to address him as a watchdog is a sign of a less cultured boy. He is supposed to protect, he is supposed to govern the country or the state or the province, but he cannot be treated like a low-class servant the way Sringi is thinking that the king has become an upstart. Thus the downfall of the brahmanical powers began as they gave importance to birthright without culture. If a brahmana is uncultured then he may wrongly claim to be a brahmana simply by birthright. "I am born in a brahmana family therefore I should be treated as a brahmana." But what about your culture? What about your education? What about your training? What about your qualification? What about your experience? All these are important factors. The downfall of the brahmana caste began in the age of Kali. According to scriptures, 5000 years back Kali Yuga began and that is when unqualified people started claiming this because of birthright that we are brahmanas, we should be respected as brahmanas by all the others. Whereas the others are observing these brahmanas are not qualified and they are wrongly claiming to be brahmanas. So they started losing respect and that is when everything became topsy-turvy. Since brahmanas are the heads of the social order all other orders of society also began to deteriorate.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by discussing how the deterioration of brahmanas leads to the decline of the entire social order, emphasizing the importance of qualified brahmanas providing guidance, and mentions the upcoming discussion of Shringi's father's reaction before ending the lecture.

The brahmana should give directions to the other orders of society which are kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras. But brahmanas themselves are not qualified. How can they give directions, proper directions to the other orders? So the other orders also start deteriorating. This beginning of brahmanical deterioration was highly deplored by the father Shringi as we will find. So what is Shringi's father's reaction that we will see in the next few verses. I will stop here. Thank you. Hare Krishna.

The son of this Rishi was playing with his playmates. He was a young boy, but he was very nicely trained up as a Brahmana. So when the son of this Rishi, Shringi, heard that his father was insulted by the king, the boy Shringi became very angry against this insult by the king of his father, insult of his father. And he decided to curse him, curse the king. So it is described here, his eyes red hot with anger, rosha anger, tamra aksha, like copper. When copper is hot, it is already reddish, but it becomes even more reddish. So red hot, red hot eyes, he was displaying his anger. He touched the water of the river Kaushika while speaking to his playmates. That means he used the power, the Brahmanical power of cursing by using one mantra. And before chanting that mantra, he purified himself. And he discharged the following thunderbolt of words.

**Key Quote:** "the circumstances under which Maharaj Parikshit was cursed were simply childish as it appears from this verse."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada's commentary, highlighting the childishness and impropriety of Shringi's actions and the great harm caused by cursing the king.

Shila Prabhupada says, the circumstances under which Maharaj Parikshit was cursed were simply childish, as it appears from this verse. Small boy. He is not mature. He is not aware of proper etiquette. He doesn't know culture. So Shila Prabhupada says, the circumstances under which Maharaj Parikshit was cursed were childish. Shringi was showing his impudency amongst his playmates who were innocent. Those playmates, they could not make out what was the seriousness involved in either the king's action or the action, the counteraction by this boy, the playmates were small boys. They were just innocent boys. They couldn't judge or gauge or understand anything. So Shila Prabhupada says, any sane man would have prevented him from doing such a great harm to all human society. So this cursing of the king who is the protector of the entire human society because he is the emperor of the world, and cursing him to be killed for a very, very minor mistake is actually improper on the part of this brahmana boy, small boy. By killing a king like Maharaj Parikshit just to make a show of his brahmanical power, the inexperienced son of a brahmana committed a great mistake. This will later on be explained. But here Prabhupada is just mentioning this: Shringi made a very, very, very big mistake. It's called a blunder. He made a blunder. And he was inexperienced son of a brahmana. He did not know what is the proper way to actually react.

**Key Quote:** "Thus the beginning of the misuse of brahmanical power began."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the misuse of brahmanical power, explaining how Shringi's curse marked the beginning of the decline of brahmanas in the Kali Yuga.

This is the justification of this boy in cursing Maharaj Parikshit. The Rajarshi, the great emperor, the protector of all the citizens, the ideal king. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains: Thus the beginning of the misuse of brahmanical power began. Brahmanas are very powerful by training, by culture, by education, by their acquired power due to their austerity, due to their controlling their senses, due to their purity, but such power is never to be misused. It has to be carefully used, properly used. So Prabhupada says the beginning of the misuse of brahmanical power began with this Shringi cursing Maharaj Parikshit, and then what happened gradually the brahmanas in the age of Kali became devoid of both brahmanical powers and culture. So the brahmanas of present day, they don't have the power like this Shringi had or the other brahmanas had in the past. Nowadays, brahmanas don't have that kind of power. Neither they have the brahmanical culture; they don't have brahmanical culture either. So the downfall of the brahmanas began with this misuse of brahmanical power by Shringi.

**Key Quote:** "But factually the brahmana boy himself was so by cursing Parikshit this brahmana boy became the most wretched descendant of the glorious brahmana lineage."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Shringi's curse made him the 'wretched' one, leading to the loss of brahmanical power in his lineage.

The brahmana boy considered Maharaj Parikshit to be Kulaangara, Kulaangara, the wretched of the dynasty. Parikshit is the best of the dynasty of the kings, of the Bharata Vamsha, the best of the kings, and wrongly this brahmana boy Shringi is misunderstanding, total misunderstanding, that Parikshit is wretched of the dynasty. For a small mistake, he is wrongly accusing Parikshit to be the wretched of the dynasty. That means the most fallen, most degraded. But factually, the brahmana boy himself was so; by cursing Parikshit, this brahmana boy became the most wretched descendant of the glorious brahmana brahmana lineage. He himself became a wretched descendant. But he is wrongly accusing Parikshit to be the wretched descendant of the glorious Bharata dynasty or Kuru dynasty. Why is it said here by Srila Prabhupada the brahmana boy himself became the wretched of this lineage? Because only from him did the brahmana caste become powerless. Moment the misuse is there, they lose their power. Then the other descendants of such a brahmana who has lost his brahmanical power will also be powerless.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly in this Kali Yuga the brahmanas are powerless because Sringi misuse that is where the misuse began and that misuse continued for some time till most of the brahmanas became powerless."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a snake with broken fangs to illustrate the powerlessness of brahmanas in Kali Yuga due to the misuse of their power, concluding the lecture.

So the seminal descendants, that is by virtue of taking birth in a particular family, the present day descendants in that brahmanical families have no power, brahmanical power. They don't have brahmanical power. So they have become powerless. And the example is given of becoming powerless like the snake whose poison teeth are broken. If there is a very poisonous snake, it is very dangerous as long as it has got its poison teeth. But if a snake has a very poisonous snake has its poison teeth completely removed, it is possible to remove the poison teeth. Then that snake is not at all having any power. So Srila Prabhupada says the snake is fearful as long as his poison teeth are there. Otherwise, he is fearful only to children. He can make a show that I will be able to bite you, but if he actually bites, nothing happens because his poison teeth are removed. Similarly, in this Kali Yuga, the brahmanas are powerless because Sringi misuse, that is where the misuse began, and that misuse continued for some time till most of the brahmanas became powerless. I will stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "So this was completely impudent on his part to have cursed the king like that."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Sringi cursing King Pariksit and his subsequent regret, highlighting the impudence of the act and the realization of the mistake.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deviim Saraswatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing four verses, 38, 39, 40, and 41, of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Sriman Bhagavatam. The 38th verse. The meaning of this verse is: Thereafter, when the boy returned to the hermitage, he saw a snake on his father's shoulder, and out of his grief, he cried very loudly. This boy has not even seen what has happened. He just heard from his playmates, and immediately his reaction was, "How deadly! How dare the king insult my father! What does he think of himself? Watch my power! Now I am going to teach him a lesson!" And he became extremely angry, immediately cursed the king to die in seven days. So this was completely impudent on his part to have cursed the king like that. So he saw the snake on his father's shoulder after having cursed the king already, and he began to cry very loudly, realizing what a great mistake he had done. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The boy was not happy because he committed a great mistake, and he wanted to be relieved of the burden on his heart by crying." A small boy has made a very, very big mistake. He is realizing his mistake, but it's too late. So after entering the hermitage and seeing his father in that condition, he cried loudly so that he might be relieved, but it was too late. The father regretted the whole incident.

**Key Quote:** "Hearing his son crying, gradually opened his eyes and saw the dead snake around his neck."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Shamika Rishi's reaction to his son's crying, explaining how he gradually came out of his trance and noticed the dead snake around his neck.

39th verse: Sava Angiraso Brahman Shrutva Suta Vilapanam Unmilya Shanakair Netre Drishtva Chamse Mruthoragam. The meaning of this 39th verse: O Brahmanas! Now who is addressing this? O Brahmanas! It is Suta Goswami who is addressing the sages of Naimisharanya while describing this incident. The rishi who was born in the family of Angira Muni. This rishi refers to Shamika Rishi, whose ashram Pariksit had entered, searching for water, and whose son was Sringi. So this rishi, that is Shamika Rishi, was born in the family of Angira Muni, a very glorious dynasty or lineage of Brahmanas. Hearing his son crying, gradually opened his eyes and saw the dead snake around his neck. This rishi was sitting in trance in meditation when Pariksit entered the ashram. So he could not properly, he could not receive the king. He could not offer him any hospitality. He was not conscious of his external surroundings. He was deep in trance. So when he heard the sound of his son crying, loudly crying, he gradually opened his eyes, that is coming out of trance, and he saw the dead snake around his neck. Now what is his reaction?

**Key Quote:** "Actually, there was nothing seriously wrong in Maharaj Pariksit's act. But the foolish son took it very seriously. And being influenced by Kali, he cursed the king."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Shamika Rishi did not take the snake incident seriously and attributes Sringi's curse to the influence of Kali, leading to the downfall of Brahmanical power and societal degradation.

The fortieth verse: Visrjya tamcha papracha vatsakasmadhi rodhisi kenavate apakritam ityuktasa nyavedayat. The meaning of this fortieth verse: He threw the dead snake aside, Visrjya, and asked his son why he was crying, whether anyone had done him any harm. On hearing this, the son explained to him what had happened. So the rishi is hearing from his son, what happened, why are you crying? So the boy explained what all happened. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, the father did not take the dead snake on his neck very seriously. He just threw away the snake and did not take it very seriously. Who has done this? Why has he done this? Why this dead snake around my neck? He never thought anything very seriously wrong had happened by that snake, that snake being placed on his neck. He simply threw it away. Actually, there was nothing seriously wrong in Maharaj Pariksit's act, but the foolish son took it very seriously, and being influenced by Kali, he cursed the king, and thus ended a chapter of happy history. With the cursing of Maharaj Pariksit, the Brahmanical power is lost because of misuse. And then with the downfall of the Brahmanas, gradually all the other sections of the society will fall down, and thus the whole society becomes degraded, the human society. And it is definitely the influence of Kali. This is the beginning of Kali Yuga. So the influence of Kali. Kali means irreligion personified.

**Key Quote:** "always the punishment for a mistake should be in proportion to the degree of the mistake that is committed."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of proportionate punishment, highlighting that the curse on King Pariksit was a severe punishment for a minor offense.

Adharma bandhu. So Kali is meant for spreading irreligion among the people of this Kali Yuga. The forty-first words: nishamya shaptam atad arham narendram sa brahmano na atmajam abhyanandat aho bata amho mahad adhyate krutham alpi yasi droha urur dhamo dhritah. The meaning of this forty-first verse: The father heard from his son that the king had been cursed, although he should never have been condemned, for he was the best amongst all human beings. When Shamika Rishi heard from his son that the king was cursed, he understood that just for a very minor mistake, the king was condemned to death. This is one important point to note, that always the punishment for a mistake should be in proportion to the degree of the mistake that is committed. That means a severe punishment for very big blunders and small punishment for minor mistakes. There has to be some consideration like this always that is there in punishing somebody. The Rishi did not congratulate his son, but on the contrary began to repent, saying, "Alas, what a great sinful act was performed by my son. He was awarded heavy punishment for an insignificant offense." He refers to the king. The king was awarded heavy punishment for an insignificant offense. Death sentence or death punishment, punishment by being condemned to die by snake bite, is a very, very, very, very heavy punishment. And that too, who is being punished like that? The emperor of the world, who is the Rajarishi, who is the protector of all the citizens, who was able to keep away such a king, such a righteous, glorious, wonderful, full of wonderful qualities, such a king is being condemned to death. It's a heavy punishment.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Vedic concept of the king as a representative of God, emphasizing that a righteous king should not be condemned for his actions and is trained to be a Rajarishi.

So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, the king is the best of all human beings. He is the representative of God, and he is never to be condemned for any of his actions. So king means he is meant to rule over the citizens unless he himself is the best of all human beings. He cannot really rule over the citizens. So he himself is qualified, exceptionally qualified. And not only that, in the Vedic culture, he is the representative of God, because God is the real controller of everyone. The supreme lord, Krishna, he is the supreme controller. He is the supreme controller, but he has his representatives, and particularly in human society, he has the king as his representative. So such a personality is never to be condemned for any of his actions. In other words, the king can do no wrong. This is the Vedic injunction. The king is never to be condemned. The king is never to be considered as acting wrongly, if he is acting as the representative of God and he is ruling according to the

**Key Quote:** "even if there is something wrong with the king, he is never to be condemned."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to discuss the role of the king, explaining that even if a king makes a mistake, he should not be condemned, and reiterates that the punishment should be proportionate to the offense.

Now here is an example given by Srila Prabhupada. The king may order hanging of a culprit's son of a Brahmana, but he does not become sinful for killing a Brahmana. Shastras say Brahmana should never be killed, but the king, in exceptional cases, when the son of a Brahmana misbehaves or deserves to be punished by capital punishment, then the king can give that punishment to somebody who is deserving such a punishment. And in that case, the king does not incur the sin for killing a Brahmana. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, even if there is something wrong with the king, he is never to be condemned. So what to speak of a good and pious king like Maharaj Pariksit? So the king is trained to become a Rajarshi, and a Rajarshi or a great saint, he is never to be condemned the way Shringi treated this great Maharaj Pariksit. So the instruction of the Vedas is, the king is called Narendra or Naradeva, and he is the best amongst the human beings. So he should not be condemned like this. For a minor mistake, he may be given some very minor punishment, but never such a grave punishment or a severe punishment for a minor mistake. That is completely wrong.

Nottama Shloka Vartanam Jushatam Tath Kathamritam Syat Sambhramo Antakalepi Smaratam Tath Padambhujam. The meaning of this verse is: This was so because those who have dedicated their lives to the transcendental topics of the personality of Godhead, of whom the Vedic hymns sing, and who are constantly engaged in remembering the lotus feet of the Lord, do not run the risk of having misconceptions even at the last moment of their lives.

**Summary:** The speaker connects verse 4 to the previous verse, emphasizing dedication to transcendental topics and constant remembrance of the Lord's lotus feet as key characteristics of devotees who avoid misconceptions.

So, this verse has got a reference to the previous verse because the verse says, "This was so because..." What was so? That Parikshit Maharaj surrendered himself unto Shri Lashukadeva Goswami and therefore he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of Godhead. So, the fourth verse that today we are discussing now has got relevance to this point made in the third verse, that he was able to understand the actual position of the personality of Godhead because the nature of a person who has dedicated his life to the transcendental topics of the personality of Godhead, and such people also are constantly engaged in remembering the lotus feet of the Lord. Two characteristics: First one is their lives are dedicated to the transcendental topics of the personality of Godhead. They live their life based on the scriptures which glorify the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees. And they also constantly think of the lotus feet of the Lord, Supreme Lord. Such devotees, they do not have the risk of having misconceptions at the end of their lives.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, highlighting that remembering Krishna at the end of life leads to attaining the Lord's transcendental abode and eternal blissful life.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains what is this risk that somebody may have. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, the highest perfection of life is attained by remembering the transcendental nature of the Lord at the last moment of one's life. We are spiritual beings. The Supreme Lord is completely a spiritual personality. We belong to the Supreme Lord's personal abode. So, in this human form of life, we are meant to cultivate Krishna Consciousness to be able to remember the Supreme Lord at the end of our life. Ante Narayanas Pratihi. Antakale Chamameva Svaranmuktva Kalevaram. Both the Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad Gita describe this. At the end of life, to successfully terminate this life, one has to remember Krishna at the last moment. And that is the highest perfection because simply by remembering Krishna alone at the end of one's life, one is able to attain immediately the transcendental abode of the Supreme Lord, never to take birth again in this miserable material world. And having gone there, what do they do? They live eternal life full of bliss and knowledge in the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being engaged in His loving devotional service very naturally.

**Key Quote:** "You have to learn what is this transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord Krishna by hearing from a liberated soul like Shukadev Goswami."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of learning about the Lord's transcendental nature from a liberated soul in disciplic succession to ensure remembrance at the time of death.

So Srila Prabhupada further explains, this perfection of life is made possible by one who has learned the actual transcendental nature of the Lord from the Vedic hymns sung by a liberated soul like Shukadev Goswami or someone in that line of disciplic succession. So how do you actually ensure that you'll be able to remember the Supreme Lord at the end of your life? So for that, you have to learn what is this transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord Krishna by hearing from a liberated soul like Shukadev Goswami or someone in the parampara from Shukadev Goswami who is also a liberated soul. Now, if somebody simply hears this type of Krishna Katha, Bhagavad Katha from some mental speculator, Srila Prabhupada says there's no use. You have to hear from an actual self-realized soul and the hearing process is also directed that one has to properly understand the transcendental nature of Krishna by service and submission. One should be surrendered to the spiritual master and one should render service to the spiritual master. Then the spiritual master reveals the secret, the truth, the most confidential knowledge about the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna. And everything becomes transparently clear, very, very clear. So, by such clear understanding, by realization, one is able to live transcendentally even before death comes. One's life is life dedicated to the Supreme Lord. And such a transcendental living continues till the end of life. And, Srila Prabhupada says, by scientific adaptation, one is able to remember the Lord even at the time of death.

**Key Quote:** "Actually, it is the grace of the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees, the spiritual masters. That is the real secret."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the difficulty of remembering the Lord at death due to bodily derangement, emphasizing the grace of the Lord and spiritual master as essential for success, exemplified by Parikshit Maharaj.

What happens at the time of death? Why is it difficult to remember normally for an ordinary person? That is because at the time of death, the power of remembrance is slackened due to derangement of bodily membranes. Something happens in this body when the time of death comes. We have to leave the body. The bodily functions are going to completely stop working. So, at that moment, last moment, it's not easy, it's not natural to remember the Supreme Lord. For a common man, it is very difficult to remember things as they are at the time of death. But by the grace of the Lord and His bona fide devotees, the spiritual masters, one can get this opportunity without difficulty. So, what really works? Actually, it is the grace of the Supreme Lord and His pure devotees, the spiritual masters. That is the real secret. And who can have that mercy or grace? Those who have dedicated their life for serving the Supreme Lord under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master. And that was the case with Maharaj Pariksit. His life was dedicated for Krishna's service. And he got a very, very able spiritual master like Shukadeva Goswami.

**Key Quote:** "As long as the great powerful son of Abhimanyu remains the emperor of the world, there is no chance that the personality of Kali will flourish."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Srimad Bhagavatam 1.18.5, explaining that as long as Parikshit Maharaj ruled, the influence of Kali could not flourish.

Tavit kalina prabhavet pravishto piha sarvatah yavad isho mahan urvyam abhimanyava ekarat. The meaning of this fifth verse is: as long as the great powerful son of Abhimanyu remains the emperor of the world, there is no chance that the personality of Kali will flourish. We discussed in detail the influence of Kali. Kali's influence is to entice people to engage in irreligion, adharma bandhu. So people become sinful and they miss the valuable opportunity in the human form of life to prepare oneself to go back to Godhead. So Kali cannot influence people. Kali cannot flourish as long as there is an emperor like Pariksit Maharaj ruling the entire world. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, as we have already explained, the personality of Kali had entered the jurisdiction of this earth long ago and he was looking for an opportunity to spread his influence all over the world. This will be explained in the next verse. The very day Krishna left this planet, after winding up his pastimes at the end of Dwapar Yuga, Kali, Purusha, tried to enter the earth planet. Kali was looking for an opportunity but he could not do so satisfactorily due to the presence of Maharaj Pariksit. That is a way of good government. The disturbing elements like the personality of Kali will always try to extend their nefarious activities. But it is the duty of the able state to check them by all means.

**Key Quote:** "If people do not use their excess wealth...for Sankirtana, for Krishna consciousness, then that accumulated wealth becomes the place for breeding all kinds of sinful activities."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Parikshit Maharaj's governance, highlighting how he prevented Kali's influence by utilizing wealth for Krishna's Sankirtana, contrasting it with the sinful use of wealth in the present Kali Yuga.

Pariksit stopped Kali. Of course he was ready to kill Kali Purusha. But Kali Purusha surrendered. Pariksit Maharaj spared his life. That is the code of conduct for the king: that surrendered souls should never be killed. But at the same time, Kali was not given any opportunity for spreading his evil influence among the citizens of Pariksit Maharaj's kingdom. Although Maharaj Pariksit allotted places for the personality of Kali, at the same time he gave no chance for the citizens which swayed by the personality of Kali. How did he do that? He actually utilized all the stored gold for propagating the glories of the Supreme Lord Krishna for Krishna's Sankirtana. And that is the way to prevent the influence of Kali. If people do not use their excess wealth beyond what they require, minimum required for their bodily maintenance, beyond that, if they don't use the excess wealth for Sankirtana, for Krishna consciousness, then that accumulated wealth becomes the place for breeding all kinds of sinful activities. Like it is happening now, we can see that people use their excess wealth simply for sinful ways of enjoying sense gratification. So that chance was not given because of the strong governance of Pariksit Maharaj and that's being said here. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "the king who is the best amongst human beings is as good as the personality of Godhead because he is trained, he represents the Supreme Lord, he acts according to the Vedic injunctions given by the Supreme Lord"
**Summary:** The speaker explains verse 42, emphasizing the importance of a king's training, his representation of God, and his duty to protect citizens, highlighting how King Parikshit was glorified for his virtuous rule.

In this session, we will be discussing from two verses, the 42nd and the 43rd verses of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 42nd verse is as follows: नवैं रिभिर नरदेवं पराख्यं सम्मातुम अर्हसी अविपक्व बुद्धे यत्तेजसा दुर्विशहेण गुप्ता विन्दन्ति भद्राणि अकुतो भया प्रजाह. The meaning of this 42nd verse: O my boy, that Shamika Rishi is addressing his son Shringi, O my boy, your intelligence is immature, अपक्व बुद्धी, and therefore you have no knowledge that the king, who is the best amongst human beings, is as good as the personality of Godhead because he is trained, he represents the Supreme Lord, he acts according to the Vedic injunctions given by the Supreme Lord, so he is as good as the personality of Godhead. He is never to be placed on equal footing with common men. The citizens of the state live in prosperity being protected by his unsurpassable prowess. The sage himself, Rishi Shamika, he was able to nicely sit in his ashram and do tapasya without के लिए रोग और शिवाशिय और वापस से डिस्टर्बेंस से सोचे कि यह आराज उत्पास के लिए सुरति से पावधि कि अ उड़ी इसके साथ बार रूस में महाराज अरक्षीप महाराज इन दुष्पा पूछा उनको पर अधिक से नियुक्त नहीं भूल मिलागा इसुद ने उन्हें किंदम परिचित नाराज। ताज कि कैसे शत्य ख़ूंद बताए जाता है कि शमीका रुषी ने पता आ जाता है। So the Rishi is describing his son as immature. He is a small boy. He definitely doesn't have the maturity when to use his brahmanical power to curse somebody to die. He doesn't have a maturity and he doesn't know the position of the king, especially the emperor who is ruling the world so nicely that everyone is well protected by the unsurpassable prowess of Parikshit Maharaja. He is such a great king that people are living, they are experiencing safety and they are prosperous under the rule of Parikshit Maharaja. They are prosperous. Earlier there is a description when Parikshit Maharaja was touring the state, all the citizens received him very nicely and they were glorifying his rule that because he was the descendant of the great devotees of Krishna, the Pandavas, therefore they were glorifying not only Parikshit but also glorifying the Pandavas and glorifying Krishna who was actually guiding the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "one trained Monarch is far better than hundreds of useless ministerial rogues"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the qualities of a trained monarch with the shortcomings of modern democracy, where leaders may lack proper training and qualifications, leading to the exploitation of citizens in Kali Yuga.

By qualification, not merely by some occupying some post, decorating himself with a position, I am the king, I am the greatest, no, not simply some empty words or pride because pride somebody declares themselves as great, no, he actually has got the qualities of God and he is empowered by the Supreme Lord to protect the citizens. The battle of Kurukshetra was planned by the Lord to establish the real representative of the Lord, Maharaja Yudhishthira. Krishna is interested in protecting all the citizens by having his representative rule over the citizens. So the example is given that Krishna established Yudhishthira Maharaj as the emperor of the world, an ideal king thoroughly trained by culture and devotional service with the martial spirit makes a perfect king. So Prabhupada is comparing the present day government system of government with the previous system of government where the king was ruling. Such a personal monarchy is far better than the so called death, such a personal monarchy is far better than the so called death democracy of no training and responsibility. Simply by votes, these are representatives of the government, they rule, they sit in the, occupy the seat of power and they rule as elected representatives. Now what is his qualification? He has secured votes, that's all. That's the only qualification he has. He doesn't have any training, he doesn't have any, he has not acquired good qualities by education, training, culture, not necessarily. I mean not necessarily, I'm not condemning all the representatives but I'm just telling even without qualification somebody may by simply acquiring votes occupy the post. The thieves and rogues of modern democracy seek election by misrepresentation of votes and the successful rogues and thieves devour the mass of people. One trained Monarch is far better than hundreds of useless ministerial rogues and it is hinted herein that by abolition of a monarchical regime like that of Maharaj Parikshit, the mass of people become open to many attacks of the age of Kali. So Kali Yuga is characterized by the garment ruling over the people not having the proper qualification. So in the absence of a good king what really happens in the society will be.

**Key Quote:** "Nowadays there is no value for human life. Especially if the person who dies is a most ordinary citizen. Nobody cares."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the consequences of Kali Yuga, highlighting the lack of value for human life, the exploitation of women, and the general degradation of society.

And for all these sins, we shall be responsible. This is Rishi Shamika foreseeing the consequences of the abolition of the monarchical regime of such a great Rajarshi as Pariksit Maharaj. What will happen? Plundering of the people's wealth by rogues and thieves. What is exactly happening now? In many places, there is no safety for people in general. And as Kali Yuga progresses, the thieves and rogues will increase. The number of thieves and rogues will increase, and people's hard-earned money, honest people's hard-earned money, will be plundered by these rogues and thieves. Might is right. That's going to be the situation. When the government is weak or corrupt, or untrained, unqualified people occupying the post of the head of state, there will be great social disruptions. Society will be completely spoiled. That means people will be killed and injured. Nowadays there is no value for human life, especially if the person who dies is a most ordinary citizen. Nobody cares. Nobody cares that everybody has a right to live. But ordinary, insignificant, common people, if they somehow manage to survive or subsist, that's okay. But otherwise, nobody cares for them in this age of Kali, as Kali Yuga progresses. And animals and women will be stolen. Here, animals means the domestic animals. And women, women are unprotected in Kali Yuga. So many cases are being reported. More and more we can hear how women are exploited, women are unprotected, women are insulted.

**Key Quote:** "In a cultured society, five categories of people are offered protection. Brahmanas, women, children, old people and cows."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts a cultured society with the current degraded state, emphasizing the lack of protection for vulnerable groups and criticizing the democratic system as a means for plunderers to exploit the state's wealth.

So, this is a degraded society. In a cultured society, five categories of people are offered protection: Brahmanas, women, children, old people and cows. This is a proper cultured society, where there is perfect protection for everyone, and especially these five categories of vulnerable people are specially protected. Whereas, in present age, we don't see special protection for any of these five categories of personalities. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, the word Naha, V, is very significant in this verse. The sage, that is Shamika Rishi, rightly takes the responsibility of the Brahmanas as a community, for killing monarchical government. His own son wrongly cursed Parikshit Maharaj. So, Rishi Shamika is taking responsibility that the Brahmanas as a community have destroyed this monarchical regime, and thus giving an opportunity to the so-called Democrats, who are generally plunderers of the wealth of the state subjects. So, Srila Prabhupada explains what is going on in the present time, because he is the Acharya, who has appeared in this particular time of the Kali Yuga. Acharya points out, through the scriptural statements, how there are anomalies in the society that needs to be corrected, if people expect to live peacefully, and happily, and with prosperity. Then, what is required to be done? First of all, the government by so-called Democrats, democratic system. Democratic system means simply a person gets votes, and he occupies the position of a ruler. So, the so-called Democrats are generally plunderers of the wealth of the state subjects.

### irresponsible rulers, taxation, disturbance

**Key Quote:** "And thus, instead of one king, a number of irresponsible kings grow up to tax the citizens."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to critique the democratic system, arguing that it leads to irresponsible rulers who prioritize personal gratification and burden citizens with excessive taxes, causing disturbance and plundering.

How does it happen? Prabhupada explains, the so-called Democrats capture the administrative machine without assuming responsibility for the prosperous condition of citizens. They have no responsibility that I will ensure the citizens will be taken care of nicely. There is no guarantee, there is no assurance, there is no proper mechanism to ensure that the rulers will properly take care of the subjects. Everyone captures the post for personal gratification. That is happening more and more now than earlier times, and they want their own enjoyment. And thus, instead of one king, a number of irresponsible kings grow up to tax the citizens. Formerly, the king used to collect taxes from the citizens who would be wealth generators, the Vaishyas. Only the Vaishyas were taxed. The Kshatriyas are protectors of the citizens, so they are not taxed. The Brahmanas don't accept any salary, so there's no question of asking tax from them. The Shudras are not given money, but they're given all the necessities. So they happily are taken care of, and they serve very nicely, ensuring that they actually make spiritual progress to achieve spiritual perfection, protected by the upper three classes. The Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, protect the Shudras. So only the Vaishyas, who are wealth generators, they are taxed by one king, not multiple kings. But here, the taxes are so many. So many taxes. And there is state tax, central tax, and earlier there used to be something called city tax. Now that has been abolished. So many taxes. It is foretold herein that in the absence of good monarchical government, everyone will be the cause of disturbance for others, by plundering riches, animals, women, etc.

### degraded civilization, unwanted population, dogs and monkeys

**Key Quote:** "At that time, the people in general, will fall systematically, from a path of a progressive civilization...there will be an unwanted population, on the level of dogs and monkeys."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 45, explaining how the decline in Vedic principles leads to a degraded civilization and an unwanted population characterized by animalistic tendencies.

This is a fact. We all have experience of this. The forty fifth verse, tadarya dharmah praviliyate nrnam, varnashramacharayutas trayimayah, tato artha kamabhi niveshitatmanam, shunam kapinam, iva varna sankaraham. This is a very strong verse. The meaning of this verse is: at that time, the people in general will fall systematically from a path of a progressive civilization, in respect to the qualitative engagements of the castes and orders of society. There is a standard, that civilized society, there are brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra, brahmachari, all of them are responsible. They properly follow the injunctions, and the whole society in this way is progressive. But people will fall from the standard of following the respective rules and regulations of the varna divisions and ashrama divisions. Thus they will be more attracted to economic development for sense gratification. They are simply interested in money. And money for what? Simply for enjoying their senses, some or the other. And as a result, there will be an unwanted population on the level of dogs and monkeys, shunam, kapinam, varna sankaraham. This is a unwanted population. And the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, it is foretold herein that in the absence of a monarchical regime, the general mass of people will be an unwanted population, like dogs and monkeys. Why they are compared to dogs and monkeys? As the monkeys are too sexually inclined, and dogs are shameless in sexual intercourse, the general mass of population, born of illegitimate connection, will systematically go astray from the Vedic way of good manners, and qualitative engagements in the castes and orders of life.

**Key Quote:** "The Vedic way of life is a progressive march, of the civilization of Aryans...they always have the goal of going back home, back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of good progeny and the Vedic way of life for spiritual progress, contrasting it with the degradation and unfortunate situation of Kali Yuga, where people are losing the opportunity for eternal happiness and knowledge.

Unless there is good progeny, sat santana, that happens by the husband and wife combining together according to the rules and regulations of the Vedic scriptures. There is a certain way of actually generating good population. It is not that by accident somebody is born with bad qualities, and somebody else is born with good qualities. No. There is no accident. So this is science. Complete science. So, when there is no proper ruler, who trains, and who directs, and who enforces good practices, the population will become completely degraded. The Vedic way of life is a progressive march of the civilization of Aryans. Aryans are those who know the values of life, and they always have the goal of going back home, back to Godhead, where there is no birth, no death, no disease, no old age, and no miseries. The Vedas direct everyone not to remain in the darkness of material world, but to go towards the light of spiritual kingdom, far beyond the material sky. So this whole varnashrama is designed in such a way that the entire population of human beings will actually follow the Vedic directions, and in that way, they'll produce good progeny, and the whole population will simply make progress towards going back home, back to Godhead. So people will not misuse or lose this opportunity of the human form of life to prepare themselves for eternal life of happiness and knowledge. So, this is the unfortunate situation in this Kali Yuga. People are degraded, they don't have good progeny, and gradually society is becoming more and more degraded. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 46th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining the context of Shamika Rishi's reaction to his son cursing King Pariksit.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session we will be discussing from the 46th verse of the 18th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The verse: Dharmapalo Narapati Hi Satu Samrat Brihat Shavaha Sakshat Mahabhagavato Rajarshir Hayamedhayat Rajarshir Hayamedhayat Kshutrut Shrama Uthodino Naivasmat Sapa Arhati. The meaning of this verse is: The emperor Pariksit is a pious king. He is highly celebrated and is the first-class devotee of the personality of Godhead, equal capacity to all stations. He is a saint amongst royalty and he has performed many hard sacrifices. When such a king is tired and fatigued, being stricken with hunger and thirst, he does not at all deserve to be cursed. These are words spoken by Shamika Rishi on learning from his son that his son had cursed King Emperor Pariksit just because Emperor Pariksit, when he was thirsty and hungry, he came looking for water in Shamika Rishi's ashram. Not finding water, he became upset and he took a dead snake and put it round the shoulder of the Rishi who was sitting in meditation in trance

and walked away. So the reaction of the son of Shamika Rishi, Shringi, was to become very angry against the king and curse the king to die within seven days. So here Shamika Rishi is saying that he has cursed the king to die within seven days. So here Shamika Rishi is telling, "Who have you cursed, foolish boy, out of your immaturity?" He is particularly telling because that king is emperor of the world and his qualifications are being mentioned here by Rishi Shamika. He does not at all deserve to be cursed. So what is the meaning of this? What are all the qualifications of this king? Firstly, he is a pious king. He is highly celebrated and is a first-class devotee of the personality of Godhead. How can such a person be ever cursed by anybody? And that too, what he has done is a very, very small mistake. Such a great personality for a small mistake has been cursed to die. It is completely wrong on

the part of this boy Shringi to have cursed the emperor of the world. He is a Rajarishi, saint amongst royalty. He has performed many horse sacrifices and such sacrifices were performed by the king or the emperor for the welfare of the entire state, for the welfare of all citizens. As a duty, a king is supposed to perform sacrifices for the protection of welfare, prosperity of these citizens of the world, of the entire kingdom. When such a king is tired, fatigued, thirsty, hungry, he does not at all deserve to be cursed. And what kind of curse is it? To die within seven days? It is not at all justified to curse such a king. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, after explaining the general codes relating to the royal position and asserting the king can do no wrong and therefore is never to be condemned because a king has a great responsibility for ruling the kingdom and ruling the kingdom is no small task. His kingdom is the entire

world. Such a responsible king, such a heavy duty he has to perform and his position is so exalted that in his position, when he has taken responsibility, it is to be considered that such a king can do no wrong in the sense that even if he does some small mistake, he should never be considered as the object of punishment by anyone. The sage Shamika wanted to say something about Emperor Pariksit specifically. First he spoke in general about a king who is a responsible king should not be considered to do something wrong for a small mistake. But now the king who has been cursed is not just a dutiful king. He is the emperor of the world. He is Emperor Pariksit, descendant of the Kuru dynasty, Bharata Vamsa, descendant of the Pandavas. That emperor has been cursed. So what are his specific qualifications? So the specific qualifications of Maharaja Pariksit is summarized here by Shamika Rishi. The king, even calculated as a king only, was most celebrated as a ruler who administered the religious principles of the Royal Order. According to the scriptures, the kings have got specific duties to perform and they are very clearly defined. The kings have specific duty to perform and they are very clearly elaborated in the scriptures: Kshatriya Dharma. In the Dharma Shastras, there is clear delineation of Brahmana Dharma, Kshatriya Dharma, Vaishya Dharma, Shudra Dharma, Brahmachari Dharma, Grahastha Dharma, Vanaprastha Dharma, Sanyas Dharma, Shri Dharma, Raja Dharma. Like this, all different duties of different classes of people, under different circumstances, in different situations.

**Summary:** The speaker mentions the qualities of a Kshatriya as described in the Bhagavad-Gita and states that Pariksit possessed all those qualities.

if he is a ruler who is a strict follower of those Dharma Shastras, such a ruler is never to be punished, cursed by anyone.

leadership. These are the qualities. So, heroism means he is bold, he is a man of his heart and he is like the ideal in leading people, in protecting people. He is the ideal hero. Just like Pariksit Maharaj, how he dealt with Kalipurusha. When he saw Kalipurusha is harming a cow and a bull, immediately he told him that you are a hero, took out his sword and said you deserve to be killed, you don't deserve to live, punishment, capital punishment for harming a cow and a bull exactly according to shastra. So heroism he displays. Power, he is a very powerful king. He tours his whole kingdom and all the people offer him tributes. He is so powerful. Determination, he is very, very strongly determined to do his duties. Resourcefulness, he is resourceful enough to arrange to provide for all the needs of the people. Courage, courage in battle, when he challenged Kalipurusha, Kalipurusha could understand that my life is in danger, so he's Kalipurusha surrendered to Pariksit. Elsewhere it is described when Pariksit used to tour his kingdom, all the kings simply used to come and pay their tributes without his even challenging them. That was how he was courageous. Generosity, he used to properly give in charity to the deserving, to the brahmanas, when he used to perform sacrifices, liberally he used to give charity to the brahmanas, dhanam. And leadership, he is the ideal role model for the other people in his conduct. In his conduct he is the ideal person. So he leads people by his own example. That's the perfect leader and people have got confidence in this leadership because they are very nicely protected, they are provided for, they are guided correctly. So he is the ideal

leader. So such a great devotee, how can he be cursed? So from all sides it is admitted by Shamika Rishi that Maharaj Pariksit was cursed most unjustly. Although for this boy's childish action, the brahmanas cannot be blamed, but still Shamika Rishi took responsibility for this act of this brahmachari boy, his own son, who wrongly used the brahmanical power as a result of which there is the deterioration of all the other orders in the whole world because unless the brahmanas are properly situated, they cannot lead and inspire and guide the other orders of society, the kshatriyas, vaishyas, sudras. Just like in our body, if the head is in order, brain is in order, all other parts can work properly, but the brain itself is not in order, change of the body means change of the body. If the brain is in order, then the action is good, then a good action in order. Even if the other organs are in good condition, they cannot function. So like that the brahmanas have to be ideal, then only the society can function.

The meaning of this verse is: Then the Rishi prayed to the all-pervading personality of Godhead to pardon his iniquity. He was an immature boy who had no intelligence and who committed the great sin of cursing a person who was completely free from all sins, who was subordinate and who deserved to be protected. So this is the statement of Suta Goswami to the sages of Naimisharanya.

**Key Quote:** "When an offense is done unto the devotee of the Lord it is very difficult to overcome the reaction."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the law of karma and the severe consequences of offending a devotee of the Lord (Vaishnava Aparadh).

He is describing the whole incident leading to Pariksit Maharaj renouncing his kingdom and meeting Shukadeva Goswami, after which the Bhagavatam was spoken by Shukadeva Goswami to Pariksit Maharaj. So Srila Prabhupada explains elaborately this in the purport: Everyone is responsible for his own action either pious or sinful. This is the law of karma in this material world. Rishi Shamika could foresee that his son had committed a great sin by cursing Maharaj Pariksit, who deserved to be protected by the Brahmanas, for he, that is Pariksit Maharaj, was a pious ruler and completely free from all sins because of his being a first-class devotee of the Lord. So Pariksit Maharaj as a pure devotee deserves to be protected by the Brahmanas. Instead he is being cursed. It is totally unjust. So Srila Prabhupada further says: When an offense is done unto the devotee of the Lord it is very difficult to overcome the reaction.

Vaishnava Aparath is very, very, very dangerous. Generally Vaishnava Aparath cannot be overcome. By the person who has committed that offense or Aparath, it cannot be overcome. So further Srila Prabhupada says: The Brahmanas being at the head of the social orders are meant to give protection to their subordinates and not to curse them. A superior when dealing with somebody who is a subordinate, has to be considered; if they do some mistake, they cannot be disproportionately punished. In general they should not be punished when they make a mistake, especially when they are subordinate and they have not done a big mistake. For their small mistakes they should not be punished.

**Key Quote:** "Above the law of nature is the Supreme Lord's personal superintendence."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the specific case of Pariksit Maharaj's cursing, highlighting the foolish boy's pride and emphasizing Krishna's personal control over nature.

There are occasions when a Brahmana may furiously curse a subordinate Kshatriya or Vaishya. But in the case of Maharaj Pariksit there were no grounds as already explained. This was explained elaborately in the previous verse. The foolish boy had done it out of sheer vanity; vanity means pride, in being a Brahmana's son and thus he became liable to be punished by the law of God. Above the law of nature is the Supreme Lord's personal superintendence. This is very important to note. It appears like the nature's laws are working in an impersonal way because we don't see generally the hand of any person. Just like the seasons are changing, the sun is rising every day, and what is the explanation of the scientists? So called scientists. They have no explanation how it is happening. Scriptures are very clear: Bhishasmat vatapavate bhisho deti suryaha. Out of fear of the Supreme Lord who is the controller, director of the entire material nature, the sun is rising every day. The wind is blowing properly to ensure supply of the air for all the living beings on the earth. This is unknown to modern scientists. This is unknown to most people in this in today's world.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's supreme control and administration, His affection for devotees (Bhakta Vatsala), and the distinction between sin and offense.

Krishna is the supreme director, controller, master. Under him there is a whole big administration of the devatas, headed by Brahma. Everyone is working under the superintendence of Krishna. This is unknown. So here Prabhupada is pointing out if some of the devatas, subordinate controllers make a mistake then they are liable to be punished by God Krishna. So Prabhupada further says: The Lord never forgives a person who condemns his pure devotee. Krishna is very, very attached to his pure devotees. He is called Bhakta Vatsala. Therefore by cursing a king the foolish Sringi had committed not only a sin but also the greatest offense.

**Key Quote:** "Offense is dealt with only by the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to differentiate between sin and offense, emphasizing that only the Supreme Lord can pardon offenses and alter the laws of nature.

There is a difference between offense and sin. Sin is directly violating the laws of nature in our material activities. Offense is any offense done to a pure devotee, to a Vaishnava. Offending a Vaishnava is on a different level. Committing a sin whereby one violates the material laws of nature is different. Therefore the Rishi could foresee that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead could save his boy from his sinful act. Offense is dealt with only by the Supreme Lord, directly. The other subordinate controllers in material nature have no role to play. They cannot do anything about the offense. Further Srila Prabhupada says he therefore directly prayed for pardon from the Supreme Lord who alone can undo a thing which is impossible to change. Even the laws of nature which work perfectly, they can be changed only by Krishna. Nobody else can change it.

**Key Quote:** "Even the laws of nature which work perfectly they can be changed only by Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates Krishna's power to change the laws of nature and raises the question of why the Brahmana's son was made responsible for cursing Pariksit Maharaj.

No Devata, no Yogi, no Tapasvi, no Jnani, no Rishi can change any of the laws of nature. They are working perfectly. But Krishna can change. The appeal was made in the name of a foolish boy who had developed no intelligence at all. Rishi Shamika is appealing to the Supreme Lord that my boy who is a foolish boy he made a mistake. It was a big mistake but he is a foolish boy kindly pardoned him. Now Srila Prabhupada further explains very nicely a question may be raised herein that since it was the desire of the Lord that Pariksit Maharaj be put into that awkward position so that he might be delivered from material existence then why was a Brahmana's son made responsible for this offensive act?

**Key Quote:** "So Krishna arranged a child to make a mistake of cursing Pariksit."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna arranged for a child to commit the offense so that he could be easily excused, and the father's prayer would be accepted.

See earlier it is explained that Pariksit could not have become angry against this sage Shamika Rishi. Normally according to his proper conduct as a pure devotee. It was arranged by Krishna. So actually it is not Pariksit's mistake at all to have become angry against Shamika Rishi and provoke that Brahmana boy the son of the Rishi. No. Pariksit is not at fault. Krishna arranged it, so that Bhagavatam can be spoken. That was Krishna's higher purpose. But then why is the Brahmana's son made responsible? The Brahmana's son has made the mistake. Why is he in the picture? Is the question that may be raised. So Srila Prabhupada says the answer is that the offensive act was performed by child only so that he could be excused very easily. So Krishna arranged a child to make a mistake of cursing Pariksit, so that the child can be excused because children if they make a mistake they are not to be punished like an adult who makes a mistake. And thus the prayer of the father was accepted. Krishna accepted. Yes. Your boy is a foolish boy. He is an immature boy. He deserves to be pardoned for his mistake. Big mistake.

### Brahmana Community's Responsibility, Kali's Influence, Demons in Brahmana Families

**Key Quote:** "Why the Brahmana community as a whole was made responsible for allowing Kali into the world affairs."
**Summary:** The speaker raises the question of why the entire Brahmana community is held responsible for Kali's influence and explains that demons were allowed to take birth in Brahmana families in Kali Yuga.

Then further Prabhupada raises another question. If the question is raised why the Brahmana community as a whole was made responsible for allowing Kali into the world affairs. See one Brahmachari boy misusing his Brahmanical power. The whole Brahmana community is held responsible that Kali has entered through this boy and is now going to pollute the rest of the Brahmanas in Kali Yuga become polluted. So why the whole Brahmana community as a whole is getting polluted by this whole act. So the answer Srila Prabhupada says for this is given in the Varaha Purana. What is the answer in the Varaha Purana? The demons who acted inimically toward personality of Godhead but were not killed by the Lord by Lord Krishna when Krishna incarnated in Dwapara Yuga end of Dwapara Yuga. Such demons were allowed to take birth in the families of Brahmanas to take advantage of the age of Kali. So who are these Brahmanas in Kali Yuga who don't follow the Brahmanical principles but act irreligiously under the influence of Kali. These Brahmanas were formerly demons who deserve to be killed and purified by the Supreme Lord but they did not they were not killed. So such Brahmanas are taking birth in Brahmana families in the age of Kali in which they are polluted.

**Key Quote:** "The all-merciful Lord gave them a chance to have their births in families of pious Brahmanas so that they could progress towards salvation."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by explaining that the demons were given a chance for purification by taking birth in Brahmana families, but they often misuse the opportunity due to pride and vanity, ending with a thank you and Hare Krishna.

So Srila Prabhupada says further the all-merciful Lord gave them a chance to have their births in families of pious Brahmanas so that they could progress towards salvation. The demons missed the chance of being killed by the Supreme Lord and thereby become purified. So now they are given another chance for purification. Take birth in Brahmana families and thereby make some progress towards ultimate liberation. But the demons instead of utilizing the good opportunity misuse the Brahmanical culture due to being puffed up by vanity in becoming Brahmanas. Now Kali Yuga there is a good opportunity taking birth in a Brahmana family in any age there is good opportunity to make progress. But if they don't utilize then they are the losers. That's what is explained here. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains that pure devotees are tolerant and do not retaliate even when wronged.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 48th verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Tiraskrita vipralabdhaha shaptahah shivta hata api nashetat pratikurvanti tattbhaktah prabhavo api hi. The meaning of this verse is, "The devotees of the Lord are so forbearing that even though they are defamed, cheated, cursed, disturbed, neglected, or even killed, they are never inclined to avenge themselves." This is a word spoken by Suta Goswami glorifying a pure devotee of the Lord. What is the quality of a pure devotee? They are always very, very, very, very tolerant: titikshava karunika surdha sarva dehi naam. In another place in Bhagavatam, third canto, Lord Kapila describes pure devotees. Titikshava, first quality he says of a pure devotee, he is very, very tolerant, so tolerant that when they are defamed, they are cheated, they are cursed, they are disturbed, neglected, or even killed, they

**Key Quote:** "The supreme lord cannot tolerate his devotee being harmed by anybody else"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Durvasa Muni and Ambarisha Maharaja to illustrate how the Lord protects his devotees and punishes those who offend them.

never react. They will never take action against those who misbehave, is so tolerant. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains Rishi Shamika knew that the Lord does not forgive a person who has committed an offense at the feet of a devotee. Move it definitely. The, obviamente, the Lord is not concise till we understand it is clear. So Straight Government today is to help benefit the poorasto, that is already been explained earlier. Therefore, he begged forgiveness from the Lord on behalf of his son. But, ah, what can the Lord do? Code 3, shelter of the devotee, like it happened in the case of Durvasamuni. When Durvasamuni offended Ambarish Maharaj, Ambarish Maharaj is a pure devotee, so Ambarish Maharaj did not retaliate, but the Supreme Lord cannot tolerate his devotee being harmed by anybody else. So when Durvasamuni started to harass Ambarish Maharaj by creating one Rakshasa to harass him, harass Ambarish Maharaj, immediately Krishna sent a Sudarshan chakra to kill that Rakshasa immediately, immediately. Then that Sudarshan chakra did not stop at that. Sudarshan chakra started chasing Durvasamuni himself. Durvasamuni tried to escape by all his mystic power, he could not escape. Finally, he thought of taking shelter of some powerful devatas, that didn't work. Finally, he was directed to go to Vishnu himself, who is actually the one who has released the Sudarshan chakra. So when he went to Vishnu, Vishnu said, "I am completely under the subordination of my pure devotees, so if at all you want any relief, you can get relief only if you are pardoned by Ambarish Maharaj whom you have offended."

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee is callous about worldly advantages or reverses."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the qualities of a pure devotee, emphasizing their indifference to worldly gains and losses and their willingness to tolerate personal offenses.

So Durvasamuni had Canyonаровός to come back to Ambarish Maharaj whom he had offended. So therefore, Prabhupada says the Lord can only give direction to take shelter of the devotee whom somebody has offended to get free from the offense. Further, Srila Prabhupada says he thought within himself, that is Rishi Shamika is thinking, that if Maharaj Pariksit would counter curse the boy, he might be saved. The boy can be saved from any action being taken by the Lord if Pariksit Maharaj would have taken some action against the boy. But Rishi Shamika knew also that a pure devotee is callous about worldly advantages or reverses. He knew that Pariksit Maharaj will never take any counter action against the boy because he is a pure devotee. He tolerates any amount of inconvenience for the personal self, a pure devotee simply tolerates. As such, the devotees are never inclined to counteract personal deformation, curses, negligence, and aversion. As far as such things are concerned, in personal affairs the devotees do not care.

**Key Quote:** "He considers that to be the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes a verse spoken by Brahma, explaining that pure devotees see difficulties as the mercy of the Lord and believe they deserve worse punishment for their past misdeeds.

Tattenu Kampaamsu Sameeksham Ano Bunjana Evatma Krta Mvipakam. Hrid-Vaagva Purubhya Vidadhan Namaste Jivetayo Mukti Padesha Dayabhak. This is a verse spoken by Brahma. He has shown in offering his prayers to Krishna after the Brahma Vimohana Leela. What is Brahma saying this prayer? He says, "My dear Lord, those who are your pure devotees," Brahma is glorifying Krishna's pure devotees. He's telling Krishna, "Your pure devotees whenever they are facing some danger in the material world, only the material world this can happen, some danger, some deformation, some difficulty, some insult, anything that a pure devotee faces like this, he considers that to be the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." A pure devotee does not think, "I am a pure devotee. I am fully dedicated and surrender to Krishna. Why does Krishna not prevent me from suffering?" So pure devotee never thinks like that. A pure devotee thinks that, "Let me gladly suffer whatever difficulty is, dangers, or miseries, or any situation in this material world, let me undergo, let me tolerate, suffer with tolerance. Why? Because the pure devotee thinks actually I deserve to suffer much, much more for my own past misdeeds, Atma Krita Vipakam. But Krishna is so kind to me that He is not giving me the punishment, which is the proper punishment which is due to my own misdeeds. I don't know I'm getting what I deserve. I am getting a small token, a small token of what I deserve to get. So that is Krishna's mercy upon me." That's how the pure devotee thinks.

**Key Quote:** "Then this pure devotee will not tolerate will not sit quiet. He will take proper action against the offender"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the devotee's tolerance of personal offenses with their active response to offenses against the Lord or other devotees, explaining why Shamika Rishi appealed to the Lord instead of Pariksit Maharaja.

But in the case of an offense committed by somebody against the Lord or Lord's other devotees, then the pure devotee takes strong action against the offender. So the way a pure devotee deals with somebody who's committing an offense, it's the consideration is twofold: if somebody offends the pure devotee himself, the pure devotee does not take any action against the offender. He tolerates whatever the offender might have done. But if the offender is offending the Supreme Lord or other pure devotees, then this pure devotee will not tolerate, will not sit quiet. He will take proper action against the offender. It was a personal affair and therefore Shamika Rishi knew that the king would not take counteraction. That Rishi Shamika knew because he knew Pariksit Maharaj is a pure devotee. Thus there was no alternative than to place an appeal to the Lord for the immature boy. Why did the Shamika Rishi appeal to the Supreme Lord and not to Pariksit Maharaj? Because Pariksit Maharaj, he knew, will never take any counteraction, will never take an offense. So don't have to go and ask him pardon, is he will never take any counteraction, but what about the Lord? Lord is not going to tolerate, so therefore,

### devotee power, service, example

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee is the most powerful personality in the entire creation."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the power of a pure devotee, even exceeding that of a brahmana, and illustrates this with the example of Hanuman burning Lanka after Ravana insulted Lord Rama, highlighting that this power is used only in service to the Lord and his devotees.

So here for the Srila Prabhupada says it is not only that the brahmanas are powerful enough to award curses of blessings upon the subordinates, the devotee of the Lord, even though he may not be a Brahmana, is more powerful than a Brahmana. So here the pure devotee happens to be a Kshatriya, but generally Kshatriyas are subordinate to brahmanas. So even though Kshatriyas are definitely subordinate to brahmanas, but in the case of the Kshatriya being a pure devotee, such a pure devotee is more powerful than the brahmana, qualified brahmana. A pure devotee is the most powerful personality in the entire creation. He is more powerful than all the demigods, he is more powerful than the most pure brahmana, he is more powerful than all the jnanis, yogis, tapasvis, all kinds of people. He is more powerful than everybody. But a powerful devotee never misuses the power for personal benefit. This is the characteristic of a pure devotee. He knows he has power. As a pure devotee he knows. And that's how a pure devotee, because he is powerful, he can take action against offenders who are offenders against Krishna or offenders against other pure devotees. That's how a pure devotee can take action. He is capable, he is powerful to take action and he does so. What did Hanuman do? Hanuman burnt Lanka. Why? Because Ravana was blaspheming Lord Rama. At first when Hanuman went to get the whereabouts of Sita Devi, Hanuman was trying to see what is the strength of Ravana. So Hanuman did something by which Hanuman was taken in front of Ravana. So when he was taken in front of Ravana, Ravana first insulted Hanuman. Hanuman tolerated silently. But when Ravana started insulting Rama, Hanuman became angry, and in that anger he burnt half of Lanka. So a devotee is very, very powerful pure devotee, but he will use that power only against offenders who are offenders of the Supreme Lord or offenders against other pure devotees. He will never use his power to counteract offenses committed by somebody against himself. Whatever power the devotee may have is always utilized in service towards the Lord and his devotees, other devotees. That's all.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Parikshit's garlanding the sage with a dead snake was not at all a very serious offense, but Shringi's cursing the king was a serious offense."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains verse 49, focusing on the incident of Parikshit Maharaj and the sage's son, emphasizing that Parikshit's action was a minor offense compared to the curse, and the boy's foolishness warranted pardon.

In this session we will be discussing two verses, the 49th and the 58th verses of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the last two verses of this chapter. This chapter is entitled Maharaj Parikshit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy. The 49th verse, Iti Putra Krita Ghena Sonu Tapto Mahamunihi Swayam Viprakrto Ragna Naiva Agham Tad Achintayat. The translation is, The Sage Dharamuddin thus regretted the sin committed by his own son. He did not take the insult paid by the king very seriously. Now this is summarizing the incident itself entirely. The whole chapter which is describing this incident, leading to Parikshit Maharaj renouncing his kingdom and thereby meeting Shikadeva Goswami and Bhagavatam being spoken and revealed for the benefit of the whole world. So in the Purport, Shila Prabhupada says, The whole incident is now cleared up. How is it cleared up? Maharaj Parikshit's garlanding the sage with a dead snake was not at all a very serious offense, but Shringi's cursing the king was a serious offense. So it's very clear. Now, Parikshit's action, which was the, which led to the whole incident of cursing by the Shamika Rishi's son, it is not at all a serious offense. And the cursing by Shringi was a very, very serious offense. Now, how is it adjusted? Very nicely it's adjusted. The serious offense is committed by foolish child only. Therefore, he deserved to be pardoned by the Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "The curse was in no way an impediment for him to achieve the highest perfection. Rather it became a kind of boon in disguise."
**Summary:** The speaker continues explaining the situation of Maharaj Parikshit, highlighting how he didn't mind the curse and used it as an opportunity to achieve liberation through hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam from Shukadeva Goswami.

Because the curse was given by a foolish boy. And the small boy has made a mistake unknowingly, immaturely, foolishly he has done a mistake. So he deserved to be pardoned by the Supreme Lord. Although it was not, it was not possible to get free from the sinful reaction. The reaction is, the sinful activity is very, very, very serious. So ordinarily a person cannot get away by committing such a very, very serious sinful activity. A grave sinful activity. Nobody can get away. But this case, specific case, the foolish boy deserves to be pardoned. Now, Maharaj Pariksit also did not mind the curse offered to him by a foolish Brahmana. This is Maharaj Pariksit's personal reaction. When he heard that he is going to die within seven days, having been cursed by the son of Shamika Rishi, so he did not mind at all. On the contrary, he took full advantage of the awkward situation. This clumsy situation in which Pariksit Maharaj had been placed. He took full advantage. What did he do? By a great will of the Lord, Maharaj Pariksit achieved the highest perfection of life through the grace of Srila Shukadeva Goswami. The events that led to Pariksit Maharaj achieving the highest perfection of life. The curse was in no way an impediment for him to achieve the highest perfection. Rather it became a kind of boon in disguise. They say boon in disguise. So it came as something very, very beneficial for Pariksit. That he took advantage by renouncing his kingdom and trying to prepare for meeting with death within one week. And in the course of that, he happened to meet Shukadeva Goswami and Shukadeva Goswami spoke the entire Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj. Pariksit Maharaj got enlightened and thereby he achieved the ultimate liberation and also others who heard also achieved the same destination. And in future, anybody by hearing Bhagavatam can get the highest perfection of life simply by hearing like Pariksit Maharaj did. Simply hearing Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "The whole series of events was a desire of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the events surrounding Parikshit Maharaj were part of the Lord's plan, using the analogy of Krishna using the Pandavas as instruments in the Kurukshetra war and Kala using instruments to bring about destruction.

Actually it was a desire of the Lord. The whole series of events was a desire of the Lord. And Maharaj Pariksit, Rishi Shamika and Rishi Shamika's son Shringi were all instrumental in fulfilling the desire of the Lord. The Lord wants to do something in the material world. Sometimes he directly does it. Sometimes he indirectly does it through somebody, through some instruments. Like it is actually Krishna only who killed all those Kauravas on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. But Krishna did it through the Pandavas headed by Arjuna. So Krishna tells Arjuna that I have already killed all these Kauravas. You can only be an instrument. As Kala, Krishna is always acting in this material world. Kala destroys everything in course of time. So destruction by Kala nobody can avoid. But sometimes Kala also uses some instrument to kill somebody. It is like people say natural death and death by some vehicle accident. So when it is death by vehicle accident people think oh he died because of vehicle accident. No it is Kala only who is using the vehicle accident as an instrument to actually destroy. Even if somebody dies a natural death it is Kala only who is actually bringing about the destruction. So similarly the Lord is using Maharaj Pariksit, Rishi Shamika and Shamika Sanshungi as instruments for his purpose.

That the Srimad Bhagavatam be spoken. None of them were put into difficulty because everything was done in relation with the Supreme Person. So when everything is in relationship with Krishna nothing is bad, nothing is wrong, nothing is punishable. The 50th verse, the last verse of this chapter. prayashaha sadavo loke paraidhvanveshu yojitah na vyathanti na hrishyanti yata atma agunashrayah The meaning of this verse is generally the transcendentalists even though engaged by others in the dualities of the material world are not distressed. Nor do they take pleasure in worldly things for they are transcendentally engaged.

**Key Quote:** "Conditioned souls are always busy trying to avoid material distress and trying to maximize material happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the behavior of conditioned souls, who seek material pleasure and avoid distress, with that of transcendentalists, who are indifferent to both.

Prabhupada explains this very nicely that those who are transcendentalists they are described as here sadavaha transcendentalists, saintly persons. They are never distressed or they are never happy in this material world. Why? Because they are always spiritually engaged. So they don't even consider what is the material situation. As materialists or as people who are under the crutches of maya we are always concerned whether we are getting material pleasure or material happiness and we try to avoid material distress. We are busy always. Conditioned souls are always busy trying to avoid material distress and trying to maximize material happiness. But the transcendentalists, the spiritualists those who are seriously engaged always in spiritual activities they never care whether by some reason they get material happiness or material distress. They don't care for either.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the three types of transcendentalists: jnanis, yogis, and bhaktas, and their respective goals of merging into the absolute, perceiving the Supersoul, and engaging in loving service to Krishna.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport the transcendentalists are of three kinds. The emperic philosophers the mystics and the devotees of the Lord. The jnanis, yogis and bhaktas. There is a samskara for that. Empiric philosophers aim at the perfection of merging into the being of the absolute. What is the ultimate goal of the emperic philosophers the jnanis those who cultivate spiritual knowledge with the aim of merging into the absolute truth. Sayujya mukti they want sayujya mukti. Mystics aim at perceiving the all pervading super soul. Mystics are the ashtanga yogis. Their goal is to realize the Paramatma who is all pervading in this material world. He is Paramatma is present in everyone's heart of every living being's heart and Paramatma is also present entered into every atom. So they want to perceive that Paramatma. This is their perfection. The ashtanga yogis. And devotees of the Lord are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the personality of God. Devotees pure devotees bhaktas they only want one thing. They want to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krishna. Now Srila Prabhupada further explains Since Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan are different phases of the same transcendence This is explained in the Bhagavatam. vadantita tattva vidas tattvam yad jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhavaneti sabhyate

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the three features of the Absolute Truth (Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan) and how each type of transcendentalist aims for one of these features, emphasizing that they are all non-dual.

All categories of transcendentalists their aim is the absolute truth only. But there are three features of the absolute truth and accordingly the three categories of transcendentalists are aiming for one of the features. The jnanis aim for Brahman. The mystic yogis or the ashtanga yogis aim for Paramatma and the devotees or bhaktas bhakti yogis aim at Bhagavan. But Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan are described in the Bhagavatam as advayagyana non-dual substance of the absolute truth. They are all the same. Therefore Prabhupada says these three categories of transcendentalists are beyond the three modes of material nature. All of them are transcendental to the three modes. Agunashrayaha Atma Agunashraya Those are transcendentalists. They are always beyond the modes. Material distress and happiness are products of the three modes. Always interactions of the three gunas produces either distress or happiness. Material distress or material happiness. That's the nature of this material existence. Therefore the causes of such material distress and happiness have nothing to do with the transcendentalists. Transcendentalists are engaged in spiritual activities because of which they don't care whether a material situation gives them happiness or distress. They don't care for that. Because they don't want they neither want happiness nor want distress. What do they want? They want the supreme.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by identifying Parikshit Maharaj as a devotee and Shamika Rishi as a mystic, explaining their detachment from the incident and reiterating that the child was an instrument of the Lord's will, ending the session with gratitude and Hare Krishna.

They only want the supreme. The king was a devotee and the rishi was a mystic. That's why all this is explained. Parikshit Maharaj was a pure devotee of the supreme lord. He was a he was a bhakta. And Shamika Rishi was a mystic yogi. So he was Shamika Rishi was also a transcendentalist seriously engaged in Ashtanga Yoga practice. That's why he was sitting in trance trying to fix his attention on the Paramatma within the heart. So therefore both of them were unattached to the accidental incident created by the supreme lord. Parikshit Maharaj did not mind the cursing of that boy. Shamika Rishi did not mind Parikshit Maharaj insulting him. Both are transcendentalists. The playful child was an instrument in fulfilling the lord's will. Other than these two the child was simply an instrument in the lord's plan. So I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the context of the verse, describing Parikshit Maharaj's encounter with Kali and the importance of understanding how to counteract Kali's influence.

So this verse follows the previous verse which described that Kali entered this earth planet long before Parikshit Maharaj started ruling. That is Krishna's disappearance. At the end of Dwapar Yuga, Krishna's disappearance. Then the Pandavas learned about that and then they retired, and they handed over charge of ruling the entire earth planet to Parikshit Maharaj. Then Parikshit Maharaj began ruling, and while he was storing his kingdom, he came across this personality of Kali. Kali was trying to enter his kingdom, but Parikshit Maharaj stopped him from engaging in his nefarious activities. So this particular verse is very important to understand what is the way to counteract the irreligious influence of this age of Kali.

So Srila Prabhupada explains in the Purport in some detail: The personality of Godhead and his holy name, qualities, etc., are all identical. This is very, very important to understand. This is the central point of our philosophy of Krishna consciousness. Krishna is absolutely divine and is the creator of heaven and earth. Krishna is absolute. Absolute means there is no difference at all between the person Krishna and his name, his form, his qualities, his activities, his abode, his paraphernalia, his pure devotees. All are identical.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that chanting Krishna's name directly connects one with Krishna, and that Krishna is present in the deity form due to His all-powerful nature.

Whereas Krishna is not like that. You say Krishna, you directly contact the supreme person Krishna in full. Krishna is fully present. Now we are not able to perceive the presence of Krishna in his name or in his deity form. We think this name is just another sound like so many other sounds, material sounds, no it is not. Or we think the deity in the temple is just a statue made of wood or stone or metal. We think it is just a representation. Somebody believes that in the statue of Krishna there is Krishna, they are thinking that is Krishna, no it's not what we think. You are not able to perceive the presence of Krishna in his name or in his body. It's not what we believe, it is what actually is the fact. Krishna is present in the form of the deity because he's all-powerful. He agrees to enter into the deity form when Krishna is invited by the proper spiritual process of deity installation. That's a big subject, I won't talk about that in the next lecture. I won't get into the details of that, but in the deity Krishna is present in his transcendental form.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Kali cannot influence those who constantly chant Hare Krishna, worship Krishna, and engage in devotional service, providing a practical method for protection from Kali's influence.

is fully present. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says the personality of Kali was not able to enter the jurisdiction of the earth due to the presence of the personality of Godhead. As long as Krishna incarnated and he was present on the earth, Kali could not enter. And similarly, if there is an arrangement for the constant chanting of the holy names, qualities, etc., of the supreme personality of Godhead, there is no chance at all for a personality of Kali to enter. Even now, if we chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Kali cannot touch us. Kali cannot enter our life. Kali cannot enter the jurisdiction of the place where such chanting goes on, where Srimad Bhagavatam is recited, where Krishna is worshipped in his Deity form, where topics of Krishna are discussed by devotees, where Krishna is remembered, where Krishna is glorified, where Krishna is offered food and Prasadam is distributed. Kali cannot influence. Kali cannot touch. Kali cannot enter. Kali cannot spread his influence. That is the technique of driving away the personality of Kali from the world. Now Kali is, Kali Yuga has begun, has started. Kali is present in this world, but Kali cannot influence, even if it is not Kali. Even if we use this technique of driving away Kali's influence by constant chanting Hare Krishna, or constantly engaging in different types of devotional service to Krishna, by constantly remembering Krishna, by constantly thinking of Krishna, by constantly hearing about Krishna.

### modern technology, broadcasting Krishna's name, counteracting evil influence

**Key Quote:** "If the state arranges to distribute transcendental sound by resounding the holy name, fame and activities of the Lord... then a favorable condition will be created... But we can drive away this evil influence by broadcasting the holy name of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how modern technology like radio and television can be used to broadcast the holy name of Krishna and counteract the evil influence of Kali, suggesting a practical application of devotional principles in the modern world.

So many ways, so many ways one can remain immune to the influence of Kali. In modernized human society there are great advancements of material science, and they have invented the radio to distribute sound in the air. Very good example Prabhupada is giving. Now it is not just radio, it is also the television. But when Prabhupada was writing this purport, at that time the radio was there available everywhere. Television was not available everywhere in all countries. So Prabhupada is writing radio is spreading that sound everywhere. So earlier they used to have what is called as a radio set. They initially had a big set. Then they had a pocket transistor or a pocket device, where you just switch on with a battery operated device, and you can hear by tuning into some radio station, some music or some commentary or some news etc. Exactly like now you can switch on a TV, which is connected through a dish antenna to the satellite, which is broadcasting some TV program from some channel. All over the world it broadcasts, and you catch that broadcast by dish antenna, and you watch that program on a TV. So instead of vibrating some nuisance sound for sense enjoyment, if the state arranges to distribute transcendental sound by resounding the holy name, fame and activities of the Lord, as they are authorized in the Bhagavad Gita or Srimad Bhagavatam, then a favorable condition will be created. The principles of religion in the world will be reestablished, and thus the executive heads who are so anxious to drive away corruption from the world will be successful. In the present age, there is so much of corruption, there is so much of evil influence due to so much rampant sinful activities all over the world, everywhere. But we can drive away this evil influence by broadcasting the holy name of the Supreme Lord, the transcendental sound, through radio, through television, through satellite TV broadcasting, etc. Nothing is bad if properly used for the service of the Lord. There is radio, TV, all these things, they are not bad by themselves. If they are used properly, if they are used for broadcasting the holy name of the Supreme Lord, chanting of the holy name, then that will be very, very effective.

Maharaj Parikshit was a realist. He knew perfectly well that in this age of Kali, auspicious things produce good effects immediately, whereas inauspicious acts must be actually performed to render effects. So he was never envious of the personality of Kali.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A person does not become a victim of a sinful activity until he actually performs that sinful activity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains a special facility in Kali Yuga: one is not affected by sinful reactions until the sinful act is actually performed, contrasting it with previous yugas.

This is a very important verse, which gives some practical guidance for us to understand what kind of evil influence does Kali have in this age on all of us. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, the age of Kali is called the fallen age. This is the age where the influence of the Kala, this particular Yuga, is the most evil influence compared to Sathya, Treta or Dwapara Yugas in the past. It's called the fallen age. In this fallen age, because the living beings are in an awkward position, the Supreme Lord has given them the power to do so. The Supreme Lord has given some special facilities to them. They are handicapped because of being in Kali Yuga, so the Supreme Lord has given some special facility. What is that? By the will of the Lord, a living entity does not become a victim of a sinful act until the act is actually performed. Please hear this carefully. A person is not a victim of a sinful act until the act is actually performed. Please hear this carefully. A person does not become a victim of a sinful activity until he actually performs that sinful activity. What does this mean? The next sentence will help you understand this better. In other ages, simply by thinking of performing a sinful act, one used to become a victim of the act. What does this mean? Supposing, in a previous Yuga, somebody thought of smoking a cigarette. Immediately, they become a victim of that sinful activity. They get sinful reaction simply for thinking of smoking. Now, Kali Yuga is such that if somebody thinks of smoking, they don't get any sinful reactions for thinking in a sinful way. They get the sinful reaction simply for thinking of smoking. The sinful reaction, only if they actually smoke, they actually perform the sinful activity.

**Key Quote:** "a living being in this age is awarded with the results of pious acts simply by thinking of them."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts sinful acts with pious acts in Kali Yuga, explaining that one can gain spiritual benefit simply by thinking of performing pious acts and reiterates Maharaj Parikshit's attitude towards Kali.

Now, in this same Kali Yuga, on the contrary, Prabhupada says, a living being in this age is awarded with the results of pious acts simply by thinking of them. Opposed to sinful activity, supposing I think of doing some worship of the Supreme Lord, I think of doing it, then simply by thinking I get some spiritual benefit of actually having performed. Simply by thinking you get the benefit. So this is the special facility the Supreme Lord has given us in this age of Kali because we are handicapped due to the influence of the age, evil influence of Kali. So therefore it is described about Maharaj Pariksit. Maharaj Pariksit, being the most learned and experienced King by the grace of the Lord, was not unnecessarily envious of the personality of Kali. See, personality of Kali is adharma bandhu, he spreads his evil influence, he wants to bring in irreligion in a place where there is no irreligion, so Kali is not a very welcome personality, but still...

**Key Quote:** "Pariksit Maharaj protected his subjects from falling prey to the sinful acts of the age of Kali and at the same time he gave full facility to the age of Kali by allotting him some particular places."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Maharaj Parikshit protected his citizens from the sinful influence of Kali while still allowing Kali certain places to reside.

a truly dikkat in the nakata of human nature, so Kali is a very polite and repentant and always engaging in good deeds. So Maharaj Pariksit was not unnecessarily envious of the personality of Kali. Why was he not envious? Because he did not intend to give him any chance to perform any sinful activity. Pariksit did not kill Kali Purusha, at the same time he did not allow Kali Purusha to remain in this kingdom and do his nefarious act of spreading his evil influence among innocent people. Poor Pariksit did not allow that. So it is further said by Srila Prabhupada, Pariksit Maharaj protected his subjects from falling prey to the sinful acts of the age of Kali and at the same time he gave full facility to the age of Kali by allotting him some particular places. He gave Kali Purusha some particular places, but he also protected the citizens from not performing the sinful activities. If somebody performs a sinful activity then they give Kali a place to reside and spread the evil influence among the people. So, it is trying to make it very easy for Kali to influence...

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of tuberculosis bacteria to explain how Kali spreads his influence and lists the five places where Kali resides: meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, and accumulating wealth.

it is just like supposing there is a tuberculosis bacteria. If somebody catches that infection of the tuberculosis bacteria, they get tuberculosis infection, then the tuberculosis bacteria sitting in the body of one person who is infected will spread to others while living and multiplying in the body of a healthy person. So if Kali is not given a chance to reside in this earth planet, where will Kali be able to reside? Wherever sinful activities like meat-eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex are going on, four places, and of course there is a fifth place also where gold is kept accumulated for sins gratification, five places Kali can come and reside and spread the evil influence of spreading irreligious activities. So to prevent Kali from spreading irreligious influence, evil influence, one should not give Kali a place to reside. That means there should be nobody who indulges in these five things, indulges in these five things: consuming intoxication, killing animals for meat-eating and gambling, indulging in illicit sex and keeping wealth for sins gratification. So these five things if we avoid...

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the great advantage of Kali Yuga: one can attain liberation simply by chanting Hare Krishna, and mentions Maharaj Parikshit's efforts to propagate this chanting.

then Kali will have no place to reside and spread this evil influence. So it is further told by Srila Prabhupada in the purport, at the end of the Srimad Bhagavatam, it is said that even though all nefarious activities of the personality of Kali are present, there is a great advantage in the age of Kali: one can attain salvation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Bhagavatam particularly says this. Bhagavatam is a special scripture for this Kali Yuga and Bhagavatam says simply by chanting Hare Krishna, one can attain ultimate liberation from material bondage. Thus Maharaja Pariksit made an organized effort to propagate the chanting of the Lord's holy name and thus he saved the citizens from the clutches of Kali, exactly what Srila Prabhupada has done, has done or is still doing through his sincere followers. Prabhupada's movement, Krishna conscious movement, Hare Krishna movement is a movement of life, wisdom, self-respect. This con movement is meant for spreading the chanting of the holy name of the Supreme Lord Krishna, the Hare Krishna mantra, so that Kali cannot exert his influence. Kali cannot spread his evil influence. And everyone can be saved simply by this propaganda of chanting Hare Krishna. It is only for this reason that sages sometimes wish all good for the age of Kali. On the one side it is said Kali Yuga is a dangerous age, because the influence of Kali people become very sinful. But another statement is also there, Kali Yuga is a very, very special age, where simply by chanting Hare Krishna, one can drive away the evil influence of Kali, one is protected completely by chanting Hare Krishna, and one is also able to achieve ultimate liberation simply by chanting. The example of Ajamila given in the sixth canto of Bhagavatam explains in detail this particular special facility in Kali Yuga.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of Krishna Katha and the role of a Vaishnava in protecting innocent people from negative influences.

In the Vedas also it is said that by discourse on Lord Krishna's activities, one can get rid of all the disadvantages of the age of Kali. In the beginning of the Srimad Bhagavatam, it is also said that by the recitation of Srimad Bhagavatam, the Supreme Lord becomes at once arrested within one's heart. The Supreme Lord is present in everyone's heart as Paramatma, but if we engage in hearing Krishna Katha, the Supreme Lord becomes active in our heart and then he protects us from the evil influence of Kali. These are some of the great advantages of the age of Kali and Maharaj Parikshit took all the advantages and did not think any ill of the age of Kali. True to his Vaishnavite cult, a Vaishnava is compassionate upon all the living beings, but a Vaishnava never allows a sinful living entity to influence other innocent people in a negative way. One sinful person should not influence other innocent people to...

**Key Quote:** "The king was powerful like a tiger and took care of the foolish careless persons."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the eighth verse of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Maharaj Parikshit's role in protecting his kingdom and the influence of Kali.

In this session, we will be discussing verses 8, 9, and 10 of the 18th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So, first, verse number 8: Kimnu Baleshu Surena Kalina Dheera Bhiruna Apramatta Pramateshu Yovruko Nrushu Vartate. The meaning of this eighth verse: Maharaj Parikshit considered that less intelligent men might find the personality of Kali to be very powerful, but those who are self-controlled would have nothing to fear. The king was powerful like a tiger and took care of the foolish, careless persons. So, a very important description of the protection given by Parikshit Maharaj to the people of his kingdom.

**Key Quote:** "One who is a devotee of Krishna is actually very intelligent."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of spiritual intelligence versus material intelligence, emphasizing that true intelligence lies in devotion to Krishna and understanding God.

The purport to the Prabhupada says, those who are not devotees of the Lord are careless and unintelligent. Why is this said? Because unless one is thoroughly intelligent, one cannot be a devotee of the Lord. Ye Krishna bhaje sei bada chatura, the statement of Chaitanya Charitamrita. One who is a devotee of Krishna is actually very intelligent. So, only an intelligent person takes to devotional service. This intelligence is not ordinary material intelligence. It is actually spiritual intelligence. Spiritual intelligence is a little different. What is spiritual intelligence? How is it different from material intelligence? Material intelligence is to be able to use one's intelligence for eating, sleeping, mating, defending, defending for sense satisfaction, for some bodily meeting bodily demands. That intelligence even the animals have, the birds have, all creatures have. That intelligence is not being talked of here. The intelligence to actually try to understand God, try to understand what is spirit, engage in spiritual activities for eternal benefit, ultimate welfare, that is spiritual intelligence, and that is different. That is not necessarily connected with the material intelligence.

**Key Quote:** "If we want people to be protected against evil influence of Kali then we have to propagate this devotional service among the common people."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the negative influence of Kali on those who are not devotees and stresses the importance of propagating devotional service to protect people from sinful activities.

So, those who are not devotees of the Lord fall prey to the actions of Kali. Kali can influence somebody who is not a devotee. What will be Kali's influence like? They will be enticed into engaging in sinful activities like meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, or earn a lot of money for sense gratification. These are all the evil influence of Kali on unintelligent people. And who are these unintelligent people? They are basically not devotees of Krishna. It will not be possible to bring about a saner condition in society unless we are prepared to accept the modes of action adopted by Maharaj Pariksit, that is, propagation of the devotional service of the Lord to the common man. So, in this society, if we want to avoid Kali's influence, if we want people to be protected, then we have to propagate this devotional service among the common people. That is absolutely essential if at all we want to drive away Kali or keep people protected against the evil influence of Kali.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the ninth verse, explaining Suta Goswami's narration about Lord Krishna in connection with the history of Maharaj Parikshit to the sages of Naimisaranya.

Mata-Bhagavatam. The ninth verse: Upavaranyitam etad vah Punyam Pariksitam Maya Vasudeva Kathopetam Aakhyanam yad aprichathah. The meaning of this ninth verse is: O sages, as you did ask me, now I have described almost everything regarding the narration about Lord Krishna in connection with the history of the pious Maharaj Parikshit. This has got reference to Suta Goswami being selected as the president of the assembly where the sages of Naimsharanya are assembled to perform a thousand year sacrifice. So, the sages requested Suta Goswami to speak about Krishna katha. So, when Suta Goswami saw the eagerness of the sage Naimsharanya to hear about Krishna, he told them, "Now I shall recite the Srimad Bhagavatam because you are eager to hear about Krishna." But the sages said, "Before you begin this reciting Srimad Bhagavatam, kindly tell us something more about Pariksit Maharaj."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is never alone, Krishna performs his pastimes in relationship with his devotees"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Srimad Bhagavatam contains descriptions of both the activities of the Lord and the activities of His pure devotees, emphasizing that Krishna is always with his devotees.

So, that is completed by Suta Goswami at this juncture. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Srimad Bhagavatam is history of the activities of the Lord, and the activities of the Lord are performed in relation with the devotees of the Lord. Therefore, the history of the devotees is not different from the history of Lord Krishna's activities. So, Bhagavatam contains a description of the activities of the Supreme Lord in his various incarnations, but Bhagavatam also contains a description of the activities of the pure devotees of the Lord in their relationship with the Lord. When Krishna descends, Krishna comes with his pure devotees. Those pure devotees also perform activities, just like the description is there of Sudama Vipra, Sudama Brahman. So, his activities, his devotion, his visiting Krishna, his mode of living, all that is described, and that is also Krishna katha. Anything in relationship with Krishna, a devotee, the Lord regards both the activities of the Lord and those of his pure devotees on an equal level, for they are all transcendental. Sometimes foolishly people think, "Why should I hear about some devotee's history? I don't want to hear. I want to hear about Krishna only." But such foolish people don't understand Krishna is never alone. Krishna performs his pastimes in relationship with his devotees. Krishna is always with his devotees, especially Krishna is always with his

So, we should hear topics connected with the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead because he's always with his devotees. In a purport, Srila Prabhupada says, the systematic hearing of the transcendental activities, qualities, and names of Lord Sri Krishna pushes one towards eternal life. This is described elsewhere in the Bhagavatam. Here in the first chapter, in the first canto, in the second canto, this is described. You should make a program to systematically hear the Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is a very big scripture, 18,000 verses. But hear little by little by little every day. And what will happen if you hear every day? It is said here that you go on hearing, hearing, hearing Bhagavath Shravan. Hearing Srimad Bhagavatam every day. Prabhupada instituted the system of having a Bhagavatam discourse every day in the temple. And if you cannot come to the temple, you can watch the Bhagavatam discourse on the channel, on the broadcast channel. You can hear the Bhagavatam discourse. So, systematic hearing. Every day you hear, little, little, little, little. And if you cannot hear at the time the class is conducted, because morning you may be busy, class happens in the morning, then you can hear later in the day or in the evening. And you can hear the Bhagavatam discourse. You are hearing the same discourse. It is stored. So, by simply hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, you are progressing towards eternal life.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Chai Vanarottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session we will be discussing from three verses, verse numbers 1, 2 and 3 of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We are beginning a new chapter. This 19th chapter of the first canto is entitled The Appearance of Shukadeva Goswami. This is text number 1. The meaning of this verse is: Shri Suta Goswami said, "While returning home, the king Maharaj Pariksha felt that the act he had committed against the faultlessness of the king was not right. The powerful brahmana was heinous and uncivilized. Consequently, he was distressed. The pious king regretted his accidental improper treatment of the powerful brahmana who was faultless. Such repentance is natural for a good man like the king, and such repentance delivers a devoted heart. The devotees are naturally faultless. Accidental sins committed by a devotee are sincerely regretted, and by the grace of the Lord, all sins unwittingly committed by a devotee are burnt in the fire of repentance." So essentially, Srila Prabhupada is telling that Pariksit, being a pure devotee, is naturally faultless, but accidentally he committed a mistake, and he was very, very repentant about it. So in the fire of repentance, such sinful reactions are burnt away.

Now what are the injunctions of the Supreme Lord? That is explained in the purport, which we will just read. And because of that, he definitely is expecting to face some problem, some difficulty. Now he also is desiring that let that calamity happen now. Why? Because he will be then freed from that sinful action, and it will also be a lesson for him that he will never again commit such an offense. So this is sincere repentance by Pariksit,

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord enjoins that Brahmanas and cows must be given all protection."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the importance of protecting Brahmanas and cows, the impartiality of God's laws, and how a devotee's actions affect their family, emphasizing the responsibility of a devotee.

In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The Supreme Lord enjoins that Brahmanas and cows must be given all protection. The Lord is himself very much inclined to do good to Brahmanas and cows. go brāhmaṇa hitāya ca." There is one prayer to Krishna: namo brahmaṇya devāya go brāhmaṇa hitāya ca jagadhitāya kṛṣṇaya govindāya namo namah. So in this prayer to Krishna, it is clearly declared that Krishna is very much inclined, go brāhmaṇa hitāya ca, for the welfare of go brāhmaṇa, cows and the brāhmaṇas. Maharaj Pariksit knew all this and thus he concluded that his insulting a powerful brāhmaṇa was certainly to be punished by the laws of the Lord. Laws of nature are the laws of God, and they operate in this material world very impartially, very strictly. Nobody can escape them. Somebody may escape the laws of the government, but nobody can escape the laws of God or laws of nature. And it is said further, he was expecting something very difficult in the very near future. He therefore desired the imminent calamity to fall on him and not on his family members. Why is this? Because it is said here, a man's personal misconduct affects all his family members. Therefore Maharaj Pariksit desired the calamity to fall on him alone, not on his family members. By suffering personally, he would be restrained from future sins, and at the same time, the sin which he had committed would be counteracted so that his descendants would not suffer. That is the way a responsible devotee thinks, very, very disciplined in thinking, speaking and acting. Through mind, through words, and through the body, we act three ways. So all of them are very regulated, restrained in the case of a devotee, a responsible devotee. The family members of a devotee also share the effects of a devotee's service to the Lord. Example is given by Srila Prabhupada, Maharaj Prahlad saved his demon father by his personal devotional service. A devotee's son in the family is the greatest boon.

**Key Quote:** "Progressive human civilization is based on Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and protection of cows."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection as the foundation for progressive human civilization and how economic development is useless without these principles.

The third verse, adyaiva rājyaṁ balamṛddha-kōśam prakopita brahma kulānalome dahatu abhadrasya unarna me abhūt pāpīya sīdhir dvijadeva gobhyahā. The meaning of this third verse is, "I am uncivilized and sinful due to my neglect of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection. Therefore I wish that my kingdom, strength and riches burn up immediately by the fire of the Brahman's wrath so that in the future I may not be guided by such inauspicious attitudes." So this is another description in the Bhagavatam, in this chapter, that Pariksit was very, very, very repentant about the mistake he had done, and he wants the reaction to come immediately now. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, progressive human civilization is based on Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and protection of cows. dvijadeva gobhyahā. This is the Sanskrit that is used in this verse. vijā refers to the Brahmanical culture, deva refers to God consciousness, gobhyahā refers to protection of cows. All economic development of the state by trade, commerce, agriculture and industries must be fully utilized in relation to the above principles, the principles of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection. Otherwise, all so-called economic development becomes a source of degradation. If economic development does not actually result in taking care of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection, then such economic development is useless.

**Key Quote:** "The age of Kali aims at killing the higher principles of life."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how cow protection leads to God consciousness and the perfection of human civilization, the negative influence of Kali Yuga, and the importance of engaging wealth and strength in advancing Brahmanical culture and God consciousness.

Human society will not make real progress without such principles being adhered to. Cow protection means feeding the Brahmanical culture, which leads towards God consciousness, and thus, the perfection of human civilization is achieved. The age of Kali aims at killing the higher principles of life. Kali Yuga is an age in which the influence of Kali promotes irreligion. Kali is called adharma bandhu. Kali influence spreads irreligion. The influence of Kali is the same throughout the state. Therefore, the age of Kali aims at killing the higher principles of life. Although Maharaj Pariksit strongly resisted the domination of the personality of Kali within the world, the influence of the age of Kali came at an opportune moment, and even a strong king like Maharaj Pariksit was induced to disregard the Brahmanical culture due to a slight provocation of hunger and thirst. How did Maharaj Pariksit commit this mistake? He was extremely thirsty and hungry. Now, such hunger and thirst is not difficult to tolerate for a great soul like Maharaj Pariksit, but somehow, it so happened that he did commit this mistake while he was thirsty and tired and looking for drinking water. Maharaj Pariksit lamented the accidental incident and he desired that all his kingdom strength and accumulation of wealth would be burned up for not being engaged in Brahmanical culture, etc. He wanted punishment, and that punishment also, should be such that he learns a lesson, he does not commit a similar mistake in the future, and also, the sin is counteracted so that the future generations of his family are not affected. So, considering all this, he wanted that immediately, he get the reaction. So, Srila Prabhupada says, the lesson for us is, where wealth and strength are not engaged in the advancement of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and God protection, the state and home are surely doomed.

Providence here means the laws of nature, the laws of God. If we want peace and prosperity in the world, we should take lessons from these words. Every state and every home must endeavor to advance the cause of Brahmanical culture for self-purification, God consciousness for self-realization, and God protection for getting sufficient milk and the best food to continue a perfect civilization. This is the conclusion by Srila Prabhupada. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Generally you, the sages, consider royalty as refuse to be rejected and left in a distant place.' So these are the first words spoken by Pariksit Maharaj after receiving the great saintly persons, all categories of great sages, by bowing down and standing up with folded hands and telling them of his decision to fast until death. Then he is telling that the appearance of all those great saintly persons itself is indication that Pariksit Maharaj is the greatest saintly person who has ever been worshipped as a saintly person. He is very, very fortunate.

**Summary:** The speaker explains why saintly persons are independent of worldly power and wealth, quoting Srila Prabhupada and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on the dangers of associating with materialistic people for those seeking spiritual advancement.

To be able to get such wonderful association at the last stage of his quitting the body in the association of great saintly persons, because such great souls, they have no respect for great kings who are powerful and have great personalities, who have great courage in fighting in battle and who wield power and rule over citizens. They are independent. Saintly persons are independent of all such Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and other greats of people. So why does Pariksit say that sages consider royalty as refuse to be rejected and left in a distant place? So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport. Prabhupada says, 'According to religious principles, stool, urine, wash water, etc., must be left at a long distance.' Formerly, the toilets, etc., were built or placed very far away from the living quarters because all such refuse garbage has to be discarded at a long distance, far away from where we live in a clean atmosphere. Attached bathrooms used to be... is cited herein in relation to the kingly order for those who are progressively marching back to Godhead. So, if you are serious about going back to Godhead, you should not associate too much with worldly-minded people. And Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said that to be in intimate touch with dollars and cents men or the kingly order is worse than suicide.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of renunciation and sense control for spiritual progress, quoting Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on the dangers of even glancing at objects of sense gratification.

for one who desires to go back to Godhead. What does Chaitanya Mahaprabhu say? Nishkinchanasyabhagavadbhajanonmukhasyaparamparamjigamishorbhavasagarasya. If one is a saintly person, nishkinchana means he is a renunciant, he has given up all material possessions and he is engaged in bhagavadbhajana, in devotional service to Krishna.

You cannot expect that you will cross over the ocean by swimming, by your own endeavour, independent endeavour. No. So material existence is not easy to cross over. It is compared to an ocean. So many obstacles and difficulties are there in crossing over this material existence. So such a person, a serious person, a serious transcendentalist, for him, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, sandarshanam vishainam atha yoshitam ca, merely glancing, sandarshanam vishainam sense enjoyers, or objects of sense gratification, vishainam atha yoshitam ca, ha hantahant vishabhakshanato pya sadhu, is worse than willingly drinking poison. So it is very, very important. So, it is very, very dangerous for a saintly person, who has renounced all material facilities and comforts, to even look at sense gratifiers or objects of sense enjoyment. So, this is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's instruction.

**Key Quote:** "This material world is a perverted reflection of the spiritual world."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the material world is an illusion, a reflection of the spiritual world, and that true spiritual knowledge leads to detachment from material attractions.

So, this is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's instruction. not generally associate with men who are too enamored by the external beauty of God's creation. Whatever material beauty that is actually the creation of the illusory energy meant for those who want to enjoy materially and thereby become entangled in material existence and continue the repetition of birth and death, whereas transcendentalists give up all illusory sense objects, objects of sense gratification and also don't associate with sense enjoyers. By advanced knowledge in spiritual realization, the transcendentalist knows that there is nothing but a shadowy reflection of the reality, the kingdom of God. This is very clearly explained in the 15th chapter. This material world is a perverted reflection of the spiritual world. Reflection means the object which is reflected and seen as a reflection. That object is the real reality. Reflection is not the reality, it is a shadow of the reality. So, if you are interested in reality. If you have a material world, which is the kingdom of God, then this material world, however nice it may appear or however nice it may be promising, it actually is nothing other than a reflection or a shadow. It means there is no substance in trying to enjoy materially. So, a transcendentalist who has got advanced knowledge in spiritual realization knows this fact, has realized this fact and therefore such transcendentalists are not very much captivated by royal opulence or anything like that.

**Key Quote:** "realized knowledge, jnana has to become vijnana, then vijnana means one is able to practice, one is able to follow, one is able to act on the platform of that knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the process of spiritual realization, from hearing to internalizing knowledge, and clarifies that Pariksit Maharaj's situation was unique, as he was being called back to Godhead by Krishna.

They are not attracted by the palace in which a king may stay, the comfortable facilities a very rich man may have for his bodily comforts, for his enjoyment, for his happiness, material happiness. A transcendentalist is never attracted by any of those things. This is not possible, only if there is realization of the knowledge. First of all one has to hear from the proper authority, spiritual authority. And then one has to internalize that, what has been heard and digest that information, that knowledge. realized knowledge, jnana has to become vijnana, then vijnana means one is able to practice, one is able to follow, one is able to act on the platform of that knowledge. Now here Srila Prabhupada says about Pariksit Maharaj, but in the case of Pariksit Maharaj the situation was different. Apparently the king was condemned to death by an inexperienced brahmana boy. So it appears like when the king was cursed, oh he had insulted the sage, therefore the sage Shamika Rishi, his Shamika Rishi's son Sringi, a powerful brahmana boy condemned him. King Pariksit to die within seven days by snake bite, so somebody may think that the king is a very ordinary person in spiritual terms, he is very ordinary person, he is foolishly acted by insulting a great saintly person, a great sage, but no. Prabhupada clarifies, don't mistake Pariksit to be an ordinary worldly person. But factually Pariksit was called by the Lord to return to him, to return to God. So it is Krishna's arrangement for Pariksit to return back to godhead immediately.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by highlighting the importance of devotional service and the association of devotees, explaining why great sages were eager to associate with Pariksit Maharaj, a descendant of the Pandavas.

So, Prabhupada says further, other transcendentalists, the great sages and mystics who assembled together because of Maharaj Parikshit's fasting unto death, were quite anxious to see him for he was going back to Godhead. Why did these great sages come there? They knew that Parikshit is not an ordinary king, he is a pure devotee and he is ready to go back to Godhead. Let us associate with him. Maharaj Parikshit could also understand that the great sages who assembled there were all kind to his forefathers, the Pandavas, because of their devotional service to the Lord. See, devotional service is the topmost spiritual practice and great devotees are recognized by advanced transcendentalists as the topmost transcendentalists in the material world. So, Pandavas were respected like that and Parikshit Maharaj was a descendant of the Pandavas. Therefore, he was very happy to actually receive the great sages and have their association at the last moment of his life.

### humility, surrender, detachment, mercy of the Lord

**Key Quote:** "A devotee is fully surrendered to Krishna, and his life is in Krishna's hands. So he considers anything that happens, good or bad in his life, materially good or bad, to be the mercy of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Pariksit Maharaj's humble acceptance of the brahmana's curse as the Lord's mercy, highlighting the devotee's surrender and detachment from material attachments.

In this session we will be discussing two verses, the fourteenth and the fifteenth verses of the nineteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the fourteenth verse is as follows: तस्यैवमे अगस्य परावरेशो व्यासक्त चित्तस्य ग्रहेश्व भीक्षनं निर्वेदमूलो विजशापरूपो यत्रप्रसक्तो भयमाशुधत्ते. The meaning of this fourteenth verse is: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the controller of both the transcendental and mundane worlds, has graciously overtaken me in the form of a Brahmana's curse. Due to my being too much attached to family life, the Lord, in order to save me, has appeared before me in such a way that only out of fear I will detach myself from the world. So what is Pariksit telling? That he considers himself to be an attached householder. He is taking a humble position as a pure devotee. Pure devotees are always very, very humble. Even though they are the most advanced transcendentalists, they don't consider themselves as very advanced. So they are careful not to become proud, not to be arrogant, not to offend others. Pariksit is taking, especially in front of the saintly persons who have all assembled there, a very humble position: that I am too much attached to family life. I was living in a comfortable palace. I was surrounded by so much wealth, power, comforts. So in order to make me detached from this world, the Supreme Lord has appeared before me in the form of a brahmana's curse to die within seven days. So this is the nature of a devotee. A devotee is fully surrendered, a pure devotee especially, is fully surrendered to Krishna, and his life is in Krishna's hands. So he considers anything that happens, good or bad in his life, materially good or bad, to be the mercy of the Supreme Lord. This is explained in the Bhagavatam, 10th canto, 14th chapter, in the prayers of Lord Brahma to Krishna: Tattenu Kampam Susamiksha Mano Bhunjana Evatmakrita Vipakam. My dear Lord, it is only your mercy that I am facing some material difficulties or some material miseries because actually I deserve to suffer much, much, much, much more due to my own past misdeeds. But you are so kind to your devotee that you have reduced that suffering that I have to undergo to the minimum as a token to encourage me in my devotional service, and that is only because of your causeless mercy upon me. So this is the attitude of a devotee when the devotee faces some difficulty or some calamity or some danger or some misery. He never blames the Lord, but rather he considers that difficulty to be the Lord's mercy upon him, and as a result of that, the devotee becomes detached from everything material, becomes completely detached.

**Key Quote:** "Such direct action is taken by the Lord in the case of a special devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's explanation of Pariksit Maharaj's situation, emphasizing that the Lord directly intervenes in the lives of special devotees to detach them from material life, using Prabhupada's own life as an example.

100% detached. In the Purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Pariksit, although born in a family of great devotees, the Pandavas, and although securely trained in transcendental attachment for the association of the Lord, still found the allurement of mundane family life so strong that he had to be detached by a plan of the Lord. Now, Pariksit is no ordinary king. He has appeared in the family of great devotees, pure devotees, the Pandavas, and the Pandavas have trained him in spiritual practice because of which he has developed transcendental attachment for Krishna. In spite of that, he considers family attachment as very, very strong. It is so strong that he had to be detached by a plan of the Lord. Now, Prabhupada explains, such direct action is taken by the Lord in the case of a special devotee. Lord does not intervene in the lives of everyone. Only in the lives of very, very, very great devotees the Lord intervenes. Srila Prabhupada explains, in his own life, he was doing business to maintain his family, but he was an ideal grihasta. He was very strictly practicing Krishna consciousness and he was following the instructions of his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. But, when Prabhupada faced a lot of difficulties in running his business, he underwent heavy losses, so much so that he had to wind up his business, close down his business and leave home and go away to Vrindavan. So, he considered that it was Krishna's special blessing upon him that he faced those great losses, that he was forced by Krishna to give up his family, give up the business, engagement, and fully dedicate himself exclusively for spiritual life. Similarly, Pariksit considers that this Brahmana's curse is an arrangement of the Supreme Lord. It's a direct action taken by the Lord

**Key Quote:** "The Lord resides with his devotees and therefore, the presence of the great saintly persons indicated the presence of the Lord."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains that Pariksit Maharaj understood the Lord's favor through the presence of great saintly persons, emphasizing that their presence signifies the Lord's presence and facilitates spiritual advancement, before beginning to explain the 15th verse.

because of Lord's mercy on Pariksit. Maharaj Pariksit could understand this by the presence of the topmost transcendentalists in the universe. However, assembled sages are no ordinary persons. The topmost transcendentalists in the universe, they have come to the earth planet. So, the Lord resides with his devotees and therefore, the presence of the great saintly persons indicated the presence of the Lord. Why? Why is it like that? Because these great saintly persons carry the Lord within their heart. They carry the Lord within their heart. So, their presence is the same as the presence of the Supreme Lord himself. The king, therefore, welcomed the presence of the great rishis as a mark of favor of the Supreme Lord. So, Krishna is favoring Pariksit by arranging the topmost transcendentalists to that holy place so that Pariksit could get their association during the last stage of his life in this material world in order to perfectly prepare himself to go back to Godhead. The 15th verse: tamopayatam pratiyantu vipra gangachadevi dhrtachittamise dhijopasrishtah kuhakas takshakova dashatu alam gayata vishnugathah. The meaning of this 15th verse is: O brahmanas, just accept me as a completely surrendered soul and let Mother Ganges, the representative of the Lord, also accept me in that way. For, I have already taken the lotus feet of the Lord into my heart. Let the snake bird or whatever magical thing the brahmana created bite me at once. I only desire that you all continue singing the deeds of Lord Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "So this is the right attitude for a perfect devotee who is properly prepared to go back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Pariksit Maharaj's prayer for complete surrender to the brahmanas and Mother Ganga, highlighting his desire for purification and immersion in the glories of Lord Vishnu even at the moment of death.

So this is the right attitude for a perfect devotee who is properly prepared to go back to Godhead. That Parikshit is sitting there in the holy place on the bank of the river Ganga in the association of great saintly persons, that he is praying to them, accept me as a completely surrendered soul. Surrender does not mean only surrender to Krishna. Surrender means surrender to God, surrender to Krishna, surrender to the spiritual master, surrender to the Vaishnavas, surrender to the saintly persons. So this is surrender, perfect surrender. And he is also praying, let Mother Ganges, the representative of the Lord, also accept me in that way. That means he is surrendered even to Mother Ganga. Mother Ganga is especially carrying the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, so she purifies whoever comes in contact with her. So Parikshit wants to be completely purified in preparation for going back to Godhead. So therefore he is praying to Mother Ganga also, please accept me as a surrendered soul and purify me. And also he is telling he has taken the lotus feet of the Lord into his heart. He is not afraid of death due to the snake bite which is the Brahmana's curse because he is firmly situated in Krishna consciousness. Of course he is requesting the saintly persons to sing the deeds of Lord Vishnu, Vishnugatha, so he will be immersed in hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord even at the last moment of his life in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "This freedom from fear of death is a very very important point."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami concludes by emphasizing the importance of freedom from the fear of death, which is achieved through complete surrender to the Lord and the creation of a spiritual atmosphere in the association of devotees.

The purport, Srila Prabhupada says, as soon as one is given up completely unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, he is not at all afraid of death. The atmosphere created by the presence of great devotees of the Lord on the bank of the Ganges and Maharaj Pariksit's complete acceptance of the Lord's lotus feet was sufficient guarantee to the King for going back to Godhead. See, when devotees are present they create a completely spiritual atmosphere and in such a spiritual atmosphere one can be perfectly situated in Krishna consciousness. An aspiring transcendentalist or even a devotee who is prepared to go back to Godhead cannot get a better atmosphere than this: the association of topmost transcendentalists in the universe and Pariksit Maharaj has also accepted the Lord's lotus feet in his heart. So these are guaranteed for the King to go back to Godhead. And in this way, Srila Prabhupada says, he became absolutely free from all fear of death. This freedom from fear of death is a very, very important point. It is only because of the fear of death, and when actually death comes we are so afraid, that we are completely bewildered in what we should do when we have to quit the body. We try to take steps to take some material shelter or some material remedy or some material attachment. All these things bewilder a conditioned soul when quitting the body at the time of death. It is a very fearful moment, but for a pure devotee it is not at all fearful. It is completely free from fear of death. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "if at all he takes birth again in the material world, he desires three things."
**Summary:** Pariksit Maharaj expresses his desires for his next life, focusing on attachment to Krishna, association with devotees, and friendly relations with all beings.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 16th and the 17th verses of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavata. The 16th verse is as follows: Punashya Bhuvyad Bhagavatyanante Ratiprasangascha Tad Ashrayeshu Mahatsuyamyam Upayami Srishtim Maitriyastu Sarvatra Namo Dvijayabhyaha. The meaning of this verse is, "Again offering obeisances unto all you brahmanas, I pray that if I should again take my birth in the material world, I will have complete attachment to the unlimited Lord Krishna, association with his devotees, and friendly relations with all living beings." So, Pariksit is speaking to the assembled sages. Great sages, great saintly personalities from all the universe have assembled there to witness Pariksit quitting his body because Pariksit is a pure devotee. Therefore, they come to witness that event, but Pariksit is taking a humble position, and he offers his obeisances to all the brahmanas assembled there, and he prays that if at all he takes birth again in the material world, he desires three things. What are the three things? One is that he will have complete attachment to the unlimited Lord Krishna. The second thing he desires is association with Krishna's devotees. And the third thing he desires is friendly relation with all living beings.

**Key Quote:** "a devotee of the Lord is no one's enemy, although there may be many enemies of a devotee."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada's explanation of the qualities of a devotee, emphasizing their lack of enemies, preference for devotee association, and attachment to Krishna.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains these three points in the purport. Srila Prabhupada says that a devotee of the Lord is the only perfect living being explained herein by Maharaj Pariksit. Of all the different categories of people in this world, material world, the devotee is the only perfect living being. Why? Because of certain qualifications. Srila Prabhupada says, a devotee of the Lord is no one's enemy, although there may be many enemies of a devotee. What does this mean? Yudhishthira had no enemy. He had no enmity with anybody, including Duryodhana. But Duryodhana considered Yudhishthira Maharaj as his enemy. So, this is the position of a devotee. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, a devotee of the Lord does not like to associate with non-devotees, although he has no enmity with them. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, the characteristic of a Vaishnava is asatsangatyag-e-Vaishnava-achar. So, one category of a devotee. Asat means those who are materially attached. One category of asat is non-devotee, Krishna-abhakta. And another category of asat is strisangi, those who are simply attached to objects of sense gratification, strisangi. So, a devotee does not like to associate with non-devotees. He always wants association of other devotees. So, Srila Prabhupada says further, he desires, that is, a devotee desires association with the devotees of the Lord. This is perfectly natural because birds of the same feather mix together. Naturally, a devotee is inclined to do devotional service, hear about and glorify the Supreme Lord always. So, he would like to be in the association of other like-minded persons who are devotees like him. And the most important function of a devotee is to have complete attachment for Lord Shri Krishna, the father of all living beings. A devotee perfectly understands Krishna is the supreme father of everyone.

**Key Quote:** "It's insanity to forget Krishna, to be independent of Krishna, to disobey Krishna's instructions. It's insane."
**Summary:** The devotee's perspective on all living beings as children of Krishna, the importance of bringing others to Krishna consciousness, and the value of association with devotees regardless of material status.

As a good son of the father behaves in a friendly way with all his other brothers, so also the devotee of the Lord, being a good son of the Supreme Father Lord Krishna, sees all other living beings in relation with the Supreme Father. Why is it that a devotee has no enmity with anyone? Because he sees everyone, irrespective of their present condition. Everyone is part and parcel of Krishna. Everyone is a good son of the Supreme Lord Krishna. But presently, some of them are forgetful of Krishna. He tries to bring back the upstart sons of the father to a saner stage. It's insanity to forget Krishna, to be independent of Krishna, to disobey Krishna's instructions. It's insane. So, a devotee preaches in such a way that somebody may become sane. And also his preaching is meant to get them to accept the supreme fatherhood of God. Maharaj Pariksit was certainly going back to Godhead. But even if he were not to go back, he prayed for a pattern of life, which is the most perfect way in the material world. How to live in this world perfectly, if at all somebody wants to live like a devotee. So, Srila Prabhupada says, "A pure devotee does not desire the company of a personality as great as Brahma, but he prefers the association of a petty living being, provided that petty living being is a devotee of the Lord." So, a devotee desires association of other devotees. Now, the other devotees' material position doesn't matter. That's not important. Just important is the fact that they are devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Facing the north is still more favorable for attaining spiritual success."
**Summary:** Explanation of the 17th verse, detailing Pariksit Maharaj's preparations for leaving his body, including renunciation, auspicious arrangements, and facing the north for spiritual success.

The seventeenth verse: Itismaraja adhyavasayayuktaha Prachinamuleshu Deshu dhiraha Udanmukho dakshina koola aaste Samudra patnya swasuta niyasta bhara ha. The meaning of this seventeenth verse is, "In perfect self-control, Maharaj Pariksit sat down on a seat of straw, with straw roots facing the east, placed on the southern bank of the Ganges, and he himself faced the north. Just previously, he had given charge of his kingdom over to his son." This means Pariksit completely renounced all connections with his wealth, with his family, with his possessions, everything. But, responsibly, he did hand over charge of ruling the world to his worthy son. So, in the Patpotshila, Prabhupada says, "The river Ganges is celebrated as the wife of the sea." This is a description in the scriptures. The river always goes and joins the sea. The river flows from where it starts, and goes on flowing, flowing, flowing, till it joins the sea. So, in that sense, the river Ganga is celebrated as the wife of the sea. Here, Samudra Patnya, that is referring to the Ganges, the wife of the sea. The seat of Kusha's straw is considered to be sanctified if the straw is taken out of the earth complete with root, and the root is pointed toward the east, it is considered to be auspicious. That means Pariksit is preparing himself to go back to Godhead with all auspicious conditions, favoring his going back to Godhead. Facing the north is still more favorable for attaining spiritual success. Though, as a pure devotee, he is not dependent on all these arrangements, but taking a humble position,

**Summary:** Discussion of the Vedic varnashrama system, the roles of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Pariksit Maharaj's responsible transfer of power to his son.

he adopts all the necessities required for going back to Godhead. Maharaj Pariksit handed over the charge of administration to his son before leaving home. You see, the Vedic culture, the Varnashrama system, the administration is carried out by the Kshatriyas, qualified Kshatriyas. The Brahmanas are intelligent persons who are learned in the scriptures, but they don't occupy the post of the administrator or the king. They give guidance to everyone else in the society, including the king, the Kshatriyas, the Vaishyas, the Shudras, everyone, for their spiritual success in life, and also guides them in maintaining themselves by appropriately carrying out some occupational activities. So, Brahmana is the perfect guide for everyone in the society. The Kshatriyas are meant to do administration. So, Pariksit Maharaj is ruling perfectly. When he was given charge by Yudhishthira, his grandfather, when the Pandavas retired timely, they handed over charge to Pariksit. They had trained up Pariksit before they could hand over charge. Similarly, Pariksit had trained his son Janamejaya, and Janamejaya took charge after Pariksit retired, renouncing the kingdom. So, Srila Prabhupada concludes by telling, Pariksit was thus fully equipped for all favorable conditions in order to go back to Godhead. That is the ultimate success of the human form of life, that one may simply aim to go back to Godhead after quitting the present body.

to fast until death and prepare himself to quit his body in order to go back to Godhead. So, the devatas took note of this because he is such a great personality, famous throughout the universe because of his being a pure devotee. So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Even up to the time of Maharaj Pariksit, there were interplanetary communications. And the news of Maharaj Pariksit's fasting unto death to attain salvation reached the higher planets in the sky where the intelligent demigods live. See, Prabhupada is telling us in the upper planets there are more intelligent beings than the humans on the earth. Modern day people tend to think that all other planets are vacant and there is life only on this earth planet. But that is completely wrong. There are living beings on every planet of this creation. And there are living beings even in the spiritual planets.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of life in a desert to illustrate that life exists in various forms adapted to different environments, including the sun planet and aquatic environments.

What to speak of other planets even in this desert area of this earth planet. There may seem to be only vast expanse of some sand. But that is the uninformed ignorant foolish people who think like that there is no life. But there are so many living creatures who are adapted to live there. It is like even in a desert there are some vegetation like there are date trees. There are cactus which grow. And buried in the sand there are so many crawling insects. Some varieties of worms. So naked eye cannot see them. So therefore somebody may wrongly conclude that there is no life. But actually every type of atmosphere supports life in its own way. Just like Srila Prabhupada informs us. Even in the sun planet there are living beings with bodies made of fire. In the water there are so many aquatics. They have bodies suitable for living in water. We are terrestrial beings. We are meant to live on the land. We cannot live in the sea, like the aquatics. The aquatics cannot live on the land. You bring a fish out of water and place him on the land. He will not survive for long. So similarly if this atmosphere on the land is suitable for us.

**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe different types of living beings and their corresponding bodies, emphasizing the superior qualities of the demigods, including their intelligence, piety, and devotion to the Supreme Lord.

Like there are so many germs that are living in the air. They live in the air. There are some living beings living in the sky. That we are not aware of. But from the scriptures we get information. So just like this body is made of the earthly element that we have. There could be a body made of fire. There could be a body made of water. There could be a body made of air. There could be a body made of sky. So these are different types of material bodies for different creatures, for adapting or acclimatizing themselves to live in different places, different types of atmosphere. So the demigods live in higher planets. They are adapted to living in those conditions. So they are many times more intelligent than humans. They have much better facilities for living there. And they have much much longer duration of life. And they are pious, many times more pious than the pious human beings on the earth. So Srila Prabhupada describes the devatas. The demigods are more luxurious than human beings. But all of them are obedient to the orders of the Supreme Lord. Vishnu Bhaktas Vruto Daiva. This is the definition in the scriptures. All of them are devotees of the Supreme Lord. Therefore they are obedient to the order of the Supreme Lord. There is no one in the heavenly planets who is an atheist or non-believer.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that demigods are pleased when someone becomes a devotee of Krishna, clarifying that worshipping Krishna does not anger the demigods, but rather pleases them, highlighting the cooperation between the Lord, demigods, and devotees.

Thus any devotee of the Lord on the surface of the earth is always praised by them, the residents of the demigods in the heavenly planets. And in the case of Maharaj Pariksit, they were greatly delighted and thus gave tokens of honor by scattering flowers over the earth and by beating celestial drums. A demigod takes pleasure in seeing someone go back to Godhead. He is always pleased with a devotee of the Lord. So much so that by his Adi Daivik powers he may help the devotees in all respects. So sometimes people foolishly think that when the scriptures, we point out in the scriptures it is said you should exclusively worship Krishna and not the devatas. They think oh if we don't worship the devatas, devatas may become angry against us. But Srila Prabhupada is telling here devatas are always pleased with a devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna because they themselves are devotees of Krishna. So don't think that if a person who is in ignorance worshipping some devata stops devata worship and instead worships Krishna as Krishna is instructed in the Bhagavad Gita. Don't think that the devatas will become angry. No. On the other hand devatas will be very pleased with such a devotee. And by their actions the Lord is pleased with them. There is an invisible chain of complete cooperation between the Lord,

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and explains the 19th verse, focusing on the approval of Pariksit Maharaj's decision to fast until death by the assembled sages, referring to their approval as 'Sadhu Vada'.

The 19th verse Maharsha Yovai Samupagataye Prashasya Sadhu Iti Anumoda Manaha Uchuhu Prajanugraha Sheela Saara Yad Uttama Shloka Guna Bhi Roopam. The meaning of this 19th verse is as follows. All the great sages who were assembled there also praised the decision of Maharaj Pariksha, and they expressed their approval by saying very good. This is called Sadhu Vada. Naturally the sages are inclined to do good to common men, for they have all the qualitative powers of the Supreme Lord. Therefore they were very much pleased to see Maharaj Pariksha a devotee of the Lord, and they spoke as follows. So this is a description of what is the reaction of the great saintly persons who were assembled in that spot where Pariksha was sitting and fasting unto death in the holy place on the bank of the river Ganga. What is their reaction? They said very good. They approved Pariksha's decision to fast until death and prepare himself to go back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "The natural beauty of a living being is enhanced by rising up to the platform of devotion and service."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purport, explaining spiritual beauty and the nature of a Sadhu, emphasizing their dedication to the welfare of others and their complete surrender to Krishna.

The natural beauty of a living being is enhanced by rising up to the platform of devotion and service. This is called spiritual beauty. Spiritual beauty is different. Material beauty is different. Maharaj Pariksha was absorbed in attachment for Lord Krishna. Seeing this the great sages assembled were very pleased, and they expressed their approval by saying very good. Sadhu Vada. Sadhu. Sadhu. Because Pariksha requested them that I am asking your opinion whether it is appropriate for me to prepare myself to go back to Godhead by fasting until death after having renounced my kingdom. So they are telling very good because that is the natural way of preparation for quitting the body for a devotee of the Lord. Such sages are naturally inclined to do good to the common man. Sadhu means, the very word Sadhu means one who lives for the welfare of others. A Sadhu is not concerned about his own welfare because he is completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "And therefore the devotee finds everything auspicious."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe the qualities of a Sadhu and the auspiciousness of devotional service, highlighting how even a curse can become a boon for a pure devotee like Pariksit Maharaj.

He doesn't have to care for himself. On the other hand a Sadhu as a devotee. Sadhu means a devotee. So as a good devotee of the Supreme Lord, a Sadhu tries to do good to others always. So if he doesn't have to do anything for himself doesn't mean he is inactive. He is very very active in doing good for others. And when a Sadhu sees a personality like Maharaj Pariksit advance in devotional service such a Sadhu's pleasure knows no bounds. And such saintly persons offer all blessings in their power. The devotional service of the Lord is so auspicious that all demigods and sages up to the Lord himself become pleased with the devotee. And therefore the devotee finds everything auspicious. For a devotee is preparing to go back to God and nothing is inauspicious. All inauspicious matters are removed from the path of a progressive devotee. Meeting all the great sages at the time of death was certainly auspicious for Maharaj Pariksit, and thus he was blessed by the so-called curse of a Brahmana's boy. It's ironical that Pariksit was cursed but that curse turned out to be a boon in disguise. That's because Pariksit is a pure devotee.

**Key Quote:** "Foolish politicians who hold political administrative force think that the temporary post they occupy are the highest material gain of life and therefore they stick to those posts even up to the last moment of life without knowing that achievement of liberation as one of the associates of the Lord in his eternal abode is the highest gain of life"
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains Srila Prabhupada's purport on the verse, contrasting the attachment of materialistic politicians to temporary posts with the higher goal of achieving liberation and association with the Lord.

The meaning of this verse: the sages said, "O chief of all the saintly kings of the Pandu dynasty, who are strictly in the line of Lord Sri Krishna, it is not at all astonishing that you give up your throne, which is decorated with the helmets of many kings, to achieve eternal association with the Personality of Godhead." This is the praise of these assembled saintly persons with regard to Parikshit's action of renouncing his kingdom and coming to this holy place to prepare himself to go back to Godhead by fasting unto death. So, an elaborate purport is given by Srila Prabhupada explaining this appreciation of the saintly persons of Parikshit's action. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, "Foolish politicians who hold political administrative force think that the temporary post they occupy are the highest material gain of life, and therefore they stick to those posts even up to the last moment of life without knowing that achievement of liberation as one of the associates of the Lord in his eternal abode is the highest gain of life." Here, Prabhupada is comparing modern-day politicians who are those who are ignorant about spiritual reality. They think that to hold some very high position in this material world, even though it is a temporary position, they think that the post they occupy is the highest gain of their life, and they stick on to that position till they are forced to leave that by being forced to die, quit the body, and they are ignorant of the fact that they are not the body, they are spirit soul. Therefore, after quitting the body at the time of death, they have to enter another body. That they are not aware. But if they know about spiritual reality, then they understand there is something much, much, much, much greater to be obtained in this human form of life by practicing Krishna consciousness and achieving liberation to become one of the associates of the Supreme Lord in his personal abode in the spiritual

**Key Quote:** "This materialistic way of life is something like a grinding stone and we are being crushed by it."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami discusses Prahlad Maharaj's prayer to Lord Narasimha, highlighting the fear of the materialistic way of life and the suffering it entails, using the analogy of a grinding stone.

world that they do not know. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport further, "The human life is meant for achieving this end. This is the goal of human life." The Lord has assured us in the Bhagavad Gita many times that going back to Godhead, his eternal abode, is the highest achievement: *yad gatva nani vartante tad dhama paramam mama*; *madh karmakrana madh paramo madh bhaktasangavarjitah nirvaira sarvabhuteshu yassa mameti pandava yaktvadeham punarjanmaneti mameti sorjuna*. So, many places in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is talking about this. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, "Prahlad Maharaj, while praying to Lord Narasimha, said, 'Oh my Lord, I am very much afraid of the materialistic way of life.'" Prahlad Maharaj is a pure devotee, actually he is fearless, but still he is teaching us by telling that he is very much afraid of the materialistic way of life, and he further says, "I am not the least afraid of your present ghastly ferocious feature as Nrsimha Deva." Well, Lord Nrsimha appeared to protect Prahlad Maharaj against his demoniac father. Nrsimha was very, very, very angry. Against whom was he angry? He was angry against Hiranyakashyapu. He was never angry at Prahlad, and Prahlad knew this. Therefore, Prahlad is telling Lord Nrsimha, "I am not afraid of your ferocious form, because that ferocious form is meant for protecting the devotee. He is meant to chastise the non-devotee, atheist, demon," that the devotee is confident. And Prahlad Maharaj is telling why is he afraid of materialistic way of life. He is telling, "This materialistic way of life is something like a grinding stone, and we are being crushed by it." See, foolish people don't realize that taking birth in the material world means accepting a material body, and this material body is subject to so many miseries under the influence of these three *gunas* which are constantly harassing us in the form of different kinds of miseries being inflicted against our being—*vishnu*. *Adi bhautika klesha, adhyatmika klesha, adi daivika klesha, adi bhautika kess wastewater, abhyatmika klesha, vishulya, and any kunti and any sort of dem Dievikal klesha*. They don't want us to face the agenda beyond our awareness and control in the form of different kinds of miseries being inflicted against our wish. *Adi bhautika klesha Adi* spiritually 大以上的外外. And balanced by that divine nature and grit.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami continues explaining Prahlad Maharaj's prayer, using the analogy of being tossed in the ocean to illustrate the suffering in the material world and emphasizing the importance of seeking shelter at the Lord's lotus feet for liberation.

constantly being harassed by this. So, Prahlad Maharaj is giving an analogy, it's something like being crushed in a grinding stone continuously. And another example Prahlad is giving here when praying to Narasimha Deva, he is telling, "We have fallen into this horrible whirlpool of the tossing waves of life. My Lord, I pray at your lotus feet to call me back to your eternal abode as one of your servitors." Another example Prahlad is giving, suppose somebody who's meant to live on the land falls into the middle of the ocean, then ocean means continuously there are waves, and these waves will toss the person up and down, up and down. So, it will be a struggle to keep himself afloat because continuously waves will be coming and trying to overpower the person who has to protect himself against being drowned by those waves. So, in a similar way through this, Prahlad is telling, "This material world we are drowning in the waves of the attacked by Maya in the form of continuous miseries being inflicted through the *gunas*. Instead," Prahlad Maharaj is praying to the Lord, "Please call me back to your eternal abode as one of your servants." Prahlad further says, "This is the summit liberation of the materialistic way of life. If at all you want freedom from the suffering of this world, then you should simply aim to become one of the eternal associates of the Supreme Lord in his personal abode as his loving devotional servitor."

### material suffering, separation from Krishna, unwanted miseries

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In whichever species of life I have taken birth compelled by the force of my own activities I have very painfully experienced two things: separation from my beloved and meeting with what is not wanted."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami elaborates on Prahlad Maharaj's bitter experiences in the material world, focusing on the pain of separation from Krishna and the constant experience of unwanted miseries.

That is what Prahlad Maharaj is teaching in this prayer. And what is Pariksit praying for? He is also preparing to go back to the spiritual world to become one of the associates of the Supreme Lord. Further, Prahlad is telling, "I have very bitter experience of the materialistic way of life." He has already said it is like a grinding stone in which we are getting crushed, or like falling into a rock, or like falling into a middle of the ocean being tossed by the waves continuously. Now further he is telling the bitter experience he has had in this material world. What is that? "In whichever species of life I have taken birth, compelled by the force of my own activities, I have very painfully experienced two things." This is common for everyone, not just for Prahlad. Please hear carefully, two things that everyone is experiencing which they don't realize. What are the two things? Separation from my beloved. Who is our beloved? Our beloved is the Supreme Lord Krishna. In the material world we are separated from him. And the second thing is we all experience meeting with what is not wanted. Unwanted miseries are forced upon us in this material existence. And further Prahlad says, "To counteract these unwanted miseries, the remedies which I undertook were more dangerous than the disease itself." We are suffering from a disease called *bhava roga*. *Bhava roga* and material means to counteract this *bhava roga* are worse than suffering the disease of *bhava roga* itself. So, I drift from one point to another birth after birth. The misery doesn't stop simply by giving up one body thinking that my suffering will be coming to an end when I quit the body. Just like when somebody is suffering too much, they wish that they die rather than live, especially somebody who has got a terminal illness, chronic disease, they cannot tolerate the suffering and they wish and pray that I may die. But death is not the solution because they are going to take birth again, and taking birth again without preparing to go back to God, it means one more material body, and again that material body also under the clutches of Maya, they are going to suffer similarly. Therefore, Prahlad is concluding the prayer by telling, "I pray to you therefore to give me shelter at your lotus feet. I don't want to be under the clutches of Maya." That's what Prahlad is telling.

### detachment, parampara, following Krishna's instructions

**Key Quote:** "The Pandava kings who are more than many saints of the world knew the bitter results of materialistic way of life, they were never captivated by the glare of the imperial throne they occupied."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami concludes by highlighting the detachment of the Pandava kings and their readiness to give up their thrones to associate with the Lord, emphasizing the importance of following Krishna's instructions and living unattached to material possessions.

Now Srila Prabhupada continues by telling, "The Pandava kings who are more than many saints of the world knew the bitter results of materialistic way of life. They were never captivated by the glare of the imperial throne they occupied." They were very, very powerful. They were emperors of the world, entire world, very powerful, but they were not captivated by some allurement of Maya. Therefore, they always sought the opportunity being called by the Lord to associate with him eternally. They were just waiting, "As long as the Lord wants us to rule this world, we will rule, but when he calls us back, we are ready to go for eternal life there." So, this is temporary, material existence is temporary. So, Maharaj Parikshit said that, so Maharaj Parikshit was the worthy grandson of Maharaj Yudhishtira. So, just like Maharaj Yudhishtira gave up the imperial throne to his grandson, who is his grandson, Parikshit. Similarly, Parikshit gave up the imperial throne to his son Janamejaya. That is the way of all the kings in the dynasty. They are all strictly in the line of Lord Krishna. That is what is described in this verse by the sages. All the kings in these saintly dynasty of saintly kings, *Rajarshi Parampara*. Krishna says, *evam parampara praptam imam rajarsha yo viduh*, the saintly kings, they strictly follow the instructions of Krishna. They don't permanently hold on to any post in the material world. So, they live unattached to all the objects of materialistic way of life. They never are attached. So, giving up is very easy for them, and giving up for what? For spiritual life. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Srila Prabhupada's purport, contrasting the limited material creation with the vast spiritual sky (Paravyoma) and the Vaikuntha planets, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

This verse is spoken by the assembled sages. They have assembled in that holy spot where Pariksit decided to sit down to fast until death, preparing for quitting his body to go back home, back to the environment, on the bank of the river Ganga, a holy place. These sages who were received very respectfully by Pariksit, it was, keep saying that, Maharaj, they have come from different parts of the universe and they are all very, very great saintly persons and they could foresee that the Srimad Bhagavatam is going to be spoken and therefore they have come here to listen to the Bhagavatam. And the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, beyond the limitation of the material creation which is compared to the cloud in the sky, there is the paravyoma or the spiritual sky full of planets called Vaikunthas. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam. In the Bhagavad Gita it is said by Krishna. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . changes in terms of creation, maintenance and destruction. Unlike material nature, there is another spiritual nature. That spiritual nature is beyond this material creation, beyond the material sky.

**Key Quote:** "The information or the reality of the truth about spiritual planets in the spiritual sky is known only to the devotees only to bhakti yogis the category of transcendentalist called personalists or bhakti yogis or devotees"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while materialists and impersonalists have limited or incomplete understanding of the spiritual realm, only devotees (bhakti yogis) truly understand the Vaikuntha planets.

So, Srila Prabhupada is quoting that Bhagavad Gita and telling beyond the limitation of the material creation. Material creation is limited even though in the material creation there are millions of universes and each universe has millions of planets, each planet has millions of living entities but still it is comparable to a cloud in the sky. It is like a sky is very vast but the cloud is just few hundred meters or at the most a few kilometers spread over the sky, vast sky, expanse of the sky. Similarly, there is the Paravyoma, the spiritual sky, Paravyoma. Vyoma means the sky and Paravyoma is the spiritual sky. Now, the spiritual sky is not known to everyone. Of course, the materialists have no conception of spiritual nature at all because they only accept what is perceivable by their gross senses. And some other materialists who may accept something about the mind. They may imagine something beyond what is grossly manifest. But the transcendentalists from the authoritative scriptures are aware of the spiritual nature. But even among the spiritualists, there is a spiritual nature. transcendentalists who are aware of the spiritual nature the impersonalists only know about the spiritual sky which is called paravyoma or brahma jyoti or brahman manifestation beyond the material creation but they do not know that the spiritual sky is full of planets called vaikunthas so the information or the reality of the truth about spiritual planets in the spiritual sky is known only to the devotees only to bhakti yogis the category of transcendentalist called

**Summary:** The speaker lists various Vaikuntha planets and explains that they are named after the specific form of the Supreme Lord who predominates there, unlike the material world where different planets are ruled by different demigods.

personalists or bhakti yogis or devotees such vaikuntha planets are also differently known as proper gives the names of different vaikuntha planets just like the material planets we have names like brahma loka mahar loka jana loka tapo loka satya bhu loka bhuvar loka atala sutala vitala talatala like that so vaikuntha planets also have different names such as purushottama loka achyuta loka trivikrama loka hrishi kesha loka kesava loka aniruddha loka mada loka pradyumna loka sankarshana loka mada loka sridhar loka vaikuntha contains the ultimate nirvana of all things good and evil the true and absolute truth of the whole world is that Shridhara Loka, Vasudeva Loka, Ayodhya Loka, Dwarka Loka and many other millions of spiritual Lokas. So the name of the Vaikuntha planet if it is say the name is Purushottama Loka because it is predominated by the Supreme Lord whose name is Purushottama. If the predominating deity of the Vaikuntha planet is Trivikrama that planet is called Trivikrama Loka. If the predominating deity is Vasudeva it is called Vasudeva Loka like that. Now Dwarka is... Krishna's own abode. Ayodhya is Lord Ramachandra's own abode. Like this there are many millions of spiritual Lokas wherein the personality of Godhead predominates. Unlike in the material world the different planets the predominating deities are different Devatas. So different Devatas are different. Different living beings. But in the spiritual world in the spiritual sky the spiritual planets are predominated by one person.

**Key Quote:** "Unlike in the material world the different planets the predominating deities are different Devatas...But in the spiritual world in the spiritual sky the spiritual planets are predominated by one person."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the conditioned souls in the material world with the liberated souls in the spiritual planets, emphasizing that the latter possess spiritual bodies and are free from birth, death, old age, and disease.

One and only one Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now the Supreme Personality of Godhead himself even though he is one and only one person he expands himself in millions of forms each form having a different name. So according to the name of the particular form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the Loka also derives its name. Achyuta is one expansion of the Supreme Lord. So where Achyuta predominates that planet is called Achyuta Loka like that. Now the special thing about these planets is the spiritual planets is all the living entities there in the spiritual planets are liberated souls. They are all liberated souls. And in the material world in the material planets in the material universes all are conditioned souls. You see the difference. Here anybody who is taking birth in this material world with a material body is a conditioned soul. The liberated souls never accept a material body. They live in the spiritual planets Vaikuntha Lokas. They live with spiritual bodies as good as that of the Lord. The Lord has a spiritual body. He never comes in touch with matter. He never has any material contact or material body never. So just like the Lord the living entities also there are liberated souls with spiritual bodies as good as that of the Lord. There is no material contamination. We are just come. Everything there is spiritual. And therefore there is nothing objectively lamentable. Vishokam. They are full of transcendental bliss and are without birth, death, old age and disease. See the material world is characterized by these four defects. Janmamrtyu, Jaravyadhi, Dukha, Doshanu, Darshanam. That is a description of the material world. The spiritual world in the spiritual planets there is no birth, no death, no disease, no old age.

### Goloka Vrindavana, Maharaj Pariksit, reaction to sages

**Summary:** The speaker mentions Goloka Vrindavana as the supreme abode of Lord Krishna and explains that Maharaj Pariksit was destined to achieve it, then introduces the 22nd verse and describes Pariksit's positive reaction to the sages' words.

Amongst all the above mentioned Vaikuntha Lokas there is one supreme Loka called Goloka Vrindavana, which is the abode of the Lord Shri Krishna and his specific associates. Maharaj Pariksit was destined to achieve this particular Loka, Shri Krishna Loka or Goloka Vrindavana. And the great rishis assembled there could foresee this. All of them consulted among themselves about the great departure of the great king, and they wanted to see him up to the last moment, because they would no more be able to see such a great devotee of the Lord. The 22nd verse: Ashutyata Drishiganavaca Pariksit Samam Madhuchad Guru Chavyalikam Abhashata Enan Abhinandya Yuktaan Shushrusha Manah Charitani Vishnu. The meaning of this verse is, "All that was spoken by the great sages was very sweet to hear, full of meaning and appropriately presented as perfectly true." They have very great personality, so when they speak, it is very, very pleasing to the ears, and it is full of meaning. When they speak it is very, very pleasing, so it is full of meaning, and appropriately presented as perfectly true. They are above illusion. They are liberated souls, so when they speak everything is perfectly true. So after hearing them, Maharaj Pariksit, desiring to hear of the activities of Lord Shri Krishna, the personality of God had congratulated the great sages. So Maharaj Pariksit congratulated the great sages. This is Pariksit's reaction. When the sages spoke something, what was his reaction? So that we describe what Pariksit's reaction was in the next verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Bhagavan Sri Krishna is full of six kinds of opulences Aishwarya"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on why Parikshit is glorifying the sages, emphasizing their selfless welfare activities and then explaining the six opulences of Bhagavan, referencing Srila Prabhupada's purport.

Parikshit is glorifying the great sages who assembled there in that holy place. So, Parikshit is telling them, you have very kindly assembled here. Why is he telling like this? Because these sages, they have no personal interest, they only want to do welfare activity for the others, for the other conditioned souls, so therefore they are very great personalities, they are very kind to everyone, so they have kindly assembled there and they have come from different parts of the universe. The universe is very vast compared to one tiny planet that we know of, the earth planet. The universe is very vast and they are being described as good as supreme knowledge personality personified. The Sanskrit that is used is Veda Yatha Murti Dharaha. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport six kinds of opulences namely wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation: Aishwarya, Viriya, Yasha, Shri, Jnana, Vairagya. These are the six opulences are all originally the different attributes pertaining to the absolute personality of the universe and the absolute personality of the universe and the Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "The sum total of all wealth belongs to Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker continues to describe the opulences of Krishna and compares them to the limited opulences of living entities, mentioning the 78% figure from the scriptures.

Krishna. So Bhagavan Sri Krishna is full of six kinds of opulences Aishwarya Samagrasya, the sum total of all wealth belongs to Krishna. Similarly, the sum total of all the strength belongs to Sri Krishna, like that all the six opulences. The living beings who are part and parcel entities of the supreme being have all these attributes partially up to the full strength of 78 percent. Partially means the Lord has unlimited quantity of these six opulences and the living entities have very, very, very, very, very little of these opulences. Living entities have a limited quantity of each of these opulences. Lord has unlimited quantity of these opulences, so this difference eternally exists under all conditions whether the living beings have very, very, very, very, whether the living being is conditioned soul or is a liberated soul. Living being always is a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and is always very tiny, has got limited opulence. So what is this 78% that Prabhupad is talking about? This has got reference to a comparison made in the scriptures. So that is what I am trying to explain and what it says in majlis that are the quantities of the such that God tensor Lageen ji Maha Padopal the sovereignness of the time it says thatu 살sayeri Tamsil Baseela chant 라 clothing tons of the living being already if Allah has arisen to share a partial soul or has window of seeking himself autistic of the supreme lord and is always very tiny has got limited opulence.

**Key Quote:** "The supreme personality of godhead has got unlimited qualities but among those qualities the important qualities the principal qualities are counted as 64."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the 78% figure by comparing the 64 qualities of Krishna to the 50 qualities of living entities, and how material energy covers these attributes.

between the qualities of the living entities and qualities of the supreme personality of godhead. The supreme personality of godhead has got unlimited qualities, but among those qualities, the important qualities, the principal qualities are counted as 64. Out of the 64 qualities, the living beings, the jivatmas have only 50 qualities. So both in terms of the number of principal qualities when they are compared between the living entities and Krishna, living entities have 50 and supreme lord Krishna has 64. So that 50 divided by 64 comes to 78 percent. If you work out that arithmetic it will come to 78 percent. That's what is being talked about by Prabhupada. The living entities or living beings have up to full strength of 78. In the material world these attributes up to 78 percent of the Lord's attributes are covered by the material energy, they are never exhibited as completely spiritual, but they are covered by the material energy.

**Key Quote:** "Just like the sun is covered by a cloud...similarly the original glare is pushed toward the..."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of the sun being covered by a cloud to illustrate how material energy covers the original spiritual form and effulgence of living entities.

Now an example is given, just like the sun is covered by a cloud. Sometimes it happens that the sun will be shining in the sky, but when the sun becomes covered by a cloud, the sun cannot get covered by a cloud, it appears like that to our eyes. What is blocking our view of the sun? Sun is very huge, but what is blocking the view of our sight when we try to see the sky where sun is present? We cannot see there is a cloud because the cloud is blocking our vision. Cloud cannot block the sun. So here it is said the covered strength of the sun is very dim compared to the original glare. Sun is very, very, very powerful. So the sunshine that is emanating from the sun planet, this sunshine its original glare is very, very bright, but when covered by a cloud you can dimly see some light in the sky. Similarly, the original glare is pushed toward theuis aqui similarly the original glare is pushed toward the heat of the sun andきた comes as a light right here but theASE in this case it is suppose to be visible light in the sky, but when covered by the cloud we can dimly see some light in the sky. Similarly, the original glare is very bright when covered by a cloud it is possible to see some light in this kind the strong..... color of the living beings with such attributes becomes almost extinct. So, the living entities have got their original spiritual form, have got their original effulgence, but that is covered by the material energy, covered by the material energy.

In Satyaloka that is Brahma's own planet, planet where Brahma resides. Satyaloka the inhabitants are fully cognizant of Vedic wisdom and thus the mystic cloud of material energy is cleared when one becomes enlightened in the Vedic wisdom. Then this material energy cannot cover one's intelligence or one's mind, not possible. So they are called liberated souls therefore they are known as the Vedas personified because they are fully cognizant of the Vedic wisdom. They know the Vedas conclusion of the Vedas such persons being fully aware of knowledge both mundane and transcendental have no interest in either the mundane or transcendental worlds. So mundane world is this material world and transcendental world is Vaikunthaloka the spiritual planets in the spiritual sky in the spiritual world beyond the material creation.

How to die before you die? Of the two, the question relating to the dying man is most important because everyone is a dying man, either very shortly or after 100 years. Especially on the earth planet, everyone is a dying man, mriyam aane hi. Especially those are about to die, mriyam aane hi. The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty of a dying man is very important. The whole of Bhagavad-Gita actually talks about duty, so that karma refers to prescribed duties.

Maharaj Pariksit placed these two questions before Sukadev Goswami also on his arrival. We will hear in after a few verses the arrival of Sukadev Goswami in that assembly. So therefore this chapter is entitled the appearance of Sukadev Goswami. So these two questions in Pariksit ask the assembled sages, the saintly persons, great sages, the same two questions he'll place in front of Sukadev Goswami a little later.

The conclusion arrived at thereof is that devotional service of the Lord Shri Krishna, as it is confirmed by the Lord himself in the last phases of the Bhagavad Gita, is the last word in relation to everyone's permanent duty in life. Situationally, according to our present condition or situation, we may have some temporary duties, like a student has got a duty to study as long as the student. A householder has a duty towards maintenance of his family members, but that is also limited to the period of the life of the householder.

So Maharaj Pariksit was aware as a devotee, but he wanted the great sages assembled there to unanimously give their verdict on his conviction, so that he might be able to go on with his confirmed duty without controversy. See, Pariksit is taking a very humble position. He is respecting the great sages who are assembled there as superiors, even though he himself is a pure devotee and is well aware that his only business is spiritual activity.

Now Pariksit has especially mentioned the word Shuddha are perfectly correct. For transcendental realization or self realization, many processes are recommended by various classes of philosophers. In this material world, always there are different class of philosophers. Ah, Srila Prabhupada talks about the first class method, ah, or process of, ah, uh, transcendental realization, the second class method, and the third class method. So Prabhupada says the first class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender onto the lotus feet of the Lord and thus be safe on all sin and their sins. So first the first class method that says may stock one up all other methods and give reactions this is the first class method this is the method of bhakti bhakti yoga the other methods are dhyana yoga ashtanga yoga dhyana yoga or ashtanga yoga then there is one more method called buddhi yoga the same as bhakti yoga then there is dhyana yoga so all different methods different processes without exerting oneself without taking a risk guaranteed success at the end of this life you can take a risk and you can take a risk and you can take a risk and you can take a risk and you can take a risk and you can take a risk that is possible only when adopts the first class method of bhakti yoga.

Only then it is possible. Krishna certifies that bhakti yoga is the first class method. What does he say? Yoginam api sarvesham madgatena antaratmana shraddhavan bhajate yomam same yuktatamomata ha. Yuktatama means is most intimately united with me in yoga, who? The one who with devotion, faith, renders devotional service to me.

So therefore, yuktatamomata. So I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Devotional service is so satisfying that a person taking satisfaction from always being engaged in devotional service loses all interest in material affairs."
**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of 'Bhagawan' and its application to great devotees like Shukadeva Goswami, emphasizing their detachment from material affairs due to their engagement in devotional service.

And the description is a wonderful description of Shukadeva Goswami. He is described, Prabhupada explains that in the purport elaborately. He is described by so many nice adjectives. Bhagawan. Here Bhagawan, Prabhupada says in the purport, in the purport Prabhupada says the word Bhagawan is sometimes used in relation to some of the great devotees of the Lord, like Shukadeva Goswami. Bhagawan actually means the supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna. Bhagawan, one who possesses six particular opulences to an unlimited degree. That is a precise definition: Ayishwar Yashya Samagrasya Veer Yashya Yashyasa Shreyaha Gyanavairagya Yoshchaiva Shannambhaga Itingana. This is very specific, specific definition for the word Bhagawan, when it applies to the supreme personality of Godhead, Krishna. But here Bhagawan is used for Shukadeva Goswami. Sometimes Bhagawan is used for Vyasadeva. Sometimes Bhagawan is used for Narada. Now when it is used in relation to some of the great devotees of the Lord, then it is explained by Prabhupada. Why? It doesn't mean that they are God. No. Such liberated souls are disinterested in the affairs of this material world. This is a characteristic. They are all liberated souls. So because they are liberated, they are completely pure. They don't have any taint. They don't have any taint of material contamination. They are never touched by any of the three gunas, three material modes. So they are always spiritually active. They are only engaged in spiritual activities, even in this material world. Now Shri La Prabhupada explains, why is it that they are disinterested in the affairs of this material world? Because they are self-satisfied by great achievements of devotional service. Devotional service is so satisfying that a person taking satisfaction from always being engaged in devotional service loses all interest in material affairs. Therefore it is described, disinterested in material affairs.

**Key Quote:** "Shukadeva Goswami is a liberated soul by birth so he doesn't need to study the Vedas he doesn't need to practice any process of self-realization because it is already self-realized"
**Summary:** This segment discusses Shukadeva Goswami's unique position as a liberated soul by birth, explaining why he didn't require formal spiritual training or reformatory performances like Upanayana.

Anapek shah, disinterested in material affairs. As explained before, Shukadev Goswami never accepted any formal spiritual master, nor did he undergo any formal reformatory performances. This was explained right in the beginning of the Bhagavatam, first canto, second chapter, divinity and divine service, when Suta Goswami begins to speak, address the sages of Naimisharanya, the beginning of the Bhagavatam, opening of the Bhagavatam, the sages ask Suta Goswami six questions and Suta Goswami answers them. So before he begins to answer, he offers his prayers to his spiritual master, whose Suta Goswami's spiritual master? Shukadeva Goswami. So in that, in those prayers, he says that Shukadeva Goswami is a liberated soul by birth. He is liberated soul by birth, so he doesn't need to study the Vedas, he doesn't need to practice any process of self-realization because it is already self-realized. Though before he studied the Bhagavatam under his father Vyasa Deva, he was only realized, he had only realized the impersonal aspect of the absolute truth, Brahman, realized his soul. There are three of the absolute truth: Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. So Shukadeva Goswami had realized only the Brahman feature. But after he heard the Bhagavatam, he became fully self-realized in the Bhagavan feature also. Brahman, Paramatma, Bhagavan. So Bhagavan is the highest realization, complete realization of the absolute truth. And Bhagavan realization includes Brahman and Paramatma realization. So after hearing the Bhagavatam, Shukadeva Goswami became Bhagavan realized, became a great devotee of the Supreme Personality. Got it? So he never accepted any formal spiritual master, like one goes to Gurukul or one takes initiation and begins to study the scriptures under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master. No, he did not have to do that. Nor did he undergo any formal reformatory performance. Reformatory performance is samskara, purification, cultural purification. Just like Upanayana, the sacred thread ceremony. That signifies that one is eligible to study the Vedas under the spiritual master. One receives the Gayatri mantra from the bona fide spiritual master and one begins study of the Vedas. But Shukadeva Goswami did not have to undergo any of these samskaras including Upanayana because he was already a liberated soul. He was realized. He didn't have to study the Vedas.

**Key Quote:** "This dissatisfaction is because none of the literatures you have compiled, in none of them you have exclusively glorified the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Vyasa Deva compiled the Srimad Bhagavatam under the instruction of Narada, focusing on the exclusive glorification of Krishna, and how Shukadeva Goswami heard the Bhagavatam from his father.

Shukade Goswami's father Vyasa Deva was his natural spiritual master. Why natural spiritual master? Because Shukade Goswami heard Srimad Bhagavatam from Vyasa Deva, his own father. Vyasa Deva was compiling the Bhagavatam after being instructed to do so by Narada. This has already been described in an earlier chapter in this first canto, fifth chapter. Vyasa Deva, after compiling all the Vedic literature, after compiling the Mahabharata, after compiling the other Puranas, Dharmasastras, everything he did, extensive work for the welfare of the human beings, in this Kali Yuga especially, he was dissatisfied, feelings incomplete. So his spiritual master Narada noticed this dissatisfaction and pointed out, this dissatisfaction is because none of the literatures you have compiled, in none of them you have exclusively glorified the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna. So Narada instructed Vyasa Deva to compile this Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the only literature, which is containing the exclusivity, exclusive glorification of Krishna and nothing else. So Vyasa Deva compiled the Bhagavatam exactly according to the instructions of Narada, and when he was revising the Bhagavatam, Shukadeva Goswami heard the Bhagavatam from Vyasa Deva. Shukadeva Goswami got attracted to the description of Krishna in the Bhagavatam, so he began inquisitive, who is this personality Krishna? Special personality. Not another person like so many other historical persons, no. He is the absolute truth. He is the personality of Godhead Bhagavan, who is the absolute truth. So that he realized by hearing the Bhagavatam. He was father Vyasa Deva, natural spiritual master. Father is described as the first spiritual master. In the case of Brahmanas especially, father is the first spiritual master. And Vyasa Deva was self-realized himself. He was a great devotee, empowered incarnation. So Vyasa Deva taught the Bhagavatam to Shukadeva Goswami.

### Shukadeva Goswami, Self-Realization, Avadhuta, Social Customs

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, Avadhuta means disinterested in all social customs."
**Summary:** This segment describes Shukadeva Goswami's complete self-satisfaction after hearing the Bhagavatam, his indifference to social customs, and his status as an Avadhuta, similar to Nithyananda Prabhu and Rishabhadeva.

Now after hearing the Bhagavatam from Vyasa Deva, Shukadeva Goswami became completely self-satisfied, Nijalabha Tushto, completely satisfied within himself. Thus, he did not depend upon any formal process. The formal processes are necessary for those who are expected to reach the stage of complete liberation. But Shukadeva Goswami is already in that status by the grace of his father, so he didn't require it. As a young boy, it is described here, he was dressed as if neglected by others. That means, he did not care to dress himself properly. In fact, he was not even dressed. He was walking around naked. That we will describe a little later in the next verse. So he went about naked, uninterested in social customs, indifferent to everything. That, people following the civilized society, he was disinterested. He was neglected by the general populace. If somebody walks naked, not properly tending the body, not properly dressing themselves, common people will not be able to identify that here is a great personality. No. They will think he is some madman. So they will generally neglect. They will not pay any attention. But, he was surrounded by inquisitive boys and women, less intelligent persons, as if he were a madman. Why will somebody walk naked unless they are mad? So, we should understand, those who are spiritually very, very, very, very advanced, not just advanced, they are completely self-realized, but they are disinterested in social customs. They are called Avadhuta. Nithyananda was Avadhuta. And Nithyananda Prabhu, the associate of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, member of the Panchatattva, incarnation of Lord Balarama, he was an Avadhuta, like Shukadeva Goswami was an Avadhuta. Rishabhadeva, he became Avadhuta, later stage of his life, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord. So, Avadhuta means disinterested in all social customs.

**Key Quote:** "Even though he may appear to be like, simply roaming without any particular aim in life, but actually he is directed by the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing that even though a liberated soul may appear aimless, they are actually guided by the Supreme Lord within their heart, leading them to perform specific actions like speaking the Bhagavatam to Parikshit Maharaj.

So, it is described by Srila Prabhupada here, he thus appears on the scene while traveling on the earth of his own accord. He is freely roaming. But, we should also know, he is directed by the Supreme Lord within his heart. There is a characteristic of a liberated soul. Even though he may appear to be like simply roaming without any particular aim in life, but actually he is directed by the Lord. He is constantly in touch with the Supreme Lord within the heart. So, Supreme Lord directing him, go and speak Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj. So, he has appeared there. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

All three verses are describing the personal features of Sukhadeva Goswami, a great personality. So, to recognize him is not easy, as somebody very, very great, very exalted pure devotee, fully realized, is very difficult to make out. As you would have heard in the previous words, he was avadhuta. He was completely disinterested in properly dressing himself, in displaying any symptoms of belonging to any particular social order. No, none of those could be made out by his appearance.

Here, Sanskrit, dvi ashta, 2 times 8 is 16. So, he was only 16 years old. His legs, hands, thighs, arms, shoulders, forehead, and other parts of his body were all delicately formed. Sukumara, very delicately formed. His eyes were beautifully wide. Beautifully wide eyes he had. His nose and ears were highly raised. Raised nose and raised ears. He had a very attractive face.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the science of physiognomy, explaining how external bodily features can reveal inner qualities and how the sages in Pariksit's assembly could recognize Sukhadeva Goswami's greatness.

So, these beautiful features are special. If somebody observes him very carefully, not thinking he is a madman, that we described how the members of that assembly, the saintly persons in Pariksit's assembly, some of them, they could recognize a person by studying the name of the person. By studying his external features, that is called the science of physiognomy. It's a special science. The bodily features when observed externally can tell a lot about that personality, the nature of that personality within. Because the person is not the body. But still, great persons by their external bodily features, they are recognized by those who know these specific symptoms by which to recognize such personalities. So, Sri

**Key Quote:** "A person is honored for his achievements and not for advanced age."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada, emphasizing that honor is due to achievement, especially spiritual, rather than age, and that Sukhadeva Goswami's knowledge surpassed that of the elder sages.

La Pravapa says in the purport, a respectable personality is described beginning with the legs. And this honored system is observed here with Shukadeva Goswami. Always from the bottom to the top. Even the Supreme Lord, we should have darshan of the deity of the Supreme Lord beginning with the feet, and then gradually move up. He was only sixteen years of age. Compared to the other persons in the assembly, probably he was the youngest in that assembly of great saintly persons. So, Shri La Pravapa remarks here, a person is honored for his achievements and not for advanced age. Merely being elderly in terms of physical age is not the basis of honoring somebody. That alone is not the basis. So, a person is honored for his achievements, especially when they have spiritual achievements. A person can be older by experience and not by age. Shri Shukadeva Goswami, who is described herein as the son of Vyasa Deva, was by his knowledge more experienced than all the sages present there, although he was only sixteen years of age.

**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing physiognomy, highlighting the uncommon symptoms in Sukhadeva Goswami's appearance and using the example of Lord Ramachandra's long arms (Aajanabahu) as a sign of greatness.

So, Srila Prabhupada explains these bodily features of Shukadev Goswami. In the purport, his bodily features indicate him to be different from common men. Distinct features are there by which he can be distinguished as an extraordinary personality, even among great persons. So, Srila Prabhupada says, all the signs described in connection with the bodily features of Shukadev Goswami are uncommon symptoms, typical of greatness, great personalities according to physiognomical calculations. See, there are many branches of Vedic knowledge. One of them is how to recognize a person's greatness by studying his external features. For example, if somebody's arms, when they stretch, when they're standing and they stretch the arms in front of their body, it goes below their knees. That is called Aajanabahu. Aajanabahu. That's a description of Lord Ramachandra. Lord Ramachandra, when he appeared, he had his hands, when he stretched, it would reach up to his knees or even below his knees. No common personality will have such a description. No common personality will have such arms in a human form, will have his arms reaching up to his knees, it will always be above the knees, you can check, you stretch your arms, it will reach only somewhere in the thigh region, it will not reach up to your knees, unless you are a great personality. So, one of the symptoms is of a great personality, the arms will reach up to the knees.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the 28th verse, describing Sukhadeva Goswami's youthful beauty and how the expert sages recognized and honored him despite his attempt to conceal his glories, contrasting this with the common people's perception.

The 28th verse, the meaning of this 28th verse is, he was blackish, shamam, and very beautiful due to his youth, very beautiful due to his youth. Because of the glamour of his body and his attractive smiles, he was pleasing to women, though he tried to cover his natural glories. The great sages present there were all expert in the art of physiognomy, and so they honored him by rising from their seats. They were all seated. Parikshit Maharaj received the great saintly persons who arrived from all over the universe. They arrived before Shukadeva Swami came to that assembly. So, they were all seated and Parikshit Maharaj bowed down to them and acknowledged their presence, glorified them. But now they were standing up to receive Shukadeva Swami, who could not be recognized by common people, who thought him some mad man. They neglected him and he was surrounded by some urchins and some foolish people, but he is a madman. But not these sages who knew the art of physiognomy. They recognized him as a very, very, very great personality simply by seeing his bodily features. So, that is the description here, that Lakshanagya, the sages, very, very great personalities from the upper planets of the universe, they have arrived there. So, they could recognize, even though gudavarchasam, his glories were covered externally. Common people cannot make out he is a great person, and that too when he is walking naked, you will think he is some great personality. So, these sages could recognize, so they all stood up out of respect for Shukadeva Swamy.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit was very glad to receive a great devotee of the Lord, and he bowed down before Shukadeva Goswami with all the limbs of his body."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the arrival of Shukadeva Goswami and the respectful reception he received, particularly Maharaj Pariksit's humble obeisances, and how Shukadeva Goswami reciprocated greetings based on individuals' positions.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Narayanam Namaskritya, Naram Jai Vanarottamam, Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. So, in this session, we'll be discussing three more verses, the 29th, the 30th, and the 31st verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These set of verses are describing the appearance of Shukadeva Goswami, and so far we have heard the sages in that assembly, they stood up out of respect for Shukadeva Goswami, recognizing him to be a very, very great personality. What was Pariksit's reaction? That we are going to hear now. 29th verse. Sravishnurato atithaya agataya tasmaisa pariyam shirasajahara tato nivrttahi abudhastriyo arbhaka mahasanesopavishesha pujitaha Sorry. mahasanesopavishesha pujitaha The meaning of this verse is, Maharaj Pariksit, who is also known as Vishnurata, Vishnurata means one who is protected always by Lord Vishnu, he bowed his head to receive the chief guest, Shukadeva Goswami. At that time, all the ignorant women and boys ceased following Srila Shukadeva. He was surrounded by some urchins and some foolish women, so all of them became alerted that here is a great personality, he is not a madman, so then they stopped following him, they just disappeared from there. Receiving respect from all, Shukadeva Goswami took his exalted seat. It's in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains very nicely. On Shukadeva Goswami's arrival at the meeting, everyone except Srila Vyasadeva, Narada and a few others stood up. See, it was described, great sages, because of physiognomy, they could recognize Shukadeva Goswami, even though he is not properly dressed by his external bodily features, so they stood up out of respect. But not Vyasadeva Narada. Why? Because Vyasadeva is Shukadeva Goswami's own spiritual master. Narada is the spiritual master of the spiritual master. Narada is Vyasadeva's spiritual master. So Vyasadeva and Narada did not stand up, and few others who were great personalities, they did not stand up. But everybody else stood up out of respect for Shukadeva Goswami. Now, what about Maharaj Pariksit? It is described here. Maharaj Pariksit was very glad to receive a great devotee of the Lord, and he bowed down before Shukadeva Goswami with all the limbs of his body. Dandavat, dandavat pranama, or sastanga pranama, different ways this is said. So here it is described that he bowed down with all his limbs of his body. Saparyam shirasam ajaharao. With all the limbs of his body, he bowed down completely to Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami also exchanged the greetings and reception by embrace, shaking of hands, nodding and bowing down, especially before his father and Narada Muni. Shukadeva Goswami knew how to exchange greetings, depending on the different person's position or achievements. So with some equals, he was shaking hands. With juniors, he was embracing them. And acknowledging some people's greetings by nodding his head. And especially to his father Vyasadeva and Narada Muni, he bowed down himself, because he is a junior. Thus, Shukadeva Goswami was offered the presidential seat at the meeting, because he was the greatest, realized, advanced, spiritually advanced personality of his time, recognized by all other great persons. So he was offered the seat of the president of the assembly, the chief person in that assembly of Parikshit Maharaj. When he was so received by the kings and sages, the street boys and less intelligent women who were following him were struck with wonder and fear. So they retired from their frivolous activities. Everything was full of gravity and calm. You see how the whole atmosphere changed completely after the arrival of Shukadeva Goswami.

**Summary:** This segment describes the glorious appearance of Shukadeva Goswami in the assembly, comparing it to the moon surrounded by stars, emphasizing his radiance amidst other great personalities.

The 30th verse. The meaning of this 30th verse is Shukadeva Goswami was then surrounded by saintly sages and demigods, just as the moon is surrounded by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. His presence was gorgeous and he was respected by all. So, Shukadeva Goswami's appearance there in the assembly of Parikshit Maharaj is very, very special, because in that assembly, Parikshit Maharaj himself is a pure devotee, the greatest Rajarshi of his time. And other Rajarshis, Devarishis, Brahmarishis, Arunodayas, they all arrived from different parts of the universe to witness Parikshit Maharaj quitting his body. So, in that great assembly, how was Sukhadeva Goswami appearing? Like the moon is surrounded by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. This is a natural beauty in the sky at night, especially on a full moon night. How does it look? The moon will be shining the brightest among all the other heavenly bodies in the sky as seen from the earth at night. But the other heavenly bodies will be twinkling like stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. Moon will outshine all others, all other heavenly bodies, particularly on a full moon night. So, that is the beauty, natural beauty. So, this presence, the presence of Sukhadeva Goswami surrounded by all varieties of saintly persons, all great personalities is compared to this moon in the night sky, full moon surrounded by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The devotee of the Lord is more honored in the world than the Lord himself."
**Summary:** This segment explains that a devotee of the Lord is more honored than the Lord Himself, quoting Krishna's instruction to Uddhava that His devotees should be worshipped with greater respect than Him.

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, In the great assembly of saintly persons, there was Vyasadeva, the Brahmarshi, Narada, the Devarishi, Parashurama, the great ruler of Kshatriya kings, etc., Rajarishi. Some of them were powerful incarnations of the Lord. Parashurama was an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. Vyasadeva was an incarnation. Narada was an empowered incarnation. Sukhadeva Goswami was not known as Brahmarshi, Rajarishi, Devarishi, nor was he known as an incarnation, like Narada, Vyasa or Parashurama. Yet, he excelled all of them in respects paid. There is something very, very important to note. Sukhadeva Goswami, in spite of not having a formal position like all the many other personalities in the assembly, great personalities, he was offered more respect than all of them. Why? Srila Prabhupada explains, This means that the devotee of the Lord is more honored in the world than the Lord himself. So, Srila Prabhupada many times quotes another verse in the Bhagavatam. Krishna, while instructing Uddhava in the 11th canto of the Bhagavatam, he says to Uddhava, Madbhakta Pooja Abhyadhika What does it mean? Krishna says, My pure devotee, who is very, very dear to me, he should be respected more than me by the others. Madbhakta Pooja Abhyadhika He should be worshipped with greater respect than me. Krishna is the topmost worshipable personality among all worshipable personalities in this whole universe. But it is Krishna's own choice that he would be more pleased if instead of worshipping Krishna, we worship Krishna's pure devotee. So, therefore, Prabhupada concludes this purport by telling, One should therefore never minimize the importance of a devotee like Shukadeva Goswami.

**Key Quote:** "One should humbly approach a spiritual master to understand the transcendental signs."
**Summary:** This segment describes Shukadeva Goswami's readiness to answer questions and Maharaj Pariksit's humble approach to him, emphasizing the importance of approaching a spiritual master with humility and proper etiquette.

31st verse Prasantham asinam akuntha medasam munim rupo bhagavato abhyupetya pranamya murdha avahita avahita tutanjalir natwagira sunruta anvaprichat So, the meaning of this 31st verse is The sage Shri Shukadeva Goswami sat perfectly pacified, intelligent and ready to answer any question without hesitation. Shukadeva Goswami knew by the indication of the Paramatma within his heart what is he supposed to do in that assembly. Even without Pariksit speaking, before Pariksit could even speak anything, he knew why he was there, what was his purpose in being brought there by the Supreme Lord, and what was he supposed to do in that assembly, everything he knew. So, it is described, he sat perfectly pacified. He was the most intelligent personality among all the persons assembled there. And therefore, he was ready to answer any question without hesitation. He was fully knowledgeable, fully self-realized, greatest authority. So, he was ready to answer any question. Because, already we have heard, Shukadeva Goswami, Pariksit Maharaj asked two questions from the assembled saintly persons. So, Prabhupada says further, The great devotee Maharaj Pariksit approached him, offered his respects by bowing before him, and politely inquired with sweet words and folded hands. Pariksit inquired from him. So, what Pariksit, what inquiry did he make of Shukadeva Goswami will be described in the later verses. But, Prabhupada says in the purport, The gesture adopted by Maharaj Pariksit of questioning a master is befitting in terms of scriptural directions. What do scriptural directions say? One should humbly approach a spiritual master to understand the transcendental signs. One must approach a bona fide spiritual master. So, Pariksit Maharaj is already actually fully aware what he is supposed to do. He has already told assembled saintly persons, kindly sing the glories of Vishnu, so that I can fix my mind on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord before I quit my body. But, when Shukadeva Goswami came, as a matter of etiquette, he approached Shukadeva Goswami with folded hands and actually began to inquire about the transcendental signs, assuming humble position.

In this session we will be discussing from the 33rd verse of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, येशाम सम्स्मरनात पुम्साम, सद्यशुद्यन्तिवैगृहाह, किम्पुनर्दर्शनस्पर्ष, पादशौच आसनादिपिही। The meaning of this verse is, "Simply by our remembering you, our houses become instantly sanctified, and what to speak of seeing you, touching you, washing your holy feet, and offering you a seat in our home." This is Pariksit speaking to Shukadeva Goswami, addressing Shukadeva Goswami. That, the spiritual potency of a pure devotee who is completely immersed in Krishna consciousness is so great, simply by remembering him, one's house becomes, one's surroundings, one's place becomes completely sanctified instantaneously. In what way sanctified? All the material influences are, negative influences are nullified, just by remembering a saintly person like Shukadeva Goswami. And then if one is more fortunate, one is able to not only remember him, but even see him, touch his holy feet, wash his feet, and give him a seat of honor, and serve him by hearing from him, worshipping him,

**Key Quote:** "The presence of the great saints in such holy places disinfects the accumulated sins."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that holy places are sanctified by the presence of great saints who counteract the sins left behind by ordinary people who visit those places for purification.

So, Shri La Prabhupada explains in the purport, the importance of holy places of pilgrimage is due to the presence of great sages and saints. What is the, why is a place called a holy place of pilgrimage? It is primarily because in that place great saintly persons are present. And by their presence what happens to that holy place? That's explained by Shri La Prabhupada in the next sentence in this purport. Prabhupada says, it is said that sinful persons go to holy places and leave their sins there to accumulate. Anybody goes to holy place, ordinary people, they will take a bath there, and they will leave behind their sinful reactions. They get purified. They get purified means, their sinful reactions are washed away by going there and taking a bath in the holy place. But, the presence of the great saints in such holy places disinfects the accumulated sins. Now so many people go to holy place, ordinary people, big numbers, they go, and they leave behind all their sinful reactions. Now those sinful reactions become a burden, a big burden in the holy place. But that burden is cleared away by the presence, mere presence, of the saintly persons like Shukadeva Goswami. And, because of the presence of the saintly persons in such holy places, the holy places continue to remain sanctified by the grace of the devotees and saints present there. See this is not known to many people. This is explained in another place in the Bhagavatam. So Prabhupada is quoting from that portion of the Bhagavatam, that a holy place becomes burdened by sinful reactions of those ordinary people who visit the holy place and wash away their sinful reactions. But such accumulated sin is cleansed away by the presence of saintly persons.

**Key Quote:** "The only aim of such saints is to sanctify the houses of the householders."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that when saints visit the homes of worldly people, they do so without self-interest, aiming only to purify the house and help the householders advance spiritually.

Now further Srila Prabhupada says, if such saints appear in the homes of worldly people, certainly the accumulated sins of such worldly enjoyers becomes neutralized. Home also, people are staying, ordinary people stay in their home. But, generally they are inclined to enjoy materially, and thereby accumulate some sinful reactions. Now, if such a home is visited by a saintly person like Shukadeva Goswami, then again, the home becomes completely purified. Home becomes completely purified. That's what Shukadeva Goswami, Parishad Maharaj is telling Shukadeva Goswami. Therefore, Prabhupada says further, the holy saints actually have no self-interest with the householders. That means, when a saintly person visits a home of an ordinary person, a worldly person, then the saint has nothing to get for himself from the householder. Don't mistakenly think that when saints come to your house, genuine saints, I'm talking about genuine saints, they come to your house, it's not that they want some bhiksha, they want some benefit from you, they want to take something from you, no. It's never. They have no self-interest. The only aim of such saints is to sanctify the houses of the householders. Only aim, to purify their house, to make their house free from sinful reactions, so that it will benefit them to practice spiritual life,

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of householders being grateful and welcoming to saints, and the consequences of dishonoring them, including the need for fasting to neutralize the offense.

Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says further, the householders should feel grateful when such saints and sages appear at their doors. So when a saintly person comes to the door of a householder, householder should welcome them and take spiritual benefit from their presence. A householder who dishonors such holy orders is a great offender. It's an offense to not honor such a saintly person. It is enjoined, therefore, that a householder who does not bow down before a saint at once must undergo fasting for the day in order to neutralize,

### Bodily Identification, Ignorance, Materialism, Spiritual Platform

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "If this attitude a person has, such a person is considered Saha eva Goh Kharaha. He is no better than an animal, like an ass or a cow."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Krishna speaking about the ignorance of identifying with the material body and the foolishness of seeking purification in holy places only for material enjoyment, comparing such a person to an animal.

So, the Bhagavatam says, in the 10th canto, these are very strong words, strongly worded words, they are spoken by Krishna in the 10th canto, in an assembly of saintly persons at Kurukshetra, when there was solar eclipse. There was a gathering of saintly persons on that occasion, and Krishna was speaking to the saintly persons. Krishna had gone there as the king of Dwaraka. Krishna is playing that role in his pastimes, in his Leela, Dwaraka, the king of Dwaraka. So, Krishna is telling, a human being who identifies this body, this material body, made up of three elements, with the self, Yesya Atma Buddhi, who am I? Actually, most people think, I am this body, this body, this body is who I am, is myself. But, Shastra says, no, scripture says, no, Bhagavad Gita says, no, this body is not you, you are not the body, you are spirit, soul. So, what if a person, in ignorance, mistaken identity, that I am this body, and what is this body made of? It is described here, Kunape, Tridhatuke, Kunape means a bag consisting of three dhatus, three elements. What are the three elements? According to Ayurveda, this body is made up of Kapha, Vata, and Pitta. Kapha is mucus, Vata is air, and Pitta is bile. So, somebody who thinks this bag is, this bag is, this bag is, this bag is, this bag is, a point, this bag is called the physical body, which consists of three elements, somebody thinks this has the self, and further, Swadhi, Kalatra, Deishu, who considers the byproducts of the body to be his Kingsman, that is, my wife, my children, they are all mine, who considers his land of birth, they give a lot of importance. I have taken birth, let us say, in Mysore. So Mysore is a very, very, very important place for me. And he thinks, such a person, a materialistic person, an ignorant person, a foolish person, a person under the influence of the illusory energy, thinks that one should go to a place of pilgrimage simply to take a bath, so that if all my sins are washed away, I don't have to suffer any sinful reaction. I can enjoy without any hindrance. If this attitude a person has, such a person is considered Saha eva Goh Kharaha. He is no better than an animal, like an ass or a cow. Kharaha means ass, and Goh means cow. That means he is not a human being with developed intelligence.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session we will be discussing from the 32nd verse of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Just to refresh your memory this chapter is entitled The Appearance of Shukadeva Goswami. In this chapter it will be described how Shukadeva Goswami and Pariksit Maharaj met at a time when Pariksit was actually prepared. To quit his body after having renounced his kingdom he was in a holy place on the bank of the river Ganga and he was surrounded by so many saintly persons from all over the universe and exactly when Pariksit was inquiring from the sages assembled there that kindly tell me what is my duty. Exactly at that time Shukadeva Goswami walks into that assembly and the description has already been given in the previous few verses. The appearance of Shukadeva Goswami was certainly a very very divine event that he was sent by Krishna. And he was sent by Krishna. And he was sent to speak Srimad Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj for the first time after it was compiled by Vyasadeva under instruction of Shri Narada. So this 32nd verse now Pariksit is addressing Shukadeva Goswami after Shukadeva Goswami has been welcomed he has taken the seat the seat of honor. And when everyone has settled down acknowledging. Shukadeva Goswami's most exalted position is the top most among the transcendentalists of his time even though he is just 16 years old and he doesn't formally belong to any category of transcendentalists as Brahmarshi or Rajarshi or Devershi or Arunodaya. He is not. Formally initiated he has not undergone any reformatory process samskara. Yampravra jantam anupetam apetakrutyam in the beginning of the Bhagavatam in the first canto in the same canto second chapter. Suta Goswami offers respects to his spiritual master Shukadeva Goswami and he says my spiritual master. He was a liberated soul by birth he did not undergo any reformation after his birth because he already liberated so that Shukadeva Goswami was recognized by the great transcendentalists rishis who had arrived from higher planets. They knew the art of physiognomy. That means by looking at the external. Features bodily features face symptoms the the build up they could say here is some very very very advanced transcendentalist so they all stood up in respect except Vyasa Deva and Narada Muni Vyasa Deva was the father of Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami natural spiritual master and Narada was the spiritual master of the spiritual master Jick Riva swan the spiritual master of. Vyasa Deva so they did not stand up and few others. Parashurama the incarnation of the supreme personality of Godhead. So they did not stand but everybody else stood up in respect and Parikshit Maharaj was very glad to receive him now what is Parikshit telling Shukadeva Goswami.

**Key Quote:** "It is more abominable than drinking poison willingly. That means, it is very very dangerous. It is a big big big obstacle for spiritual advancement."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the principle of detachment from worldly enjoyers and women for serious transcendentalists, using the example of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu refusing to meet King Pratap Rudra and quoting a verse emphasizing the danger of associating with materialistic individuals.

So, it is also true that great saintly persons who are completely aloof from worldly enjoyers, they do not bother to meet or contact or approach any of the materialistic persons or people in royal position, big big kings, big big wealthy merchants, people in big positions in material estimation, they never approach. So, Srila Prabhupada next gives an example. Maharaja Pratap Rudra was a follower of Lord Chaitanya. He was the king of Orissa. But when Maharaja Pratap Rudra wanted to see the Lord, see Lord Chaitanya, Lord Chaitanya refused to see him because he was a king. So, Pratap Rudra, even though he was a king, he was a saintly king. So, he was seeking an interview with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu just to get blessings, just to get some instructions, personal instructions, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was staying in Puri. So, Pratap Rudra, who would not give any appointment, would not agree to meet Pratap Rudra Maharaj, why? Why would Chaitanya refuse? Prabhupada says, for a devotee who desires to go back to Godhead, two things are strictly prohibited, worldly enjoyers and women. Now, this is based on a verse that is there in the Chaitanya Charitamrita. That verse says, The meaning of this verse is, It is more abominable than drinking poison willingly. So, as Prabhupada says in this purport, two things are strictly forbidden for a serious transcendentalist who is practicing spiritual life in order to get out of material existence entirely and go back to Godhead. So, this verse says, this is a verse quoted by, spoken by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. When Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was requested by one of his associates, Sarvam Bhattacharya, that please give an appointment for Maharaj Pratap Rudra who wants to come and see you, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, no, I cannot give an appointment. Why? This is the reason he is quoting. Nishkinchanasya, for one who is completely detached himself from material enjoyment. Bhagavad Bhajanon Mukhasya. And, he is engaged, eager to be engaged in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For him, and also, Paramparam Jigamishor Bhavasagarasya. He wants to cross over the ocean of material existence and go back to Godhead. For such a person, Sandarshanam, just seeing. Not even mixing or interacting. Not even interacting very closely. No, just seeing. Sandarshanam. Two categories of people. Vishayinam, Yoshitam. Vishayinam means those who are engaged in materialistic activities. Vishayinam. Sense enjoyers in this world. And, Yoshitam means women. Women here refers to a member of the opposite gender. Who is very much interested in enjoying. For a woman, it is man. Yoshit is man. For a man, a Yoshit is woman. Who is interested in enjoying. Such a Darshan, just a Sandarshanam, just seeing, is very, very dangerous. How dangerous? More dangerous than drinking poison willingly. Than knowingly drinking poison. That means, it is very very dangerous. It is a big big big obstacle for spiritual advancement.

Pratap Rudra Maharaj. Why? Why would Chaitanya refuse? Prabhupada says, for a devotee who desires to go back to Godhead, two things are strictly prohibited, worldly enjoyers and women. Now this is based on a verse that is there. Here in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, that verse says, Nishkinchanasya Bhagavad Bhajanon Mukhasya Paramparam Jigamishor Bhavasagarasya Sandarshanam Vishayinam Atha Yoshitamcha Hahantahantavishabhakshanatopyasadhu The meaning of this verse is Alas for a person who is seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Krishna without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification or seeing a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly. So, as Prabhupada says in this purport, Two things are strictly forbidden for a serious transcendentalist who is practicing spiritual life in order to get out of material existence entirely and go back to Godhead. So, this verse says, this is a verse quoted by, spoken by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. When Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was requested by one of his associates, Sarvam Bhattacharya, that please give an appointment for Maharaj Pratap Uddhara who wants to come and see you. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, no, I cannot give an appointment. Why? This is the reason he is quoting. Nishkinchanasya, for one who has completely detached himself from material enjoyment. Bhagavad Bhajanon Mukhasya And he is engaged. Eager to be engaged in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead for him and also Paramparam Jigamishor Bhavasagarasya. He wants to cross over the ocean of material existence and go back to Godhead. For such a person, Sandarshanam, just seeing, not even mixing or interacting very closely, no, just seeing, Sandarshanam, two categories of people. Vishayinam, Yoshayinam. Vishayinam means those who are engaged in materialistic activities. Vishayinam, sense enjoyers in this world. And Yoshayinam means women. Women here refers to a member of the opposite gender who is very much interested in enjoying. For a woman, it is... For a man, Yoshayinam is man. For a man, Yoshayinam is woman who is interested in enjoying. Such a Darshan, just a Sandarshanam, just seeing, is very, very dangerous. How dangerous?

So, therefore, such a transcendentalist will never agree to see or meet or interact or mix with such worldly-minded people. Therefore, Parikshit Maharaj, thinking, I am a king, and Shukade Goswami has arrived and he has accepted my respects and his... agreed to sit in this assembly and instruct me. So, I am very, very, very, very fortunate and blessed by Shukade Goswami. So, I will stop here. Thank you very much.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead, who is very dear to the sons of King Pandu, has accepted me as one of those relatives just to please his great cousins and brothers."
**Summary:** Parikshit Maharaj emphasizes the close family connection between Krishna and the Pandavas, highlighting their devotion.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the thirty-fifth and the thirty-sixth verses of the nineteenth chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The thirty-fifth verse is as follows: Apime Bhagavan Preetaha Krishna Pandu Sutapriyaha Paitrishvaseya Preetyartham Tadgotrasyathabandhavaha The meaning of this verse is, Lord Krishna, the personality of Godhead, who is very dear to the sons of King Pandu, has accepted me as one of those relatives just to please his great cousins and brothers. This is what Parikshit has spoken while addressing Shukadeva Goswami. Parikshit is particularly relating the close connection between his grandparents, Arjuna and the other Pandavas, their connection with Krishna in a family relationship. So Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead, but when he appears in this world, he definitely does take his birth, even though he is unborn. He takes his birth as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. Now Vasudeva is a Kshatriya, and Vasudeva's sister, Kunti, her sons are the Pandavas. So there is a family relationship between Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead, and the Pandavas, their cousins. Not only that, the Pandavas are great devotees of Krishna, pure devotees of Krishna. So, given these facts, Prabhupada explains the significance of this particular statement by Parikshit Maharaj.

### Devotion vs. Illusion, Family service through devotion, Krishna's protection of devotees' families
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/gLgxrCFkVVs?t=251

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord gives special protection to the family members and descendants of a devotee, even though such members are themselves non-devotees."
**Summary:** Prabhupada explains that pure devotees serve their families better than those attached to illusory family affairs, as Krishna protects the families of devotees.

In the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "A pure and exclusive devotee of the Lord, serves his family interest more dexterously than others who are attached to illusory family affairs." Pure devotees are never under illusion. But commonly, ordinary people, they are completely under illusion, because their relationships are based on, "I am this body, and therefore, all bodily connections are mine. My wife, my children, my relatives, my brothers, my cousins, my aunt." You see, totally based on illusory family affairs. Whereas the pure devotees, the Pandavas, they know that Krishna is related to them, but independent of that relationship, they are pure devotees of Krishna. You see, so that makes a big difference. So Prabhupada says, "Generally people are attached to family matters, and the whole economic impetus of human society, is moving under the influence of family affection. Such deluded persons have no information, that one can render better service to the family, by becoming a devotee of the Lord." People think that if I become a devotee, I have to cut off all my relationships with my family members, and completely forget them, as if I have nothing to do with them. That's not correct. That understanding is not correct. Why? Because, Prabhupada says, "The Lord gives special protection to the family members and descendants of a devotee, even though such members are themselves non-devotees." Of course, in the case of Pandavas, they were all devotees. Pandu was a devotee. Kunti was a devotee. Subhadra was a devotee. Draupadi was a devotee. Everyone was a devotee. But, here is an example. Maharaj Pariksit was a great devotee of the Lord, but his father, Hiranyakashipu, was a great atheist, and declared enemy of the Lord. Even though the Lord is nobody's enemy, but these atheists and non-devotees, they consider Vishnu or Krishna as their enemy. Despite all this, Hiranyakashipu was awarded salvation, salvation means liberation, due to his being the father of Maharaj Prahlad. Krishna is so kind. Hiranyakashipu does not deserve to get liberation. He is an atheist. But, just because he is the father of a great devotee, Prahlad, the Lord gave liberation to this Hiranyakashipu. So, Srila Prabhupada says further, "The Lord is so kind that he gives all protection to the family members of his devotee, and thus the devotee has no need to bother about his family members, even if one leaves such family members aside to discharge devotional service."

**Key Quote:** "Krishna personally saved this Pariksit when he was in the womb of his mother, because this Pariksit was the only surviving descendant of the entire Pandava family."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna takes care of the family members of devotees, even if the devotee has to give up family responsibilities to serve the Lord's mission, citing the example of Parikshit being saved by Krishna.

Generally, when somebody dedicates oneself to serving the mission of the Lord, they may have to give up the family responsibility. Then, is there a loss for the family members? That somebody is giving up their responsibility and not discharging family duties, duties towards family members? No, because Krishna takes care. Maharaj Yudhishthira and his brothers were the sons of Kunti, the paternal aunt of Lord Krishna. And Maharaj Pariksit admits the patronage of Lord Krishna because of his being the only grandson of the great Pandavas. Krishna personally saved this Pariksit when he was in the womb of his mother, because this Pariksit was the only surviving descendant of the entire Pandava family.

### Inspiration by Krishna, Recognition of pure devotees, Benefit of hearing Bhagavatam

**Key Quote:** "Krishna arranged, Pariksit should hear Bhagavatam, so that Pariksit is benefited, by Shukadeva Goswami speaking the Bhagavatam, and not only Pariksit, through Pariksit, many many millions of people, and all future generations of people, are benefited."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Shukadeva Goswami was inspired by Krishna to appear before Parikshit and impart the teachings of Srimad Bhagavatam, benefiting not only Parikshit but also future generations.

The 36th verse, Anyathate avyakta-gathir darshanam na katham drinam nitharam mriyamananam samsiddhasya vaniyasah The meaning of this 36th verse is, otherwise, without being inspired by Lord Krishna, how is it that you have voluntarily appeared here, though you are moving incognito, incognito means unrecognized to the common man, and are not visible to us for on the verge of death. Shukadeva Goswami was just roaming around, as if he has no aim in life, he has nothing to do with society, he is not having any proper social appearance, he was roaming around naked, he appeared like a madman, and he did not bother about what people thought, what people said, the way people reacted, he never bothered about it, he was completely absorbed within himself in Krishna Consciousness. So, such a paramahamsa, who cannot be recognized by most people, and he himself has come voluntarily, he has walked into that assembly, and Pariksit is able to recognize him, because of, of course, Pariksit can recognize Shukadeva Goswami, because Pariksit himself is a pure devotee, it takes a pure devotee to recognize another pure devotee, but there is another way, that is, great saintly persons, who are recognized spiritual authorities, they certify that here is a pure devotee, because when Shukadeva Goswami walked into that assembly of great saintly persons, they immediately recognized him, and stood up in respect, and welcomed him with folded hands into that assembly, and he was offered the seat of honor, the presidential seat in that assembly, by all present. So, Pariksit Maharaj is telling that I am so fortunate that you have come at the time when I am about to die, so I can get your instructions, I can get your advice. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "The great sage Shukadeva Goswami was certainly inspired by Lord Krishna to appear voluntarily, before Maharaj Pariksit, the great devotee of the Lord, just to give him the teachings of Srimad Bhagavatam." Krishna arranged Pariksit should hear Bhagavatam, so that Pariksit is benefited, by Shukadeva Goswami speaking the Bhagavatam, and not only Pariksit, through Pariksit, many many millions of people, and all future generations of people, are benefited.

### Spiritual Master, Guru-Krishna Kripa, Authorized Representative of the Lord, Direct Help from Krishna

**Key Quote:** "To get the assistance and help of a bona fide spiritual master means, to receive the direct help of the Lord himself."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of the spiritual master as the manifested representative of the Lord, stating that receiving help from a bona fide spiritual master is equivalent to receiving direct help from Krishna.

So, Prabhupada says, one can achieve the nucleus of the devotional service of the Lord, by the mercy of the spiritual master, and the personality of Godhead. This is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, in his teachings, Guru Krishna Kripaaye Paaye Bhakti Lata Bheech. The spiritual master is the manifestation or manifested representative of the Lord, to help one achieve ultimate success. Nothing is disconnected in the life of a devotee. Everything is in relationship with Krishna. One who is not authorized by the Lord, cannot become a spiritual master. It's not that somebody is a very learned scholar, therefore he is Guru, or somebody has got some mystic, magical, mystic powers, and therefore he is Guru. No. None of these things are qualifications. They may have mystic power, they may not have mystic power. They may be very learned, they may not be learned, formally I mean, formally no learning. But the important point is, the spiritual master is necessarily authorized by the supreme personality of Godhead, and he acts as the representative of the Supreme Lord. So, Srila Shukadeva Goswami is an authorized spiritual master, and thus he was inspired by the Lord to appear before Maharaj Parichar, and instruct him in the teachings of the Srimad Bhagavatam. One can achieve the ultimate success of going back to Godhead, if he is favored by the Lord's sending of the spiritual master. So, one can achieve the ultimate success of going back to Godhead, if he is favored by the Lord's sending. So, the conclusion is, that to get the assistance and help of a bona fide spiritual master means to receive the direct help of the Lord himself. So all of us, who have got Srila Prabhupada as our spiritual master, we are directly getting the help of Krishna himself. This is what we should understand and realize, and accept, and take advantage.

### spiritual master, death, perfection

**Key Quote:** "I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for all persons and especially for one who is about to die."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 37th verse of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining Parikshit Maharaj's question to Shukadeva Goswami about the path to perfection, especially for one facing imminent death.

In this session, we will be discussing two verses, that is, the 37th and the 38th verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Shri Madbhagavatam. The 37th verse is as follows: Ataprishami Samsiddhim Yoginam Paramam Gurum Purushasyehayatkaryam Priyamanasya Sarvatha. Now, Parikshit is asking Shukadeva Goswami a very specific question. What is that question? That is a translation of this verse, the 37th verse: You are the spiritual master of great saints and devotees, Yoginam Paramam Gurum. The same thing was said by Suta Goswami at the beginning of the Bhagavata. Suta Goswami offered prayers to Shukadeva Goswami, and he said to him, "This is the question that was asked to Shukadeva Goswami before he began speaking Bhagavatam to the sages of Naimisharanya." There he described that Shukadeva Goswami is the spiritual master of great saints and devotees. So Parikshit is telling, "I am therefore begging you to show the way of perfection for all persons, and especially for one who is about to die, Purushasyeha yatkaryam mriyam anasya sarvatha." Mriyam anasya means one who is about to die. His own position: He is going to meet with death in seven days. So he is preparing for quitting the body, but he is preparing by asking the greatest of the transcendentalists, the spiritual master of great saints and devotees. He is asking such a personality, "Kindly show the way of perfection for everyone, including me."

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the purpose of a spiritual master, emphasizing that their role is to guide individuals towards perfection and out of material entanglement, aligning with Krishna's mission.

who is about to die. So, in the purport, Prabhupada explains, "Unless one is perfectly anxious to inquire about the way of perfection, there is no necessity of approaching a spiritual master." That means a spiritual master is only meant for one thing in everyone's life. He is not meant for anything else. He is meant for showing the path of perfection for everyone in this material world who is entangled in the material existence, because that is Krishna's mission in this material world. That is what Krishna wants. Why this creation? Actually, there is no need for Krishna to create, because there is a whole spiritual world, perfect, complete, full of transcendental bliss, full of transcendental knowledge, full of everything required for our perfect existence.

**Key Quote:** "Because I want to enjoy independent of Krishna... This is utter foolishness because there is no such thing that you can enjoy independently."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the futility of seeking independent enjoyment separate from Krishna, explaining that the material world is created to facilitate this desire, but ultimately Krishna also makes arrangements to help us return to Him.

But foolish persons that we are, we left everything and come here. And why have we left that and come here? Because I want to enjoy independent of Krishna. This is utter foolishness, because I want to enjoy independent of Krishna, because there is no such thing that you can enjoy independently, because that is not your position, that is not your actual position. There is no existence for you without the help of Krishna, without support of Krishna. There is no existence. So Krishna is so kind that because we are adamant, he makes arrangement. He is all powerful, so he makes arrangement. What arrangement does he do? He creates this material world, and after creating for us to try and enjoy independently, he is making elaborate arrangements, because we have got so many varieties of desires, how I like to enjoy independently. So many arrangements Krishna has made. So to get us out of this madness, trying to enjoy in so many different ways unsuccessfully, Krishna is actually also making arrangement to help us to get out of this madness.

**Key Quote:** "A spiritual master is not a kind of decoration for a householder... this is not what a Guru is meant for, for material happiness."
**Summary:** The speaker warns against engaging with so-called spiritual masters who focus on material happiness, emphasizing that a genuine spiritual master guides towards ultimate spiritual benefit, not temporary material gains.

So Krishna himself comes for that purpose, to extricate us, to get us out of this entanglement, and he sends his bonafide spiritual masters, the pure devotees, for the same purpose that he comes. He also sends them from his personal abode. So Prabhupada says, "A spiritual master is not a kind of decoration for a householder." Some people, for a fashion, they say, "We also have a Guru. I have got this Guru." And what for you have got a Guru? "Oh, he gives me blessings by which I will be materially very, very happy." This is not what a Guru is meant for. For material happiness, material happiness, there are millions of ways, concocted ways, illusory ways. Spiritual master is not meant for that. So Prabhupada says, "Generally a fashionable materialist engages a so called spiritual master without any profit." Any profit means without any real benefit, spiritual benefit. "The pseudo spiritual master flatters the so called disciple, and therefore both the master and his ward, that is the disciple, go to hell."

**Summary:** The speaker laments the scarcity of genuine spiritual masters who can provide ultimate solutions to life's problems, contrasting them with those who cater to material desires.

Without a doubt, you see, this material world is a place which is full of material actions and reactions. So foolish disciples, they approach even greater fools who pose as spiritual masters and only ask from them, "How can I be materially happy? How can I get some material wealth? How can I get some material sense gratification?" And the foolish spiritual masters, so called spiritual masters, they also either in ignorance or even sometimes those who are not ignorant also by way of cheating, they try to give some material wealth, give some material happiness, material wealth, material solutions to their problems. Where is the bona fide guru to be found in this world who will give ultimate solution to all problems? Such spiritual masters are very, very rare.

**Summary:** The speaker praises Parikshit Maharaj for asking vital questions relevant to everyone's welfare, highlighting that these questions form the foundation of the Srimad Bhagavatam.

in this material world. And so we have to understand this point. So Prabhupada says about Pariksit Maharaj, "Maharaj Pariksit is the right type of disciple because he puts forward questions vital to the interest of all men, particularly for the dying man." Pariksit's questions are very, very vital. They are of the utmost importance. You can ask a spiritual master so many different questions, but the essential questions which are relevant for our ultimate welfare, for getting us out of this material entanglement, those questions are not generally asked by common people. So about Pariksit Maharaj, Prabhupada says, "The question put forward by Maharaj Pariksit is the basic principle of the complete thesis of Srimad Bhagavatam." See, Pariksit asked one or two questions in the beginning, but the answer to those two questions led to Shukadeva Goswami speaking the entire Srimad Bhagavatam. So you can imagine how vital those questions are. Now let us see how intelligently the great master replies. This is how Prabhupada is ending the purport of this particular verse, how Shukadeva Goswami will answer these vital questions.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the 38th verse, focusing on Parikshit's intelligent inquiry about what one should do (hear, chant, remember, worship) and what one should avoid.

The 38th verse: yad srotavyam atho japyam yad kartavyam nrbhit prabho smartavyam bhajaniyam va bruhiyadva viparyayam. Very intelligent question asked by Pariksit Maharaj to Shukadeva Goswami. Already he has asked in the previous verse. What question has he asked? "Kindly show the way of perfection." Now he is asking, what is he asking now in the 38th verse? The translation is, "Please let me know what a man should hear, yad srotavyam, what he should chant, yad japyam, what he should remember, smartavyam, and worship, bhajaniyam, what is worship about for him, and yadva viparyayam, and also kindly tell me what he should not do." He is asking both positive and negative, what he should do and what he should not do. This is very, very intelligent question.

**Key Quote:** "It is very important that we should know for achieving the ultimate perfection specifically what we should do and also what we should not do."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding both positive and negative injunctions (vidhi and nishedha) in Vedic literature for achieving ultimate perfection.

Please explain all this to me. So we should understand Pariksit is most intelligent king of his time. So he is asking, of course he is asking about his own welfare, but he is also asking about the others' welfare. He is also asking about others' welfare. So it is very important that we should know for achieving the ultimate perfection specifically what we should do and also what we should not do. That is why in the Vedas there are so many instructions, but they all can be broadly classified into two different set of instructions: what is to be done and what is not to be done, vidhi nishedha. This is explained elsewhere by Srila Prabhupada. All the Vedic injunctions can be classified in two headings: vidhi means what you should do, and nishedha means what you should not do.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that the most important positive injunction is to always remember Krishna, and the most important negative injunction is to never forget Krishna, emphasizing that this is the key to achieving perfection.

And in the Bhagavatam it is said among all these different instructions, the most important positive injunction that you must do is always remember Krishna. What is the most important positive injunction of the Vedas? Always remember Krishna. And what is the most important negative injunction? Never forget Krishna. It is very interesting. Both are the same. Both are the same. Now, always remember Krishna means never forget Krishna. Never forget Krishna means always remember Krishna. Why is it said like this? Because the only thing you need to do to achieve perfection is to always remember Krishna and never forget him. Simply by doing that you will get all perfection. Now, how to do it, that's another matter, but this is the injunction, the most important injunction. So if somebody is not able to directly take up this always remembering Krishna, then there are other methods by which they are brought to that point, and that is the entirety of the Vedic literature. I will stop here.

**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami introduces the Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining its structure of 12 cantos, chapters, and verses, highlighting the significance of the 10th canto which focuses on Krishna Leela.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing two verses, the 39th and the 40th verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the last two verses in this chapter, and with the end of this chapter, even the first canto comes to an end. So these are the last two verses of this entire canto itself of the Srimad Bhagavatam. As you might be aware, Bhagavatam is divided into 12 cantos, skandha in Sanskrit, and each of those cantos have got many chapters, and each chapter has got many verses. So totally, the number of verses is 18,000 in the Srimad Bhagavatam, and the number of cantos is 12, and there are different number of chapters in each canto. Just like this first canto has 19 chapters, the second canto has 10 chapters, whereas the 10th canto has got 90 chapters, 9-0, the biggest canto. Why? Because the 10th canto exclusively describes Krishna Leela. The other cantos describe the pastimes of the other incarnations of the Supreme Lord, and even the pastimes of the activities of the devotees of the Supreme Lord, including the devotees of Krishna like the Pandavas.

### Vedic Culture, Renunciation, Importance of Cows, Householder duties

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In the Vedic culture, even the poorest of the householders keep at least 10 cows."
**Summary:** The lecture delves into the meaning of verse 39, discussing the Vedic culture where householders maintain cows and provide milk to mendicants, emphasizing the self-sufficiency and charitable nature of this lifestyle.

So, 39th verse. The meaning of this 39th verse is, "O powerful Brahmana! It is said that you hardly stay in the houses of men long enough to milk a cow." Shukadeva Goswami has appeared in that assembly. Now, what is the duration for which if Shukadeva Goswami goes to somebody's house? So, Prabhupada explains this in the purport. Saints and sages in the renounced order of life go to the houses of householders. At the time, they milk the cows early in the morning and ask some quantity of milk for subsistence. Even though somebody will be completely renounced from everything material, as long as this body is there, for the bodily maintenance, at least devotees, they beg for some milk. And from whom do they beg? From the householders who keep cows. That's the Vedic culture generally. Vedic culture means the householders generally keep at least one cow or a few cows, and they have some land for growing some food. Very easily all economic necessities can be met by having some land for cultivation of food grains, vegetables, growing some flowers or fruits, and also having one or more cows. So, Prabhupada says the householders are able to not only get enough for themselves, but if some saintly person comes begging, Bhavati bhikshan dehi, they want very little, little milk. So the householders can easily give that little milk. So, Prabhupada says a pound of milk fresh from the milk bag of a cow is sufficient to feed an adult with all vitamin values, and therefore saints and sages live only on milk. Very, very easy. They take some milk, drink that, and that's enough to give them all necessary nutrition for their subsistence, for engaging in devotional service exclusively, without the need for gathering some grains, cooking it, preparing some foodstuff. Either oneself or somebody else has to prepare nothing. Directly take the milk, especially when milk is being taken from the cow, the cow is being milked, just take that milk, drink it, finished, over. So, Prabhupada says in the Vedic culture, even the poorest of the householders keep at least 10 cows. This is Vedic culture, each delivering 12 to 20 quarts of milk, and therefore no one hesitates to spare a few pounds of milk for the mendicants.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, to take advantage of the saintly persons coming for begging is the real business of a householder."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that saintly persons stay only briefly, and householders should use that opportunity to gain spiritual knowledge, emphasizing the importance of association with saints.

But, these are, but, I don't know, I don't know the exact conversion of these quarts to pounds. Of course, pounds, generally one pound is about half a kilo, kilogram. And I think quarts means something like some 15 or 20 quarts make a pound, something like that. So, when they have ten cows, each of those cows can give so much milk, and they have plenty of milk to even spare for, even the poorest of householders is considered poor householders. They can spare some milk for the saintly persons who come begging. Anybody can give. So, Srila Prabhupada says it is the duty of householders to maintain the saints and sages like the children, like their own children. They give some milk at least to those who come begging for some milk, milk or food. So, a saint like Shukadeva Goswami would hardly stay at the house of a householder, for he would hardly stay for more than five minutes. He would hardly stay for more than five minutes. That means he would not even stay for five minutes at the house of a householder. So, what does this mean? In other words, such saints are rarely, very rarely seen in the houses of householders, very rarely. If at all they approach a householder, little milk, less than five minutes. When they are milking the cow, just take little milk and go on. So, therefore, Maharaj Pariksit therefore prayed to Shukadeva Goswami to instruct him as soon as possible. So, Raupar is giving us a lot of instructions here. Householders should understand saintly persons when they come begging, they are not going to stay for long. So, to take advantage of the saintly persons coming for begging is the real business of a householder, the real duty of a householder.

### Spiritual Knowledge, Material Bondage, Purpose of Existence, Reciprocal relationship between saints and householders

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The purpose of our existence should be to get that which is not available anywhere and what is that how to extricate oneself from this material bond"
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes that householders should seek spiritual knowledge from saints, focusing on liberation from material bondage rather than material benefits, highlighting the unique value that saints can provide.

That from the saintly persons, get some valuable spiritual sustenance, spiritual instructions to make one's life completely successful in attaining ultimate liberation or complete total liberation from all material bondage, and it's possible for everyone. So Srila Prabhupada says the householders also should be intelligent enough to get some transcendental information from visiting sages. Saintly person means they're exclusively meant for giving spiritual knowledge, spiritual instructions for achieving ultimate perfection. The householder should not foolishly ask a saint to deliver what is available in the market, some material thing. Sometimes people think, "Oh, sadhu, he can give me some treatment by which I will get cured of some disease, and he'll do it free of charge. He will not charge me. If I go to a doctor, doctor may ask for some fees, or I have to purchase some medicine. Doctor may write a letter to the doctor. If I go to a doctor, doctor may ask for some fees, or I have to purchase some medicine. Doctor may write a letter to the doctor, some medicine I have to purchase. The sadhu, he will do it free. There's no need of money." So this is not very intelligent, is foolish. Ask the sadhu what he can give which nobody else can give, which is not available anywhere for purchase or even for free. Nothing is available other than from such pure devotees. Nobody else can give you. So ask for that. A similar verse is there in the earlier chapter, we discussed this, fifth chapter, first canto, tasya eva heto prayatetu kovido nalayateta yad brahmate pessoal sRY on this image那 ربward من الصحpre suchen narad unaisi ka motherfucker for р quotaiedy instructing the asadeva, one should actually live for that purposeful end which is not obtained by wandering throughout the entire universe, all the planetary systems. The purpose of our existence should be to get that which is not available anywhere, and what is that? How to extricate oneself from this material bond, how to get out of this material bondage. That you cannot get simply by going to different planets with different material facilities, or somewhere you've got long duration of life, somewhere you've got siddha loka, you can get all mystic powers, somewhere you got very nice beautiful gardens called nandana kanana, and somewhere else you have got some lot of nice vegetables, fruits, flowers. This is not the purpose of existence. The purpose of existence is how to get out of this material bondage and get eternal freedom, complete total freedom. That is the real purpose. So, Shri Prabhupada concludes by telling that should be the reciprocal relation between the

saints and the householders. The 40th verse, the last verse, the meaning of this verse is, "Shree Sruthi Goswami said, the king thus spoke and questioned the sage using sweet language. Then the great and powerful personality, the son of Vyasa Deva, who knew the principles of religion, began his reply after hearing the question just asked very sweetly, very nicely." His Pariksit himself is a great devotee. The devotee is qualified in multiple ways. He can ask the perfect and precise question. He can ask the question in very sweet words. He is well behaved. So this is another fact about a devotee. One who is a pure devotee of Krishna, he has got all the good qualities that are to be found in even the devatas. All the good qualities. So therefore, Pariksit asked the perfect question of perfect questions, and Shikudai Goswami, who is the great and powerful personality, who knew the principles of religion, Dharmagya, he began his reply. That will come in the second canto of the first chapter, his reply, beginning of his reply.

The meaning of this fourth verse is, while the king was thus repenting, he received news of his imminent death, which would be due to the bite of a snake bird, occasioned by the curse spoken by the sage's son. The king accepted this as good news, for it would be the cause of his indifference toward worldly things.

**Key Quote:** "One can stop the repetition of birth and death only by going back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of material existence as a cycle of birth and death, contrasting it with spiritual existence and the possibility of returning to Godhead.

This suggests that the king was actually a very great devotee. He was realized sattva. He is welcoming this curse, which is going to be the cause of his death by the bite of a snake bird. So who would welcome death? It's our natural tendency to live on. Nobody wants to die. But here, Pariksit Maharaj, he is repenting, and he warns that the sinful action of his is counteracted by the appropriate punishment. And when he heard that he was cursed by the sage's son, he thought that this is the right punishment for me. And it's an extreme punishment. It's not a small punishment. But we will see Prabhupada explaining how the king accepted this particular news as good news. So in the purport, Prabhupada says, "Real happiness is achieved by spiritual existence or by cessation of the repetition of birth and death." So, spiritual happiness, material existence, is freedom from birth and death. And material existence is characterized by repetition of birth and death. One who is born, death is certain. And one who dies, rebirth is certain. So, this repetition of birth and death is the characteristic of material existence.

**Key Quote:** "One can stop the repetition of birth and death only by going back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'going back to Godhead' and mentions Srila Prabhupada's 'Back to Godhead' magazine, emphasizing that even attaining Brahma Loka doesn't free one from the cycle of birth and death.

One can stop the repetition of birth and death only by going back to Godhead. What does going back to Godhead mean? Going to the personal abode of Krishna, the Supreme Lord, God's own abode. It's called the Absolute, the Absolute pure within. Going back to Godhead. Srila Prabhupada started one magazine sometime in 1944 on the order of his spiritual master, and he gave the title for that magazine Back to Godhead. So, that magazine is particularly meant for all human beings, whose goal in life should be to stop the repetition of birth and death, and how can that be done? By going back to Godhead, by preparing oneself in such a way that at the end of this life, when we have to leave this body, we will not take another material body, but we will go to the spiritual kingdom of God in our spiritual body. Further, Srila Prabhupada explains, "In a material world, even by attaining the topmost planet, Brahma Loka, one cannot get rid of the conditions of repeated birth and death."

**Key Quote:** "Therefore those who are materially poverty are better candidates than those who are materially prosperous."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the limitations of even the highest material planets in escaping birth and death, highlighting the importance of detachment and the path of perfection, suggesting that material poverty can be an advantage.

This is the statement in the eighth chapter of the Bhagavad-Gita. It means we undergo repetition of birth and death. So beginning from the topmost planet, Brahma Loka, down to the lowest, Patala, all are places where repetition of birth and death takes place. Though there are different conditions on different planets, higher planets have a longer duration of life, there are better facilities for comfortable living, there is better arrangement for sense enjoyment, people are more pious in the upper planets, but still one cannot avoid a repetition of birth and death, even by going to the topmost planet in this material existence, that is Brahma Loka. So Prabhupada says, even if you go to Brahma Loka, we do not get freedom from birth and death. And knowing this, one should accept the path of attaining perfection. Generally, people don't take up this path of perfection of going back to Godhead. The path of perfection frees one from all material attachments, and thus one becomes fit to enter into the spiritual kingdom. See, there's a qualification: who can go to this spiritual kingdom of God? Those who are free from all material attachments. And the material attachments, we can become free only if we follow the path of perfection. Therefore, those who are materially poverty-stricken are better candidates than those who are materially prosperous. This is explained in many places in the scriptures.

### material prosperity, detachment, spiritual progress, curse as a blessing

**Key Quote:** "Material prosperity is like a fever."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of fever to explain that material prosperity is a diseased condition, emphasizing the need to detach from worldly affairs and highlighting how the curse on Pariksit Maharaj was a blessing in disguise, prompting him to renounce his kingdom and prepare for death.

Material prosperity is like a fever. Fever means the body, a healthy body, is in a diseased condition. So when somebody is diseased, they should cure the disease and return to the healthy condition, which is the normal condition. But instead of curing the disease and thereby reducing the fever, if somebody is doing things by which the fever keeps on increasing, then that is counterproductive. Similarly, material prosperity is like the diseased condition of human society. Why? Because in this material existence, we are not meant for making arrangements for living comfortably here or settling down in this place, no. This is certified as a place of suffering and misery under all circumstances. So therefore, we should endeavor to go back to God and prepare ourselves by becoming free from all material attachments. So materially poverty-stricken people, they never make arrangements, they cannot make arrangements for staying comfortable, because they are materially not prosperous. Maharaj Pariksit was a great devotee of the Lord and a bona fide candidate for entering into the kingdom of God. But even though he was so, his material assets as the emperor of the world were setbacks to perfect attainment of his rightful status as one of the associates of the Lord in the spiritual sky. If somebody is materially prosperous, there is a possibility that they have attachment for such material wealth or material belongings. In the course of dealing with this material world, we do develop attachments, and these attachments are impediments on the path of spiritual progress. As a devotee of the Lord, he could understand that the cursing of the brahmana boy, although unwise, was a blessing upon him. So how was this cursing the brahmana boy to die a blessing for Pariksit Maharaj? Because this curse would become the cause of detachment from worldly affairs, both political and social. Why? Because if he knows he is going to die within seven days, he is going to prepare for death by renouncing his kingdom and going to a sacred place to associate with saintly persons to prepare himself to become detached and go back to Godhead.

### Shamika Muni, Pariksit Maharaj, self-realization, detachment

**Key Quote:** "Both Shamika Muni and the king were self-realized souls."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Shamika Muni's role in conveying the news of the curse to King Pariksit, emphasizing that both were self-realized souls, not afraid of death, and that Pariksit Maharaj understood the situation and decided to prepare for his imminent death.

Now, Srila Prabhupada explains something very important here. Shamika Muni also, after regretting the incident, conveyed the news to the king as a matter of duty so that the king would be able to prepare himself to go back to Godhead. If you remember, in the previous chapter, it was explained that Shamika Rishi learnt that his son had cursed the king, the emperor. Just for a small fault of the emperor, this Shamika Rishi's son, Shungi, had cursed the king to die, which was not at all the proper punishment. For a very minor mistake, a severe punishment was given. It was unjust. It was improper, immature on the part of the boy. But still, he conveyed the news to the king so that the king could prepare. Shamika Muni sent news to the king that foolish Shungi, his son, misused his spiritual power by cursing the king unwarrantedly. Why did he say this? Because the incident of the king's garlanding the Muni was not sufficient cause for being cursed to death. But since there was no way to retract the curse, the king was informed to prepare for death within a week. Shamika Rishi is not an ordinary Muni, not an ordinary Brahmana. That will be explained by Srila Prabhupada here. Both Shamika Muni and the king were self-realized souls. Both were very, very advanced spiritually. Shamika Muni was a mystic. Mystic means he had practiced Ashtanga Yoga. So he was an Ashtanga Yogi. And Maharaj Pariksit was a devotee. Maharaj Pariksit had practiced Bhakti Yoga. So he was a Bhakti Yogi. Therefore, there was no difference between them in self-realization. Both were self-realized. That means they understood, they realized, I am not the body, I am spirit, soul. I don't belong to this material world. I belong to the Supreme Lord in the spiritual kingdom of God. Neither of them was afraid of meeting death. Shamika Rishi was not afraid of death, being self-realized. Neither Pariksit Maharaj was afraid of death, being also self-realized. Maharaj Pariksit could have gone to the Muni to beg his pardon. But the news of imminent death was conveyed to the king with so much regret by the Muni that the king did not want to shame the Muni further by his presence there. Pariksit Maharaj understood that Shamika Rishi has sent word to him that his son has foolishly cursed the king. Therefore, the punishment is, according to Pariksit Maharaj, proper. So no need to further go and beg any forgiveness from the Muni. He decided to prepare himself for his imminent death to find out the way to go back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "Loving devotional service to Krishna is the greatest achievement nothing else can compare with that"
**Summary:** The speaker introduces verse 5 of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Maharaj Pariksit's preparation for death through Krishna consciousness and renunciation of other self-realization practices.

In this session we will be discussing from the 5th verse of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: Atho Vihayemam Amum Chalokam Vimarshitau Heyataya Purastat Krishnangri Sevam Adhimanyamana Upavishatprayam Amartyanadyam. The meaning of this 5th verse is Maharaj Pariksit sat down firmly on the banks of the Ganges to concentrate his mind in Krishna consciousness, rejecting all other practices of self-realization, because transcendental loving service to Krishna is the greatest achievement, superseding all other methods. So this verse is directly describing what did Pariksit do to prepare for death, having got the news that he was cursed to die within a week by a snake bite. So he renounced his kingdom and he went to a sacred place on the bank of the river Ganga, sat down firmly to concentrate his mind in Krishna Consciousness. Why? Because he's a devotee and he knows that bhakti yoga is the best system for self-realization, so he rejected all of the practices of self-realization because he knew that loving devotional service to Krishna is the greatest achievement, nothing else can compare.

**Key Quote:** "For a devotee like Pariksit Maharaj none of the material planets even the topmost brahma loka is as desirable as Goloka Vrindavana"
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, contrasting the desires of a devotee (Goloka Vrindavana) with the limited understanding of material existence by modern scientists and philosophers, emphasizing the superiority of Krishna's abode.

With that, so in the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, for a devotee like Maharaj Pariksit, none of the material planets, even the topmost brahma loka, is as desirable as Goloka Vrindavana, the abode of Lord Sri Krishna, the primeval Lord and original personality of Godhead. This means a devotee like Pariksit Maharaj knows what is the nature of material existence. He is not ignorant like modern day people, even so-called learned scientists and philosophers. They do not know what is the nature of material existence. Sages do not know. They do not even know about the different varieties of planets in this material universe. So Srila Prabhupada explains here, for a devotee who is in knowledge, he knows that none of the material planets, including the topmost brahma loka, is a desirable place to transfer oneself to after quitting this body. So the best place, the most desirable place for a devotee is the personal abode of Shri Krishna which is called Goloka Vrindavana.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the vastness of the material creation, including innumerable universes and planets, and the insignificance of human beings within this scheme, while highlighting the importance of Goloka Vrindavana.

Goloka Vrindavana. Goloka eva nivasati akhilatma bhutaha govindam adipurusham tamaham bhajami. So several places in the scripture it is described Krishna's personal abode is called Goloka Vrindavana and that is the destination desired by pure devotees of Krishna like Parikshit Maharaj. Further Srila Prabhupada says this earth is one of the innumerable material planets within the universe. There are millions and billions of planets in this one universe and there are millions of universes within this material cosmic manifestation and the spiritual world is beyond all this. This the modern day scientists and philosophers and people do not know, they have no knowledge, they have no understanding, they have no idea. So the spiritual world is beyond all this. So, Srila Prabhupada says there are innumerable universes also within the compass of the Mahatattva. Mahatattva is the material creation, entirety of material creation is called Mahatattva. So, within this Mahatattva there are innumerable universes and each universe consists of innumerable planets and each planet consists of innumerable living beings. And among innumerable living beings in 84 lakh species, the human beings are one species of living beings, so very very very insignificant, human beings are insignificant in the scheme

But due to false ego, due to ignorance, due to being under the influence of illusion we think oh human beings are the greatest in the entire creation, no there are higher beings even within this universe and the topmost supreme personality is even beyond the material creation, the supreme lord, personality of God is Krishna of whom people do not have proper knowledge, proper understanding. So, Prabhupada is educating us by writing this elaborate purport. The devotees are told by the lord and his representatives, the spiritual masters or acharyas that not one of the planets within all the innumerable universes is suitable for the residential purposes of a devotee. These are all explained in the Bhagavad Gita, but you have to read Bhagavad Gita as explained by the Acharya. The bona fide Acharya Sri de Prabhupad, he has translated and given purport to Bhagavad

**Key Quote:** "The devotee always desires to go back home, back to Godhead just to become one of the associates of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the fundamental misery of material existence is the repetition of birth and death, and the best place for residence is the spiritual world, desiring to be an associate of the Lord.

Gita and he calls it Bhagavad Gita As It Is. Because in English language, before Prabhupadan wrote, nobody else had written the Bhagavad Gita to explain this fact that as the Lord explains in the Bhagavad Gita itself, all places are places of repetition of birth and death. And this is the fundamental misery of material existence, repetition of birth and death. That people do not know. And they also do not know that the best place for our residence is the kingdom of God in the spiritual world, personal kingdom of God. So, Prabhupada says the devotee always desires to go back home, back to Godhead just to become one of the associates of the Lord, in the capacity of servitor, friend, parent or conjugal lover of the Lord, either in one of the innumerable Vaikuntha planets or in Goloka Vrindavana, the planet of Lord Sri Krishna. So, this statement, it's being explained. There are many, many, many, many planets in the spiritual sky beyond the material creation.

**Key Quote:** "The planets in the spiritual sky, the Vaikuntha lokas and Goloka Vrindavana are eternally situated."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between Vaikuntha planets and Goloka Vrindavana in the spiritual sky, emphasizing their eternal nature compared to the temporary nature of material planets.

And those planets are of two categories. The Vaikuntha planets is one category of spiritual planets where the Supreme Lord as Narayana is residing with his devotees. And there is another planet called Goloka Vrindavana also in the spiritual sky where Lord Sri Krishna resides with his devotees. Narayana is four-handed Lord and Sri Krishna is two-handed Lord. But both are the supreme personality of Godhead in different forms. All these planets, that means Vaikuntha lokas and Goloka Vrindavana are eternally situated in the spiritual sky. The characteristic of material planets, whether Brahma loka or Indra loka, Chandra loka, Bhu loka, Patar loka, Sutala loka, all material planets are not eternal. Bhutva bhutva praliyate. They are constantly created, maintained and destroyed, including Brahma loka. And so are the living beings. The living beings are created, maintained and destroyed also. So the planets in the spiritual sky, the Vaikuntha lokas and Goloka Vrindavana are eternally situated. There is no creation, there is no destruction, there is no need for maintenance. That we have to understand, we have to realize, we have to accept.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the location of the spiritual sky beyond the causal ocean, highlighting the absence of misery and the presence of transcendental bliss, emphasizing the confidential nature of this knowledge.

We have to appreciate this fact. And where is the spiritual sky? It is on the other side of the causal ocean within the Mahat-tattva. Mahat-tattva is the entire material creation and this material creation is one side of an ocean called the causal ocean. It is called Karana Jala and the other side of the causal ocean is the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky, there are so many spiritual planets, eternally situated, no creation in the spiritual planets, no misery, no birth, no disease, no old age, no suffering, only pure transcendental bliss in association with Krishna or Narayana as one of his associates. So, this is very, very, very, very confidential knowledge Prabhupada is giving here. Maharaj Pariksit was already aware of all this information due to his accumulated piety and birth in a high family of devotees and Vaishnavas.

**Key Quote:** "Only the Vaishnavas, the pure devas, are able to promote themselves to higher planets in this universe."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vaishnavas' knowledge of the spiritual and material planets with the limited understanding of modern scientists, emphasizing that even the heavenly planets are still places of death.

Thus, he was not at all interested in material planets. This means to say, there are people who are conversant with the Vedas, which explain how one can promote oneself to higher planets in this universe, the heavenly planets particularly, where there is better, much better standard of living than on the earth planet, millions of times better. But even that place is a place of death. So therefore, only the Vaishnavas, the pure devas, are able to promote themselves to higher planets in this universe. They are devotees of the Supreme Lord Vishnu or Krishna. They have proper knowledge about the nature of all these material planets as opposed to the real nature of the spiritual planets, the Vaikunthalokas. So Maharaj Pariksit was a Vaishnava. So he knew all this, therefore, he was not interested in promoting himself to a material planet. Now Prabhupada compares the modern scientists, they are very eager to reach the moon planet or some other Mars planet. But they cannot conceive of the highest planet of this universe. They do not even know what are the conditions in Brahmaloka. But in contrast, Prabhupada says a devotee like Maharaj Pariksit does not care for any of these material planets, whether moon planet or Brahmaloka.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by describing Maharaj Pariksit's determination in transcendental loving service through fasting on the banks of the river Yamuna, clarifying a potential discrepancy with earlier mentions of the Ganges.

He does not care for any of these material planets, whether moon planet or Brahmaloka. So when he was assured that he is going to die within seven days, on a fixed date he was assured that he is going to die, he became determined in the transcendental loving service of Lord Krishna by complete fasting in the bank of the transcendental river Yamuna. Now earlier it was mentioned that Pariksit Maharaj was sitting down firmly on the bank of the Ganges. And here in the purport Shrita Prabhupada is telling Pariksit Maharaj sat down on the bank of the river Yamuna. So Prabhupada explains in a later purport, actually even though some places scriptures mention that Pariksit sat down on the bank of the river Ganga, but actually he sat down on the bank of the river Yamuna because Yamuna flows through the Ganges. So he sat down on the bank of the river Yamuna, Hastinapura which is the capital of the Delhi state. So he was ruling from Hastinapura, so he sat down on the bank of the Yamuna. Now this is explained better in the next verse. So we will hear about this more in the next verse. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces and translates verse 6, highlighting the purifying power of the Ganges and the necessity of taking shelter of it in preparation for death.

In this session, we will be discussing from the 6th verse of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Yavailasach Shri Tulasi Vimishra Krishnangri Renu Abhyadikambu Netri Punatiloka Nubhayatra Seshan Kastamna Sevet Marishyamanah. The meaning of this 6th verse is as follows: The river Ganges, by which the king sat to fast, carries the most auspicious water, which is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord and Tulasi leaves. Therefore, that water sanctifies the three worlds inside and outside, and even sanctifies Lord Shiva and other demigods. Consequently, everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore this verse is telling everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the glorification of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, emphasizing their purifying qualities and suitability as a shelter for those facing death.

So something about the glorification of this Amartana Dhyam, the transcendental river, on whose bank Parikshit was sitting to fast in order to prepare himself to go back to Godhead, to meet death, and thereby go back to Godhead. So what is the special thing about this river? That this river carries the most auspicious water. How is that? Because of two reasons. The water of this river, either Ganges or Yamuna, Ganga or Yamuna, is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, and it also contains Tulasi leaves. Now how is that? That is explained by Prabhupada in the purport. And because of this reason, the verse is telling, therefore this water of Ganges or Yamuna sanctifies the three worlds inside and outside, completely purifies all the three worlds. So whoever is the first one inside and outside of this world, and not only it purifies the three worlds, it purifies all the devatas including Lord Shiva. Shiva is the topmost among the devatas, so everyone becomes purified by coming in touch with this holy water of the Ganga or Yamuna. Therefore, this verse is telling everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.

**Key Quote:** "Maharaj Pariksit just after receiving the news of his death within seven days at once retired from family life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Parikshit Maharaj's immediate renunciation upon learning of his impending death and contrasts this with the traditional varnashrama system and its stages of life.

Either Ganga or Yamuna is the ideal shelter for those who are destined to die. So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, Maharaj Pariksit, just after receiving the news of his death within seven days, at once retired from family life. Time is very short, seven days, but he did not waste any time at all, at once retired from family life. Generally, in the varnashrama system, it is assumed that people live for 100 years, so there are four spiritual stages of development of spiritual perfection: brahmacharya, grahastha, vanaprastha, sanyas. So ideally, a person divides his hundred years into four parts, 25, 25, 25, 25. So first 25 years is the stage of brahmacharya, one practices brahmacharya, student life. Then in the next 25 years, the householder life, one gets married and raises the family. Then after that, at the age of 51, retires compulsorily and enters vanaprastha ashrama, means leaves home, pancha shoredwam vanam frajeth, goes to the forest. Forest means goes sacred place away from materialistic living, away from city, town, village, all that, away from that to a sacred place, to a holy place, to a place where saints live and exclusively practice spiritual life, vanaprastha. That is from 50th year up to 75th year and that is preparation for taking sanyas by renouncing all material connections 100%, and that sanya stage is from 75 to the 100th year. But we should also remember it is not guaranteed everybody will live 100.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Jiva Goswami statement appears to be more accurate because of the geographical situation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Srila Jiva Goswami suggests Parikshit Maharaj took shelter on the bank of the Yamuna rather than the Ganges, based on geographical considerations.

years, especially in this Kali Yuga, the duration of life in Kali Yuga shortened. Therefore, it is said here, everyone who is destined to die and who is not destined to die, everybody is destined to die. And who you do not believe, one said that all that situation will happen in the material world. In this video is broken and it will be and then what did he do? Shifted himself to the sacred bank of the river. Now again Prabhupada will explain why even though it was not for Gayatri opposition translation says Ganga river, Ganges, Amartyanadhyam, Transcendental river which is referred to as Ganga river. Here Prabhupada is telling in the purport Yamuna, it will be explained now. Generally it is said that the king took shelter on the bank of the Ganges, but according to Srila Jiva Goswami, one of the previous Acharyas who is the authority on Srimad Bhagavatam. According to Srila Jiva Goswami, the king Pariksit Maharaj took shelter on the bank of the Yamuna. Now Srila Prabhupada justifies why Srila Jiva Goswami says Pariksit Maharaj took shelter on the bank of river Yamuna and not Ganga. Srila Jiva Goswami statement appears to be more accurate because of the geographical situation. What is the geographical situation of Pariksit Maharaj? That Srila Prabhupada says Maharaj Pariksit resided in his capital Hastinapura situated near present Delhi and the river Yamuna flows down past the city of Delhi. Even now Yamuna is flowing. Comes from Himalayas, Yamunotri. Comes down and then flows through Delhi and later on flows through Vrindavan, Brajabhumi, Yamuna river. It divides Brajabhumi into two parts, the eastern side and the western side of the river Brajabhumi or Brajamandal. So, Prabhupada says naturally the king would take shelter of the river Yamuna because she was flowing past his palace door. His kingdom was situated in present-day Delhi and along Delhi, Yamuna is flowing. As far as sanctity is concerned.

Now about Lord Krishna Srila Prabhupada mentions here one interesting fact Lord Krishna sanctified the river Yamuna from the beginning of his transcendental pastimes in this world how is that while his father Vasudeva was crossing the Yamuna with the baby Lord Krishna what happened if you remember hearing or reading the birth of Krishna Krishna was born when Vasudeva and Devaki were imprisoned by Kamsa Krishna was the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva so when Krishna appeared Devaki and Vasudeva were very anxious to protect this baby child from the hands of Kamsa Kamsa Kamsa killed the first six sons of Devaki and therefore Devaki and Vasudeva were very anxious to save the eight child somehow from the clutches of Kamsa so Krishna being the supreme lord seeing the anxiety of Devaki and Vasudeva to protect him he directed Vasudeva you hide me in of Gokula in the house of Nanda maharaaj he carried baby krushna across the river Yamuna because on one side of river Yamuna is Mathura on the other side of river Yamuna across Yamuna the other side is Gokula 跟 Kulta was felt safe in the house of Nanda Maharaj you are not offhand, Kamsa's hands can't lay on me so Vasudeva agreed and he carried baby Krishna across the river Yamuna because on one side of river Yamuna is Mathura on the other side of river Yamuna across Yamuna the other side is Gokula, So what did this baby Krishna do to him it has been concluded someone told this was he died and then he haseping , the other-side this 100 earth person trek.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord fell down into the river Yamuna Krishna fell down and by the dust of his lotus feet the river at once became sanctified"
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Krishna's pastimes in the Yamuna, explaining how the river became sanctified by the dust of his lotus feet and the presence of Tulasi leaves.

And Vasudeva do he took that baby in a basket and cross the river Yamuna to safely hide the baby child Krishna in Gokula. So here the description is by Srila Prabhupada when Vasudeva was crossing with baby Krishna being carried on his head in a basket. What happened? The Lord fell down into the river Yamuna Krishna fell down and by the dust of his lotus feet the river at once became sanctified this is a pastime of Krishna remember Krishna is Supreme Lord he is not a small child. So Vasudeva was very anxious for the protection of Krishna so he became extremely anxious to protect Krishna when accidentally he thought the child had fallen. But actually Krishna was performing his Leela of sanctifying the river Yamuna by falling into the river so that his lotus feet touched the river. So therefore it is said here it is especially mentioned herein that Maharaj Pariksit took shelter of that particular river which is beautifully flowing carrying the dust of the lotus feet of Lord Krishna mixed with Tulasi leaves. Now how are dust of lotus feet of Krishna and Tulasi leaves both in Yamuna? We heard how dust of lotus feet of Krishna is in Yamuna because Krishna fell down into the river Yamuna when Vasudeva was crossing over. Now also Tulasi leaves are present in Yamuna because Lord Krishna's lotus feet are always besmeared with the Tulasi leaves. And thus as soon as the lotus feet contact the water of the Ganges in the Yamuna the rivers become at once sanctified. The Lord however contacted the river Yamuna more than the Ganges. Krishna performed his pastimes in Vrindavan on the bank of the Yamuna so he was more in contact with Yamuna than the Ganga. According to the Varaha Purana as quoted by Srila Jiva Goswami there is no difference between the water of Ganges and the Yamuna because both these waters are washing the lotus feet of the same Supreme Lord.

**Key Quote:** "There is no difference between the water of Ganges and the Yamuna because both these waters are washing the lotus feet of the same Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the origin of the Ganges and emphasizes the oneness of Ganga and Yamuna, as well as the ultimate oneness of Vishnu, Rama, and Krishna, before concluding the lecture.

What is the pastime of the river Ganga appearing in this world? When the Lord appeared incarnated as Vamana, he stretched his leg to measure three steps of land. When he stretched his leg, it pierced the coverings of the universe and the water of the Karna ocean leaked into this universe. It washed the feet of Lord Vaman Dev and that became the river Ganga which flows through all the planets from the topmost planet Brahmaloka to the bottom most Pataloka and purifies the entire universe by the sacred water because that water contains the dust of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Vaman Deva. So therefore Varaha Purana says there is no difference between Ganga and Yamuna. Both are washing the lotus feet of the same Supreme Lord whether Vamana or Krishna it is only one Supreme Lord. One and only one Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Ekameva Advita. Then it is called as Yamuna. So Prabhupada cites another statement from the scriptures. It is said in the scriptures that 1000 names of Vishnu equal to 1 name of Rama and 3 names of Rama are equal to 1 name of Krishna. So I will explain this some other time what is the difference between the names of Vishnu, Rama and Krishna. I will stop here. Thank you very much.

### liberation, detachment, Krishna's supremacy

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because Krishna alone can award liberation."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the meaning of the 7th verse, explaining Pariksit Maharaj's renunciation and his focus on Krishna for liberation, emphasizing Krishna's unique ability to grant Mukti.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet. In this session, we will be discussing from the 7th and 8th verses of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 7th verse first: Munivrata Mukta Samastha Sangaha. The meaning of this verse is: Thus the king, the worthy descendant of the Pandavas, decided once and for all and sat on the Ganges bank to fast until death and give himself up to the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, who alone is able to award liberation. So, freeing himself from all kinds of associations and attachments, he accepted the vows of a sage. There are many, many points in this verse. The verse itself is very nicely describing Pariksit renouncing his kingdom and deciding to prepare himself to quit his body within a week by fixing his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krishna. Why did he choose to fix his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krishna? Because Krishna alone can award liberation. That's why Krishna's another name is Munivrata. That's why Krishna's another name is Mukunda, one who can give Mukti, liberation. Even Lord Shiva admits, nobody else can give liberation. Mukti Pradata Sarveshaam Vishnureva Nasamshayaha. Shiva says nobody else can give liberation other than Vishnu. So Vishnu, Krishna, only they can give liberation. That is the supreme personality of Godhead. And in order to become liberated, one has to become free from all kinds of material association and material attachments. So Pariksit prepared himself by giving up all kinds of material association and material attachments.

### Vishnu Tattva, Krishna's forms, Supremacy of Krishna

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the fountainhead of the principle of Vishnu Tattva means Krishna is the source of all other incarnations, all other forms of the Supreme Lord."
**Summary:** This segment explains the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu, emphasizing Krishna as the source of all Vishnu forms and the unlimited nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

So, in the Sixth verse, Shrila Prabhupad explains the significance of Pariksit Maharaj retiring and going to a holy place on the bank of the sacred river Ganga. Shrila Prabhupada says in the Sixth verse, "The water of the Ganges sanctifies all the three worlds including the gods and the demigods because it emanates from the lotus feet, the personality of Godhead Vishnu." Lord Krishna is the fountainhead of the principle of Vishnu tattva, and therefore shelter of his lotus feet can deliver one from all sins including an offense committed by a king unto a Brahmana. Now here Srila Prabhupada explains what's the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu, actually they are one person called the principle of Vishnu tattva. You should understand that the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna is an unlimited personality, so he is not limited to one form. His original form is that of Krishna and he has many, many, many countless other forms which are forms of his own personality, like the form of Vishnu in this material world or the form of Narayana in the spiritual world or the form of Balarama, form of Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Keshava, Madhava, Govinda, unlimited forms because he is unlimited personality. He has unlimited forms, he is unlimited, but one should not mistake the form of the living being to be the form of the Lord, no, the form of the living being is never the form of the Lord. The living being is a very, very, very, very, very tiny living being, Anu Atma, and Krishna is Vibhu Atma. He is unlimited. He is a super soul and we are all individual, tiny, very, very infinitesimal spirit soul. So there is a difference. Both are spiritual by nature, the living entity and the Supreme Lord, but the Supreme Lord is unlimited person and we are limited, very, very, very, very tiny like comparing an atom to diamond. The whole universe, it's like that, the difference is like that. We can't measure how big is this universe. It's billions and trillions of times the size of an atom. So the living entity should never be equalized or even compared with the Supreme. So, Krishna is the fountainhead of the principle of Vishnu Tattva means Krishna is the source of all other incarnations, all other forms of the Supreme Lord. From Krishna emanate Narayana, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Vasudeva, Vishnu, and Vishnu. There are three forms of the Supreme. Keshava, Madhava, Govinda, all the Vishnu forms, all the Narayana forms, emanate from Krishna. That's the meaning of Krishna telling in the Bhagavad Gita, Aham sarvasya prabhavo matta sarvam pravartate.

### purification, Pariksit Maharaj, devotional service

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, Maharaj Pariksit began to meditate upon the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, who is Mukunda, or the giver of liberation."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Pariksit Maharaj's meditation on Krishna's lotus feet and the arrival of great sages, highlighting the importance of devotional service and the rarity of pure devotees.

So, it's said here, anyone who takes shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna becomes freed from all sins, including all offenses, accidentally committed, unknowingly committed, inadvertently committed. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, Maharaj Pariksit began to meditate upon the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, who is Mukunda, or the giver of liberation. Now, the bank of the Ganges or the bank of Yamuna can give a chance to a person to remember the Lord continuously. Therefore, Pariksit Maharaj decided to sit on the bank of the Ganga and meditate on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna to become free from all sins. Now, the eight words of the nineteenth chapter of the first canto, it is described. The meaning of this eighth verse is, at that time, when Pariksit Maharaj sat to fast until death, preparing himself for quitting the body, purifying himself, all the great minds and thinkers, accompanied by their disciples and sages, who could very sanctify a place of pilgrimage, just by their presence, they arrived there, where Pariksit Maharaj was sitting, for fasting and purifying himself. They arrived there on the plea of making a pilgrim's journey. Sushila Prabhupada explains this in the purport. When Maharaj Pariksit sat down on the bank of the Ganges, the news spread in all directions of the universe. It's a very, very, very great incident, because he was Hindu. He was a great devotee of the Lord. And he was the ideal emperor, ruling the whole earth planet. He was a very powerful king. He was a descendant of the Pandavas. Pandavas were pure devotees of Krishna. So was Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna, also a pure devotee of Krishna. So, when such a great personality dies, when such a great personality decides to renounce his kingdom, it is not a small incident. It even is important for the great personalities living in higher planets. The personalities of the higher planets know the aim of life is to purify oneself.

### pilgrimage, purification, Srimad Bhagavatam

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The absolute truth is the personality of Godhead Krishna and this can be realized only by those who follow the process of pure devotional service."
**Summary:** This segment explains why great sages visited Pariksit Maharaj, emphasizing their ability to purify places and their interest in hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam from Shukadeva Goswami.

And to prepare oneself to go back to Godhead. All the great personalities know this, but they are unable to themselves engage in a specific activity for complete 100% purification, because among them, different sages have different understanding of what is the best means for attaining the absolute truth. Because to understand what is the absolute truth is not at all easy if one simply studies the Vedas. It becomes different kinds of spiritual practices. The absolute truth is the personality of Godhead Krishna and this can be realized only by those who follow the process of pure devotional service. Such pure devotees are very, very, very rare in this whole universe, including the upper planets, including Brahma Loka, Mahar Loka, Jana Loka, Tapo Loka, including the heavenly planets. It is very rare to find a 100% pure devotee like Pariksit Maharaj, or it is very rare to find a 100% pure devotee like Shukadev Goswami. So when they receive news, Pariksit Maharaj is preparing to quit his body, they actually came to meet Pariksit Maharaj. But when they were asked, where are you going? Where are you traveling? They made an excuse that we are going to a holy place to take a bath to become purified. But what is their qualification? They themselves are personalities who can purify a place by their presence. They don't require to become purified. Neither they require to take a bath in a holy place. No. So the significance of such great personalities visiting a holy place is also described by Prabhupada. The places of pilgrimage become overburdened with the sins of common people. The common people go to a place of pilgrimage, take a bath, and they leave behind all their sinful reactions. So as millions of people go, let's say, a Kumbha Mela, so many millions of people go there to purify themselves by taking a bath at the auspicious time in the holy place of Prayag, Prayag Raj. So they leave behind all their sinful reactions. The holy places become overburdened with these sinful reactions of common people. But when such sages who are very, very powerful personalities, they visit overburdened places of pilgrimage, they sanctify the holy places by their mere presence. So the sages who came there, they were not interested in their own purification. They were already pure, but they came there to meet Maharaj Pariksit who was a great personality. Now they could foresee, Prabhupada says, that the Srimad Bhagavatam would be spoken by Shukadeva Goswami. Therefore they came there to hear the Bhagavatam spoken by Shukadeva Goswami, which was going to be spoken by Shukadeva Goswami to Maharaj Pariksit. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the weaknesses that even great personalities can exhibit due to material influence, emphasizing the importance of rectifying mistakes and avoiding bad association.

kidnapped. See even among great personalities, there is some weakness of enviousness, weakness of greed, weakness of pride. This is the nature of material existence you should understand. So, briefly Prabhupada is describing, he was born prematurely, Chavana is one of the six sons of his father Bhrigu Muni, great personalities, because of their practicing severe austerities, diligently studying the Vedic literature, cultivating spiritual knowledge, and living a very austere life, teaching this most important branch of knowledge, which is spiritual knowledge, Atmavidya, to other aspiring students, all these great works are done by these great sages. But, not all of them are always in this material world, living a pure life, sometimes overcome by some bad influence, or overcome by some weakness of the heart, they may make some mistake, they may commit some mistake. But, because they are great personalities, they immediately take steps to rectify their mistakes. That's the difference between great personalities and ordinary people. So, we should never show them disrespect, or ignore them, or neglect them, just because they commit a mistake, or they have done something wrong in the past because of some weakness, or because of being influenced by the overwhelming, overpowering material energy. So, it's a lesson for us, of course, we are very very ordinary persons compared to such great personalities. So, we are constantly subject to the influence of this most powerful material energy. And we often practice this in ourouls. So, we are constantly subject to the influence of this most powerful material energy. And we are prone to make mistakes again and again and again and again.

This Bhrigu Samhita is a great astrological treatise authored by Bhrigu Muni and it contains so many details about the science of astrology. This Bhrigu Muni is such a great personality. He explained how air, fire, water and earth are generated from ether. At the beginning of the creation, there is only the material energy in the inactive state. So when material energy is activated by the glance of Maha Vishnu, then material energy becomes activated and first of all there is a trap. He explains this and says that the will of the Father is an intensity of energy and there is a trap. So when material energy is activated by the glance of Maha Vishnu then material energy becomes transformation of Pradhana to Mahatatva. Mahatatva is the active principle of the material energy that Mahatatva transforms into false ego and false ego transforms into other elements like that how these elements get transformed and generated from one element another element is generated. So, from ether, ether is the first among the five elements to appear in the process of creation. So, from ether how air is generated, from air how fire is generated, how from fire water is generated and from water how earth is generated. This Brighumani

**Key Quote:** "Vasishta is the great celebrated sage among the brahmanas, well known as the Brahma Rishi."
**Summary:** This segment explains the different types of Rishis, focusing on Vasishta as a Brahma Rishi, and discusses the vast durations of the Yugas and the lifespans of great sages.

The historical details about the great sages, their personality, how they are such great personalities themselves. Vasishta. Vasishta is the great celebrated sage among the brahmanas, well known as the Brahma Rishi. Rishi means a sage. There are different kinds of rishis. Brahma rishi is a sage among the brahmanas. A deva rishi is a sage among the devatas, devas. Narada is a deva rishi. Vasishta is a Brahma rishi. Pariksit is a Raja rishi. He is a sage amongst great kings. Raja rishi. So like Pariksit is a Raja rishi, Narada is a deva rishi, Vasishta is a Brahma rishi. Now Vasishta is a prominent figure in both the Ramayana and Mahabharata periods. You should remember Ramayana is in Treta Yuga, historical narration of a history of the great incarnation of the Supreme Lord, Lord Rama. Mahabharata is the history of the Pandavas and Kauravas during the Dwapar Yuga, a later age. But still, such personalities as Brahma, Shiva, Vasishta, Bhrgumuni, they all live beyond the duration of one Yuga. A Yuga itself, this Kali Yuga, lasts 432,000 years according to the calculation of time on the Earth planet. So they live beyond even the four Yugas put together. The four Yugas, put together Sathya, Treta, Dwapara, Kali, each previous Yuga to the Kali Yuga is two times, three times, four times the duration of Kali Yuga.

**Key Quote:** "One day of Brahma is 1000 cycles of the four Yugas on the Earth planet."
**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on the duration of Yugas and the lifespan of great sages, emphasizing their presence in Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas, and their residence in the upper planets.

So the sum total of the four Yugas duration, Sathya, Treta, Dwapara, Kali, is 43 lakhs of years. 43 lakhs of years. That's 4 million, some 320,000 years. Millions of years. So even beyond that they live. They are all residents of the upper planets, where these planets are not destroyed at the end of Brahma's day. They live even beyond one day of Brahma. One day of Brahma is 1000 cycles of the four Yugas on the Earth planet. So they live beyond all this. So these great personalities, they appear in descriptions of the incidents in Ramayana. They appear in the descriptions of the incidents in Mahabharata. They appear in the descriptions of the Puranas. The Puranas are very ancient histories. They go back to the beginning of creation. They go back to the previous day of Brahma. Like that. So Vasishta Rishi is a prominent figure in both the Ramayana and Mahabharata periods. He celebrated the coronation ceremony of the personality of God Sri Rama.

**Summary:** This segment narrates the story of Lord Rama's exile, focusing on Kaikeyi's boons and Dasharatha's heartbreak.

Mahabharata periods, he celebrated the coronation ceremony of the personality of God Sri Rama. If you remember the description in Ramayana, Lord Rama appeared as a son of Dasharatha and one of the queens of Dasharatha, Kausalya, was his mother. So Rama was about to be enthroned. He was the eldest son of Dasharatha. He was about to be enthroned as the next king of Ayodhya, succeeding Dasharatha Maharaj. But the day before the coronation, Dasharatha's youngest queen, Kaikeyi, she asked him for two boons which he had promised to give her earlier. So the boon she asked, which Dasharatha had promised to fulfill, she asked that her son be coronated as the king of Ayodhya and not Rama. So Dasharatha had agreed to give her this boon, and every mother wants her own son to be the king. Okay. He agreed for that. But the second boon she asked was very, very, very heartbreaking. It shattered the heart of Dasharatha. The second boon she asked is not only that my son should be coronated as the king in place of Rama, but Rama should be in exile for 14 years from today, so that her son can establish himself as the king without any opposition from Rama.

**Summary:** This segment continues the Ramayana story, highlighting Rama's agreement to exile, Bharata's refusal to rule, and Rama's eventual coronation, also mentioning Vasishta's presence in Kurukshetra.

This was Kaikeyi's opinion. This was Kaikeyi's calculation. So Dasharatha was completely heartbroken. But nevertheless, he lived up to his promise. And when Rama came and inquired from Dasharatha, what is the cause for his grief, the day before his coronation, when Dasharatha said, I have given such a boon to Kaikeyi, two boons, and she's asking these two things. Rama readily agreed to keep the promise of his father intact. He readily agreed to Bharata, his younger stepbrother, being coronated as the king of Ayodhya to succeed Dasharatha. And he agreed to go to the forest and live in exile for 14 years, to keep his father's promise intact. This is the ideal son of his great father. So later on, after 14 years, when he came back, Bharata, of course, did not want to be the king. And he would not accept the position of the king of Ayodhya. He ruled on behalf of Rama. And when Rama returned after exile, he handed over charge of ruling the kingdom to Rama. Rama was coronated as the king of Ayodhya after he returned from exile. And Vasishta was present in that coronation ceremony of Lord Rama. He was also present on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. After Treta Yuga, the Dwapara Yuga began and towards the end of Dwapara Yuga there was the battle of Kurukshetra. So Vasishta was present during the battle of Kurukshetra.

**Summary:** This segment discusses Vasishta's greatness and long lifespan, acknowledging the weaknesses of even great sages, and emphasizing the rarity of pure devotees.

He could approach all the higher and lower planets and his name is also connected to the history of Hiranyakashipu. Hiranyakashipu was in Sakhi Yuga. So this Vasishta is a very, very great personality and he has a very, very long duration of life. All these sages, great sages, they have a very long duration of life. There was a great tension between him, that is Vasishta, and Vishwamitra. There was a quarrel between Vasishta and Shabu. As I said in the previous session, they are great personalities, Vasishta, Vishwamitra, Bhrigu Muni, Bharadwaja, but they do have some weakness. They do have some weakness. Now as I said earlier and repeating, because of their weakness we should not disrespect them or we should not look down upon them. You should understand that this material world is a very, very difficult place to live and to find somebody who is spotless in character, who is completely free from all defects and weaknesses is extremely rare. And who is such a personality, who is completely free from all defects? It is, one is the Supreme Lord himself, who is eternally pure, eternally full of all good qualities, and his pure devotees like Narada, the Pandavas, Pariksit Maharaj, Shukadeva Goswami. So these personalities who are pure devotees are very, very, very, very, very rare.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the extreme rarity of pure devotees in the universe, highlighting the fortune of encountering Srila Prabhupada.

This is described in the Bhagavatam, how rare are pure devotees in this whole universe. I am forgetting that words. It says that among the millions and billions of liberated souls and perfected beings, it is very, very rare to find one pure devotee of the Supreme Lord Narayana. That is what the Bhagavatam says. So don't think that it is very easy to find a pure devotee in the entire universe. In the entire universe it is difficult to find a pure devotee. So given that kind of knowledge, understanding, we can just imagine how we are fortunate to come in touch with Srila Prabhupada, the pure devotee in our age, our time. Very, very rare, such pure devotees on the level of Narada, Shukadeva Goswami, the Pandavas, Pariksit Maharaj.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the greatness of personalities like Vasishta, despite their imperfections, and narrates the story of the quarrel between Vasishta and Vishwamitra over the Kamadhenu cow.

On their level, to find a pure devotee is very, very difficult. Nevertheless, those who are not pure devotees but are very, very great personalities compared to common people, compared to even the Devatas, just like Vasishta Rishi. He is a very, very great personality, though he is not 100% free from all defects still. Because of some weakness, there was a quarrel between Vasishta and Vishwamitra. What happened? Vasishta had one wish-fulfilling cow called Kamadhenu. And Vishwamitra while visiting Vasishta noticed that Vasishta has that Kamadhenu. So he wanted that Kamadhenu. Vasishta Muni refused to spare his Kamadhenu. And Vishwamitra, he killed 100 sons of Vasishta because Vasishta refused to give him the Kamadhenu, because Vishwamitra was a powerful king. So like this, there was some quarrel between them. But both of them nevertheless are great personalities. They have their own greatness, great qualities in themselves. So we will discuss more in the next session.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of Parikshit Maharaj's preparation for death and emphasizes the importance of Krishna consciousness for attaining eternal life.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam Deveem Saraswateem Vyasam Tato Jayam Udi Rayet Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Chai Vanarottamam In this session, we will continue to discuss from the same two verses, verses 9 and 10 of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. These two verses list the names of some of the great sages who were visiting the place where Pariksit Maharaj decided to sit down on the bank of the river Ganga and fast unto death, preparing himself for quitting the body in one week's time. So these great saintly persons from the upper planets of the universe, they could understand the importance of this event of Pariksit Maharaj quitting his body because he was a first class devotee, a great devotee, pure devotee of the Lord. Therefore, his quitting the body is instructive for everyone all over the universe. That is the greatest test we have to face in life: how to be prepared to quit this body or how to face death in such a way that we don't enter another body, material body. That is the greatest test, but instead, if we are situated in right consciousness, like Parikshit Maharaj was, then we don't take another birth after we leave this body, which is what happens at a time of death. We leave this body, and if we are ready, we are prepared, we are situated in the right consciousness. What is that right consciousness? That is Krishna consciousness, situated in devotional service to Krishna, situated in bhakti, then we straight go to Krishna's personal abode for eternal life full of bliss and knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "But a pure devotee like Parikshit Maharaj has the guarantee that he is going back to Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the position of a pure devotee with that of materially powerful beings, highlighting the devotee's assurance of returning to Godhead.

In association with Krishna. So, that is what the confidential portions of the Vedas describe to us. So, these great personalities, they know how important it is to actually prepare oneself to quit the body, to leave the body at the time of death, in the right consciousness. So, they are anxious, they are eager to learn by witnessing the passing away of such great personality as Parikshit Maharaj. So, by this you can also estimate what is the position of a pure devotee in the entire universe. Parikshit Maharaj, by virtue of his birth in a family of great kings, Kshatriya family, Pandavas, Pandava family, he was entitled to become the emperor of the entire world, this earth planet. But, compared to the position of an emperor of this earth planet, there are many many great personalities or greater personalities in other higher parts of the universe who have much better power, much more power, much better position, much greater duration of life, bodily beauty and facilities for material enjoyment and lot of knowledge. And, they also have a lot of good aristocratic society in which they live, etc. The Devatas, the Rishis, the Siddhas, the Charanas, the Vidyadharas, the Kinnaras and so many different grades of higher beings in the upper planets up to Brahma Loka, but none of them are actually, by virtue of their actual material position, none of them are free from death, none of them are, by virtue of their material position, in a proper situation to face death so that they don't take birth again and go back to godhead. None of them have that assurance simply by virtue of their position as some great devata or great jnani, tapasvi, yogi, brahma rishi, raja rishi, deva rishi, none of them have this assurance or guarantee, but a pure devotee like Parikshit Maharaj has the guarantee that he is going back to godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker outlines the simple method of Krishna consciousness, emphasizing chanting, hearing Srimad Bhagavatam, and following the teachings of Srila Rupa Goswami.

But a pure devotee like Parikshit Maharaj has the guarantee that he is going back to godhead when he quits this body because of his being 100% Krishna conscious before even quitting the body. So therefore, the scriptures say simply practice devotional service, become a pure devotee and go back to godhead at the end of this very life. Scriptures describe you have to wait for millions of births before you even become liberated from material bondage, but a devotee does not endeavor for freedom from material bondage separately like the other practitioners of different other yoga systems or other spiritual recommendations do. A devotee does not endeavor like that. A devotee simply is engaged in devotion, authorized devotional service. What is authorized devotional service in this Kali Yuga? It is to practice chanting and hearing of the name, holy name of Krishna, particularly the Harikrishna Mahamantra and also supplement it with hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam or reading or studying the Srimad Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita, associated with devotees, accept the simple principles of sadhana bhakti as taught by Sri La Rupa Goswami, one of our previous acharyas, the direct disciple of Sri Chaitanya Maha Prabhu. Simply accept this easy method of Krishna consciousness and prepare yourself to go back to God. Now let us hear.

**Key Quote:** "Let me associate with them, take their good advice and accordingly follow their instructions to prepare myself to attain self-realization."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Parikshit Maharaj being cursed and his subsequent decision to renounce his kingdom and prepare for death.

Sri La Prabhupada describing the personality of the great sages, some of the great sages who assembled in that saintly assembly of great persons where Pariksit Maharaj had retired after renouncing his Indian religion, his kingdom in order to prepare himself to go back to godhead at the end of seven days when he was due to die due to a snake bite, due to a curse by the son of a brahmana, a sage Shamika Rishi. Shamika Rishi's son, feeling that his father was insulted by Pariksit, he cursed Pariksit to die within seven days by his snake bite because his father was insulted by Pariksit taking a dead snake and putting it around the shoulder of his father who was sitting in meditation completely in trance, unaware of the external surroundings. So Pariksit accepted the curse because he was an intelligent king. He knew he has to die someday sooner or later. Let me now accept this notice of death which has come of its own accord by higher arrangement of providence or, as devotees understand, by arrangement of Krishna, the Supreme Personality caught in the ultimate controller of providence itself. So let me accept that opportunity that I now have seven days to prepare myself being exclusively dedicated for such preparation by completely renouncing my kingdom, my family, my wealth, my material connections, everything material and simply sitting down on the bank of the Ganga and associating with saintly persons who naturally live in such holy places, themselves being engaged in spiritual activities meant exclusively for self-realization. So let me associate with them, take their good advice and accordingly follow their instructions to prepare myself to attain self-realization. This was Pariksit Maharaj.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces Parashara Muni, describing his lineage and relationship to other prominent sages.

This was Pariksit Maharaj's plan. So yes, at the previous session we heard about Vasishta. Now let us hear about another great sage, Parashara Muni. So it is described by Srila Prabhupada, Parashara Muni was the grandson of Vasishta Muni, sorry we should not talk in the past because these are all great personalities who live a very very long life span, running over several yugas, several thousands of yuga cycles. So Srila Prabhupada says he is the grandson of Vasishta Muni and he is the father of Vyasadeva. All these personalities are still living in the universe. Parashara Muni is the son of Maharshi Shakti and his mother's name was Adrisha. That means he was born in the past but he is still living. He was in the womb of his mother when she was only 12 years old. Those days there was a child marriage. Now child marriage is decried in modern age but actually those days it was understood that child marriage is the most conducive for marriage. It is called as a spiritual advancement.

**Key Quote:** "Child marriage is the most conducive for marriage...It is called as a spiritual advancement."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the historical context of child marriage and its perceived benefits for spiritual advancement and harmonious family life.

It is called as a spiritual advancement. Why? Because the parents understand that their children have to be properly established in Grahastha ashrama so that they can live peacefully together without unnecessarily having some distress and so many misunderstandings etc. So two good families they agree to marry their son and daughter and thereby the marriage is fixed when the boy and girl are young, in fact too young, but the actual marriage take place when they come of age and then they are trained up how to live as husband and wife, how to have a nice family, how to cooperate with each other for spiritual advancement and for living harmoniously while in this material body for each other's spiritual benefit. This is the training that is given and such a life is a very

glorious life, human form of life properly utilized. So in the womb of his mother he learned the Vedas and it is described here his father was killed by a demon named Kalmashapada and to avenge this death of his father he wanted to annihilate the whole world because he was a very powerful sage, he could have done that, but he was restrained by his grandfather Vasishta. He then performed a rakshasa killing yagna. He decided, "Oh, I'm not going to destroy the whole world, I'm going to kill these rakshasas who are demons who are meant for simply giving trouble to innocent saintly persons." But Maharshi Pulastya restrained him. You see how this wholesale killing is not at all proper. Somebody has to be punished specifically for the specific mistake or crime or sin he has done, but that punishment should be commensurate with the particular activity. So Parashara Muni is famous for begetting Vyasa Deva. He begot Vyasareva in the womb of one Satyavati. Satyavati later on became the wife of Maharaja Santanu and Satyavati's sons were Vichitravirya and Chitra Virya. Vichitravirya became the emperor of the world after Santanu Maharaja and Vichitravirya's sons were Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura. Vasishta, sorry, I am sorry. Parashara Muni was present also during the time of Bhishma's death. He was also the spiritual master of Maharaj Janaka. He is the author of many Vedic scriptures in sociological directions. So that is about Parashara Muni. I will stop here.

Now, an adult has more physical strength than a small child, but among different adults, different adults have different degrees of physical strength. Now, when you compare the physical strength of a human being on this earth to the physical strength of a woman heavenly devata, then the devata will have many, many, many times more physical strength than the human beings. Of course, when I say physical strength, the devatas don't have a physical body. I mean the strength, material strength, the bodily strength possessed due to material position. So, devatas have many times more power, more strength, more knowledge, more intelligence, more beauty, more wealth, more facilities, longer duration of life than humans on the earth.

So, the mystic power possessed by great sages who are living in the topmost planets like Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Satyaloka, the topmost planets in this universe, they have a very, very, very long duration of life. Some of them have a duration of life as much that of Brahma himself. Some live for several kalpas. A kalpa is a day of Brahma, which is 1000 cycle of four yugas on the earth planet. 1000 cycle of four yugas is something like four billion years on the earth. So, there are saintly persons whose duration of life is four billion years. We can't even imagine how long the duration of life they live, but still a long duration of life does not mean that they are free from the material conditions of birth and death, the material miseries of birth and death. That is never absent even in the topmost planet called Brahma loka. So, there is always the fear of death even for Lord Brahma, what to speak of others. So, the duration of life is fantastically long, but still they have to face death, and for that they have to be prepared. So, they are always anxious how to actually leave this body at the time of death so as to be able to go back to Godhead, become free from the repetition of birth and death in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "The way the universe is made is that our necessities are supplied according to the system of sacrifice that is carried out by the different human beings in different parts of this world and different parts of the universe"
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Vishwamitra's quarrel with Vasishta over the Kamadhenu cow, explaining the importance of sacrifice for universal welfare.

He picked a quarrel with Vasishta Muni when he was a Kshatriya king. It is described briefly in the description under Vasishta. You would have heard this in a previous session, that Vasishta was having one kamadhenu, one special cow which would give as much milk as one desires whenever one desires to have milk, that's a kamadhenu. And Vasishta was using that milk given by kamadhenu, the cow, special cow, for his performing daily sacrifice. Sacrifice means one has to offer huge quantities of ghee in a sacrificial fire. Of course, the kind of sacrifice one does, there are varieties of sacrifice one can do as recommended in scriptures. So, if one performs a fire sacrifice, one requires several ingredients of which the most important ingredient for a fire sacrifice is a cow ghee. So, such cow ghee is obtained by taking the milk of a cow and then turning that milk into yogurt or curds, dahi, and churning that dahi to get butter and heating that butter to make it into ghee, wonderful properties and qualities. So, such huge quantities of ghee are required for performing a fire sacrifice, especially the saintly persons, the sages, they perform fire sacrifice for the sake of universal welfare. See, the way the universe is made is that our necessities are supplied according to the system of sacrifice that is carried out by the different human beings in different parts of this world and different parts of the universe. So, the more the sacrifice that is performed, the better the supply of necessities for the different

living entities in this material world by mother nature. So, Vasishta Muni was having the kamadhenu and this Vishwamitra as the king was visiting, was going to the forest, and he happened to come to the ashram of Vasishta Muni, and he was received very nicely by Vasishta Muni, given a grand reception. So, he was curious, how is this saintly person living in the forest able to give me a grand reception? While of course, I am a king, I am very pleased with the reception I have received, but what is the source of wealth by which he has given such a grand reception? So, he found out this, that Vasishtamuni had a kamadhenu. So, when he learned that Vasishtamuni had a kamadhenu, he became very much desirous of getting such a kamadhenu. Now, such kamadhenu is not available anywhere and everywhere. So, he decided that he is going to take away that kamadhenu from Vasishta, and that is how a quarrel began. So, therefore, Srila Prabhupada says he picked up a quarrel with Vasishtamuni when he was a Kshatriya king because Vasishtamuni, he requires that cow for his sacrifice, but this Vishwamitra forcibly took it away, and then there was a big fight and so many things happened, and some details are given elsewhere, but it is just mentioned that when he realized his mistake, Vishwamitra then he decided to retire from his kingly position.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Vishwamitra's severe austerities, his failure to control his senses leading to the birth of Shakuntala, and Indra's attempt to distract him with Menaka.

And he decided to perform austerities to purify himself of all the reactions. So, he began very severe austerities and he also performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Matangamuni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasishta. He became a great yogi and yet, he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of Shakuntala, the beauty queen of world history. So, he actually fathered a child, Shakuntala daughter, who was raised by one Kanva Rishi, when Indra sent Menaka from the heavenly planet, from Apsara, to distract this Vishwamitra Rishi when he was performing severe tapasya, because Indra is afraid of somebody else taking away his position as the king of heaven. So, when somebody is performing tapasya to accumulate Punya, they automatically accumulate Punya when they perform tapasya. So, Indra is afraid that somebody else will exceed his Punya, Indra's Punya and take away his position. So, he tries to distract them from performing tapasya. So, he sends this Apsaras who will entice such saintly persons or sages to give up their performing the tapasya and simply enjoy life with the Apsara. So, Menaka came and Vishwamitra did get distracted by Menaka and later on he realized that he was distracted because of Menaka's enticing him and he gave up Menaka and Menaka's company and continued his tapasya.

**Key Quote:** "So from his mind Narada is born and Angira is also a Rishi who is born from Brahma's mind."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the roles of Vishnu and Brahma in creation, and introduces Angira Rishi and his connection to Brahma and Brihaspati.

We are discussing the different sages who visited Pariksit Maharaj's temple. So, these are the verses. Pariksit Maharaj's... These are some of the six Tiya. Here she goes. universe at the beginning of creation so brahma is born on a lotus flower that emanates from Garbhodakashayi Vishnu Padmanabha. Vishnu Padmanabha, he is called Padmanabha. This Vishnu is called Padmanabha because from his navel one lotus flower comes out and on that lotus flower Brahma is born. So, Brahma is also called Padmaja, one who is born on a lotus flower. He is the first created being. He is created directly by Vishnu because at the beginning of creation there is no one else other than Vishnu in this material world. Of course, in the spiritual world which is eternal, Supreme Lord and all his expansions, his devotees, eternal devotees, everyone is there always, but in the material world it is always created by Vishnu. So, Brahma is also called Padmanabha, created, maintained and destroyed. So, at the time of creation first of all Brahma is born among the living beings who have to take birth again because they are not liberated in the previous previous time of destruction of this material world. Those who are not liberated, they are lying in a dormant condition in the material energy, mahat tattva. So, then they are again given birth, given bodies, given birth means given bodies by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord called creation. So, creation two things happen. One is creating the material diversities or the varieties from the material energy in terms of the elements, earth, water, fire, air, sky and then the different planets and the varieties of living conditions on the planets, the rivers, the mountains, the forests, etc, etc, all that. All the places of inhabitation of the living entities have to be first created. And that is done by Garbhodakashayi Vishnu. He creates the different diversities in this material world. Then Brahma is born from Vishnu and Brahma creates the first of the different state, the Prajapatis from his mind, from his different parts of the body. So from his mind Narada is born and Angira is also a Rishi who is born from Brahma's mind. So therefore Angira Rishi is described as Manasa Putra, mental son of Brahma at the beginning of creation and Narada is another Manasa Putra, the son of Brahma. And Angira is also described as the father of Brihaspati, the great learned priest of the demigods in the heavenly planets. Brihaspati is another great sage. He is the learned priest of the Devatas that means he advises the king of heaven Indra on all religious matters, spiritual matters. He advises King Indra as well as the Devatas. Angira was born of the

There are crores of holy places. How many? Crores of holy places. Koti, Koti, Koti. In fact, it is not an exaggeration if we say every spot in the Himalayas is actually a holy place. That is the significance of the Himalayan mountains. That is why this tract of land which is having Himalayas to the north and ocean or seas on the three other sides is actually a very special tract of land. It is a very special tract of land. It is the most holy land on the entire earth planet. This what we now call as India, the most holy place. And among the different holy places, maximum number of holy places are concentrated in the Himalayan mountains. So in those Himalayan mountains, there are many many many millions and billions of saintly persons. Most of them we cannot see with these eyes. We cannot see with these eyes even if you visit the Himalayas because they are present there in subtle body. And what are they doing generally? Saintly persons live in holy places performing spiritual tapasya, spiritual activities, engaged in meditation, engaged in worshipping the Supreme Lord, engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord, engaged in spiritual activities. That is the purpose of a saintly person residing in a holy place.

Next there is a description of Parashurama. He is the son of Maharishi Jamadagni and Srimati Renuka. He is also known as Renuka Sutta by his mother's name, Renuka Sutta, the son of Renuka. He is one of the powerful incarnations of God. In the Dasha Avatara Stotra his name is mentioned as one of the Lila Avataras, past time incarnations of the Lord. As a past time what did he do? He killed the Kshatriya community as a whole twenty one times. He went round the earth planet when the earth was overburdened by Kshatriyas who were posing as kings, but they were actually very very puffed up with power and they were not properly ruling in a righteous way. They were exploiting, they were exploiting the citizens. So Parashurama became very angry at these Kshatriyas and he decided to clean up the earth planet, get rid of such Kshatriyas and therefore he killed them completely, almost completely by going round the earth twenty one times. He just had one Parashu. He is called Parashurama. His name is Parashurama, but he is, he is named as Parashurama because there are three Ramas mentioned in the Dashavatarasthotra. All three incarnations are known as Rama, but depending on the specific quality or characteristic they are distinguished. The first Rama mentioned is Parashurama, the son of Maharshi Jamadagni and Renuka. He is having a, a weapon called Parashu. Parashu means an axe. Axe as a weapon. With that one Parashu, one axe, he went round simply chopping off the heads of all these miscreant Kshatriyas. He went round the world and simply killed all these Kshatriyas.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the discussion on Parashurama, explaining that despite his divine status, he performed austerities to teach the importance of non-violence, and that being killed by the Lord leads to liberation.

So this Parshurama, he killed the Kshatriya community as old 21 times. With the blood of the Kshatriyas he pleased the souls of his forefathers. Later on this is at the Mahendra Parvata because he wanted to teach, even though his killing the Kshatriya was justified, but still the killing business is very very sinful activity. Killing is sinful. So in order to teach us that killing is not good, so he himself underwent severe austerities in order to free himself from the sin of killing so many millions of Kshatriyas. Actually there is no sin on his part because he himself is the incarnational Supreme Lord. So there is no sin because whoever he kills will be liberated, will be purified. Being killed by God one becomes liberated, purified of all sinful reactions. So there is no sin on the part of the Supreme Lord when the Supreme Lord kills any person in this world. So it is a favor done by the Supreme Lord upon a soul, a sinful soul because by killing that sinful soul the Supreme Lord will put an end to that person's sinful activity and also purify him of sinful reactions and also liberate him from this material bondage. So there is more description. We will hear more about Parchurama in another session.

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naram Jai Vanarottamam Devim Sarasvatim Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayet. In this session, we will be discussing the 9th and 10th verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a continuation of the discussion of the same two verses which we have done in the past five sessions. We completed part 5 of the discussion of these two verses because it is a long purport. So, this session will be part 6 of these two verses which we will be discussing. These two verses are listing the great sages who arrived from different parts of the universe to witness the great emperor Mahabhagavata, pure devotee Parikshit Maharaj, put his body in perfect Krishna consciousness. So, this quitting the body, which means when death comes, we have to leave the body. We means each one of us is spirit, spirit soul. So, we have to leave the body and we have to leave this body. So, one in knowledge is able to face death perfectly by understanding that time has come to leave this body and move on. So, in that sense, life is a journey, so it's a journey we have undertaken in order to reach a final destination, just like you travel, whenever you travel, you have a certain destination you want to reach. Exactly like that, if life is understood to be a journey, then our destination should be Krishna's personal abode. In the Bhagavad-Gita, and several places including the verse I just cited, Krishna says his abode, personal abode, is such a place having gone where we will never come back to this material world. So, ultimately liberation means to fix our destination as Krishna's personal abode and travel this spiritual path which leads us to that specific destination, Krishna Krishna Krishna dhama, Goloka dhama.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the suffering inherent in material existence with the blissful nature of the spiritual world, highlighting the cycle of birth, death, disease, and old age in the material realm.

There are so many different planets in the material world and in the spiritual world, but of all the places, none of the planets in the material world, even though some of them belonging to the upper planetary system have millions of times better material facilities than what we have on the earth, none of them are suitable for a person who knows the nature of material existence, that he can be omnipresent. The existence of the known meaning is not only the ability of the existence of users of man and species, no matter the age, even if you might say that biology numbers are repeated, what can be said about personality or aspiration is simply this is a wise to deadly list of material existences. Material life means, material existence means, anudarshanam, repeatedly we experience these four things, whether Brahmaloka or Maharloka or some Tapoloka, Siddhaloka, Bhuloka, Patarloka, every place in this material creation, in this material universe, in this material world, is a place of repeated birth, disease, old age and death, whereas the spiritual world is that place where there is no misery, no birth, no death, no disease, no old age, no suffering, no scarcity, no deterioration.

They are learned, they studied the Vedas, they are engaged in severe austerities, they have a long duration of life, they have millions of times better facilities on the upper planets than what we have on the earth, but still they also know that when time comes to quit the body, we should be prepared to leave this body and straight go to Krishna's personal abode.

And why did he undergo this penance? To teach us that ultimately the killing business is not a very good business, even though Lord Parshurama is justified, but as a saintly person it is not his business to do this killing, but the killing is also good for those who are the miscreant Kshatriyas, that when they are killed to bring a eternal life and death coming to them can feel good.

**Key Quote:** "the Supreme Lord's mercy upon them is shown when the Lord kills them purifies them and actually liberates them from sinful reactions"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Parshurama's actions, though involving killing, were acts of mercy that purified and liberated the miscreants from their sinful reactions.

By the Supreme Lord or his incarnation or his pure devotee, then the person who is killed actually becomes purified of all sinful reactions because they are miscreants, they have done so many sinful activities, but the Supreme Lord's mercy upon them is shown when the Lord kills them, purifies them, and actually liberates them from sinful reactions. So, therefore, Parshurama's action is never to be mistaken to be some kind of sinful activity he is doing, no, but in order to teach us that this killing business is not very good like a ordinary person, at the end of his life he may undergo severe austerity to atone for his sins committed in the past. Similarly, Parshurama underwent severe penances at the Mahindra Parvatha and after taking the whole earth from the Kshatriyas, he gave it in charity to Kashyapa Muni. He freed the earth from the misrule, misconduct of the twin Kshatriyas and gave it away to Kashyapa Muni. Actually, the earth planet, not only earth planet, the entire creation belongs to the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how everything belongs to Krishna and how devotees take responsibility to guide others, mentioning Parshurama giving the earth in charity and instructing Dronacharya in military science.

Everything belongs to Krishna, but on behalf of Krishna, they take responsibility of carrying out their duties of guiding the people how to live in this world, how to maintain oneself with the minimum needs of the body, at the same time cultivate Krishna consciousness and prepare oneself to ultimately go back to Godhead. So, Parashurama is instructing us by performing the severe penances and after he has become free from all reactions by the atonement through the recommended method of this shastra, he gave away the earth planet because he had conquered. He is the rightful owner. But he gave it away to Kashyapa Muni. Next, it is said Parashurama instructed the Dhanurveda or the science of fighting to Dronacharya because Dronacharya happened to be a Brahmana. Parashurama was a Brahmana, he was a teacher. Because he was expert in military science, he taught that military science to Dronacharya. And Dronacharya is described in the Mahabharata as, Parshurama said to Dronacharya,

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Parshurama's presence at Yudhishthira's coronation and emphasizes the importance of righteous leaders following Krishna's instructions for the benefit of the world.

In this session we continue to discuss from the 9th and 10th verses of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We were discussing in the previous session about Parshurama. So Parshurama has been described as a brahmana who was expert in the military science, Dhanurveda. Therefore he taught that military science to Dronacharya who further instructed that military science to the Pandavas and Kauravas. So it is described Parshurama was present during the coronation of Mahabharata, Maharaja Yudhishthira, and he celebrated the function along with other great rishis. The saintly persons know very well that the Pandavas are the righteous persons to rule the world, not the Kauravas, especially Duryodhana. It is described in the Bhagavad Gita, He was wicked, crooked minded, evil minded. So he was not the fit person to rule Duryodhana. So therefore the Pandavas, in order to obey the instructions of Krishna that righteous people should rule this world, then only the people will be guided properly and will actually rule this world. They will actually benefit from the rule of such righteous persons like Maharaja Yudhishthira. So Parshurama celebrated the function of coronation of Maharaja Yudhishthira after the battle of Kurukshetra along with other great sages.

### time scales, respect for devotees, Krishna's perspective

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says you should respect them more than what respect you offer to me."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the different time scales on different planets and emphasizes the importance of respecting Krishna's devotees, even more than Krishna himself.

The sages are always there to advise, instruct, guide the Kshatriya kings. Now Srila Prabhupada says, Parshurama is so old that he met both Rama and Krishna at different times. He is a very, very old personality. Several millions of years they lived, because their time scale is different from the time scale that we are subject to on this earth planet. To give an example, Brahma's one day consists of a day and a night. A complete cycle of a day and a night of Brahma is something like two thousand cycles of our four yugas. That is Brahma's day and night. So that comes to some 8 billions of years. So 8 billions of years is Brahma's just one day and night. So the time scale on different planets is different than the time scale of Brahma. The time scale of different planets is different. So, Parashurama is a resident of a higher planet. So, he doesn't, his body doesn't follow the time cycle, time scale of this earth planet. So, his life span will be very, very, very, very long. It is described that he fought with Rama, that is Lord Ramachandra, but he accepted Krishna as a Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also praised Arjuna when he saw Arjuna with Krishna, because Arjuna is a celebrated devotee of Krishna. If Krishna is respected as a Supreme Personality of Godhead, definitely one must also offer respect to Krishna, respect to Krishna's pure devotees like Arjuna. Because if somebody commits an offense at Krishna's lotus feet, one may beg forgiveness from Krishna and Krishna will pardon very easily. But if somebody offends Krishna's pure devotee, Krishna will never forgive, never pardon. Even if you ask Krishna forgiveness, Krishna will not pardon. So, therefore, it is very important to respect not only Krishna, but Krishna's pure devotees also, and they should be offered as much respect as we offer to Krishna. In fact, Krishna says the opposite. He says, as far as my devotees are concerned, you should not just respect them as much as you respect me. Krishna says you should respect them more than what respect you offer to me.

**Key Quote:** "My devotee is more worshipable than me."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's statement that His devotees are more worshipable than Him and highlights the exalted position of the spiritual master and Parshurama's glorification of Arjuna.

Krishna says in the eleventh category of Bhagavatam while instructing Uddhava, madbhakta puja abhyadhika. What does it mean? My devotee is more worshipable than me. So Krishna is thoroughly pleased if we worship Krishna's devotee and show respect more than what we show to Krishna. Of course, one should not do that, that you disrespect Krishna or show some disregard to Krishna. It should never be done. But nevertheless, a devotee should be respected. Devotee should be respected at least as much as we offer respect to Krishna, because Krishna is supremely worshipable, a devotee is also supremely worshipable. A pure devotee of Krishna is more worshipable than all the demigods put together. In the eleventh canto, Krishna says, acharya mambhijaniya sarva-devamayo guruhu. That is spiritual master is described as acharya and guru in this particular verse, and Krishna says, the acharya or the spiritual, bona fide spiritual master is non-different from me, and he is to be respected as the sum total of all the demigods. So he is very, very exalted position. So Parshurama actually glorified Arjuna. He not only glorified Krishna, but he also glorified Arjuna, the pure devotee of Krishna.

### Bhishma's vow, Parshurama's order, battle between Bhishma and Parshurama

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So then both of them fought very severely, Bhishma and Parshurama."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Amba, Bhishma, and Parshurama, focusing on Bhishma's refusal to marry Amba due to his vow of celibacy and the subsequent battle between Bhishma and Parshurama.

Then further Srila Prabhupada says, when Bhishma refused to marry Amba, who wanted him to become her husband, Amba met Parshurama. See the history is given in the Mahabharata that Bhishma wanted to arrange the marriage of his step-brother, Vijitravirya. So in order to get a suitable princess to marry this prince, Vijitravirya, the son of Satyavati and Shantanu, so Bhishma arranged that he went to some place where some princesses were about to be married, and he kidnapped them and brought them to be married to Vijitravirya. Of the three princesses, Amba, Ambika and Ambalika, two of them were married to Vijitravirya. But Amba refused to marry Vijitravirya. Amba's argument was that Bhishma has kidnapped her. So she wanted to marry Bhishma. But Bhishma refused to marry Amba because he had taken a vow that he is going to remain a Brahmachari, a celibate, rest of his life. So he refused to marry Amba. And then Amba insisted that she is not going to marry Vijitravirya, that is Bhishma's stepbrother, but she only wants to marry Bhishma. So when Bhishma refused, then Amba went to Parshurama and requested him to force Bhishma to marry her. So then Parshurama asked Bhishma, you should marry Amba because she has been kidnapped by you, and then as a chaste woman, she will not accept anybody else as her husband other than the one who has kidnapped her. So when Bhishma refused to obey the order of Parshurama, because Bhishma had learned the military science from Parshurama, so Parshurama was one of the gurus of Bhishma, spiritual masters. So Parshurama, as the spiritual master, he ordered Bhishma, you should marry Amba. But Bhishma refused because he had taken a vow of celibacy. So then both of them fought very severely, Bhishma and Parshurama. And at last Parshurama was pleased with Bhishma because Bhishma fought very valiantly and he was the disciple. So the teacher is thoroughly pleased when the disciple, having learned the military science, actually displaced the courage, valour and the skill in fighting to the teacher. Then Bhishma, when Parshurama was pleased with Bhishma, then he gave Bhishma the benediction of becoming the greatest fighter in the entire world. During this time, Bhishma was the greatest warrior.

### Utatya's story, Varuna's offense, misuse of mystic power

**Key Quote:** "Varuna, in order to satisfy his own desire to enjoy that beautiful woman, he kidnapped this wife of the great sage Uthathya, and to retaliate this offense of Varuna, Uthathya, he drank all the water of the world."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Utatya, his wife Bhadra, and Varuna, highlighting Varuna's offense of kidnapping Bhadra and Utatya's reaction of drinking all the water in the world, questioning the proper use of mystic power.

So that much about Parshurama. Then the next sage being described here is Utatya, one of the three sons of Maharshi Angira. He was a spiritual master of Maharaj Mandhata. He married Bhadra, the daughter of Soma or the moon god. Varuna kidnapped his wife, and he made her the wife of Maharaja and her son. Varuna said to him, Lord, you know, I am a great warrior but you will not be able to match me in this game, or I will not be able to match your mother, so I will not be able to match your father. You will not be able to match my mother. After all, the daughter of Soma was very beautiful. Varuna, the daughter of Maharshi Angira, did not know who she was. However, Varuna, in order to satisfy his own desire to enjoy that beautiful woman, he kidnapped this wife of the great sage Uthathya, and to retaliate this offense of Varuna, Uthathya, he drank all the water of the world. Varuna is the controller of water bodies, but the water bodies on this earth planet were completely emptied by this Uthathya. They have so much of mystic power, yogic power, by their severe austerities, but sometimes they don't use it properly. This is not a proper use of the mystic power to take revenge against another devata, because that devata did some mistake. So, like this, there is sometimes some altercation or some quarrel or some kind of, later on, things are settled by the superiors of these personalities. Sometimes Brahma intervenes, sometimes Shiva intervenes, sometimes Vishnu himself intervenes. When the devatas were supposed to be ideal in their character and behavior, and they are controlled in their senses, and they carry out the administration on behalf of Vishnu, they are empowered personalities to rule the world, the creation, the whole universe, but sometimes they are carried away by the influence of one of the gunas, the lower modes, Rajoguna, Tamoguna.

**Key Quote:** "So the demoniac qualities are described in 16th chapter of Bhagavad Gita so you can study those demoniac qualities they never listen to others"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how even devatas and great sages can make mistakes and be corrected by superiors, contrasting this with the incorrigible nature of demons who can only be purified through being killed by the Lord or His devotees.

And that is when the intervention of the elderly personalities is actually meant to correct these mistakes that even such a devata or great sages do. And when they're corrected, of course, they become, they come to their senses and they access to the human body, their fault and they stand corrected. But the demons, they never can be corrected. They can never be collected because their demonic mentality is such that they never think they are wrong and they don't care for the superior instructions of greater personalities, of great sages or saintly persons or Vishnu himself. They don't listen to others. They're too proud, they're too puffed up, they're too arrogant. So the demoniac qualities are described in 16th chapter of Bhagavad Gita. So you can study those demoniac qualities. They never listen to others. They are never remorseful about the mistakes they do or the sins they come to. It so therefore sometimes the only way they can be purified is when the Supreme Lord or his pure devotee or an incarnation of the Lord kills them and purifies them. That's the only way they can be purified. So I'll stop here, thank you.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the Vedic system where rulers are guided by learned sages who provide advice and instruction without seeking material benefit, exemplified by Medha Tithi, an assembly member of Indra Deva.

In this session, we continue to discuss from the 9th and 10th verses of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is part 8 of the discussion. This is the last session in which we will complete the discussion on these two verses. So we are discussing different sages who appeared there. Srila Prabhupada has given a brief biography of these sages. So the first chapter of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the next sage, Medha Tithi, an old sage of yore, an assembly member of the heavenly king Indra Deva. These devatas, they are always guided by great saintly persons. This is the system. Any ruler, any king, any responsible person in the administration is always guided by learned sages who never occupy the post of ruling or controlling or doing administration, but are well-versed in the science. So they give advice, they instruct, they guide, but they never accept any salary, they never take any remuneration. They don't expect any material benefit out of that. They are doing it as a seva, as a service. So this Medha Tithi was an assembly member of the heavenly king Indra Deva. His son was Kanvamuni, another great sage.

**Key Quote:** "Following the Vanashrama Dharma is very, very beneficial for elevation to the higher status in life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how following the Vanashrama Dharma leads to gradual elevation through different planetary systems, contrasting it with the direct path of Bhakti Yoga.

This Kanvamuni brought up Shakuntala in the forest. And Shakuntala was left behind by Menaka. This Medha Tithi was promoted to the heavenly planet by strictly following the principles of retired life or vanaprastha. Following the Vanashrama Dharma is very, very beneficial for elevation to the higher status in life. Of course, the ultimate goal of such elevation is to come to the point of achieving ultimate liberation by going back to Godhead. But those who adopt the gradual process of elevation of consciousness, they have to gradually go from the earth planet to the heavenly planet to the still higher planet, still higher planet, still higher planet. Bhūloka, Bhūvarloka, Svarloka or Svargaloka. Bhūloka, Bhūvarloka, Svargaloka or Svargaloka. Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Satyaloka.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the direct path of Bhakti Yoga, which leads to immediate liberation, with other gradual processes like Jnana, Karma, and various Yoga systems, emphasizing the importance of a spiritual master.

This is step-by-step elevation. But the Bhakti Yoga process is directly go back to Godhead by completely concentrating one's attention on Krishna alone. This is explained by Krishna in the 8th chapter, that one who remembers me alone at the time of death, such a person when he quits the body, he directly attains shelter at my lotus feet in my personal abode. He is directly transformed to Krishna's personal abode. So, those who don't know about this Bhakti Yoga process, or those who are not having the guidance of the spiritual master or master as the laity, master who is expert in Bhakti Yoga, such people have to follow the gradual process of elevation, the other process of Jnana, Karma, Ashtanga Yoga, Hatha Yoga, so many other, Sankhi Yoga, so many other yoga systems are there for the gradual process of elevation.

Next, Devala, a great authority like Narada Muni and Vyasa Deva, his good name is on the list of authorities mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna, when he acknowledges Krishna's position as a supreme Brahman, Arjuna is saying that Krishna is accepted as a supreme Brahman, the supreme personality of Godhead, by many great saintly persons who are authorities in Vedic knowledge. Narada, the foremost authority. Then, Asita Devala Vyasa, so Devala's name is mentioned as one of the authorities by Arjuna who all acknowledge Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of Gautama Rishi as one of the Saptarishis and clarifies the two types of descendants within the Gautama gotra: family descendants (Brahmins) and those in disciplic succession (Kshatriyas and Vaishyas).

Next, Gautama, one of the seven great sages of the universe. In every universe, there is a position of Saptarishis. They are elevated to that post, they have their own planet in the upper part of the universe, Saptarishi Mandala. It's called Saptarishi Mandala. And Gautama Rishi is one of the Saptarishis. Sharadwaan Gautama was one of his sons. Now, Srila Prabhupada clarifies one very important point. Persons in the Gautama gotra today are either his family descendants or in his disciplic succession. Like those in the Vedic culture, they say, to which gotra do you belong? To which lineage? Lineage of ancestors. So, those belonging to Gautama gotra, generally a rishi's name is associated with the gotra. Gotra means this descendant of a particular sage. So, two kinds of descendants: those who are family descendants are the brahmanas. Just like Gautama Rishi, he had his sons and his sons had their sons, their sons, their sons, their sons. Like that in the brahmana lineage, present day brahmanas who are actually Gautama gotra descendants, they are coming from the Gautama Rishi himself as the descendants. And those who are Kshatriyas and Vaishyas who claim to be of Gautama gotra, they generally are having Gautama Rishi as their priest, as their preceptor, as their guide and saintly teacher. So, two kinds of descendants, those in the disciplic succession who follow Gautama Rishi

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Ahalya, the wife of Gautama Rishi, who was molested by Indra and turned into stone, later delivered by Lord Ramachandra, also mentioning Gautama's connection to Kripacharya.

and those who are family descendants, seminal descendants and the descendants who are having the spiritual guidance given by Gautama Rishi. Gautama Rishi was the husband of the famous Ahalya. Ahalya is a personality who was delivered by Rama or Ramachandra. So, it is described here that Ahalya turned into a stone when Indradeva, the king of heaven, molested her. You see, among the devatas, there is always this enviousness because there is so much material desires for enjoyment. Sometimes they become envious. Ahalya was the wife of Gautama Rishi. But because Indra wanted to enjoy with her, because she is a chaste lady, she will refuse to satisfy Indra. This is the instruction in the scriptures that another's wife should be respected on the level of one's mother. So, there is a question of enjoying. So, similarly, Indradeva, he should not have even approached the wife of Gautama Ahalya even though she might have been very beautiful. But he nevertheless approached her. When she refused, he molested her. He forced her. So, then she, by her chastity, she turned into a stone so that Indra could no longer do any more harm to her. And then she was delivered by Rama. When Rama touched her, she was delivered. When Rama was in exile, Ahalya was delivered by Lord Ramachandra. Gautama was the grandfather of Kripacharya who was one of the heroes of the battle of Kurukshetra.

Kripacharya was fighting on the side of the Kauravas. But Kripacharya was the brother-in-law of Dronacharya. Kripacharya's twin sister married Dronacharya. So, Dronacharya's wife's brother is Kripacharya. So, Kripacharya did not die in the battle of Kurukshetra, even though he was fighting on the side of the Kauravas. So, later on, Kripacharya actually became the guide for Yudhishthira. There was no enmity as such. They would fight on one side or the other side. There was no enmity actually. So, Kripacharya agreed to become the, because he was a very learned sage, so he became the guide for Yudhishthira after Yudhishthira was coronated as the emperor of the world after the battle of Kurukshetra. So, Kripacharya's illustrious lineage is Kripacharya's grandfather was Gautama Rishi, the great Gautama Rishi.

**Key Quote:** "You have to hear from a Self-realized soul. That is the only way and there is no other way."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Maitreya Rishi as the spiritual master of Vidura, emphasizing the importance of hearing from a self-realized soul to acquire Brahmavidya and highlighting the parampara system of knowledge transmission.

Then the last sage being described here is Maitreya Rishi, a great Rishi of yoga. He was the spiritual master of Vidura. In fact, most of the Bhagavatam, a good portion of the Bhagavatam is describing the conversation between Vidura and Maitreya, which is cited by Shukadeva Goswami. When Shukadeva Goswami was speaking the Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj, to answer some of Pariksit's questions, Shukadeva Goswami would cite a similar question was asked by someone else in the past. This is called parampara system. Nobody has to manufacture any answer for any question. The entire body of spiritual knowledge is descending from Krishna. Krishna first instructed Brahma, Brahma instructed Narada, Narada instructed Vyasa, Vyasa instructed Deja. Shukadeva Goswami and other personalities. So Vidura inquired from Maitreya Rishi when on pilgrimage. He met Maitreya Rishi in Badrikashram. And he inquired from Maitreya Rishi. Of course, Vidura himself is enlightened and learned, pure devotee, Mahabhagavata. He is one of the Mahajanas. But in order to teach us how we have to make inquiries from the right authority, from the right source, we have to acquire this knowledge of the Self, Brahmavidya. You cannot study Brahmavidya or become knowledgeable in the Brahmavidya simply by studying books, simply by doing some meditation and all that. You have to hear from a Self-realized soul. That is the only way and there is no other way. There is no substitute for that. So Vidura heard from Maitreya who was Self-realized. And that conversation is elaborately described in the later cantos of the Bhagavad Gita. So Maitreya Rishi is famous as the one who instructed Vidura in this spiritual subject matter, Brahmavidya.

Maitreya advised Dhritarashtra to keep good relations with the Pandavas. And Dhritarashtra was plotting and planning to kill the Pandavas. Actually, Dhritarashtra was not planning to kill the Pandavas. It was Duryodhana who wanted to kill the Pandavas. So Dhritarashtra, instead of stopping his sons from attempting to kill the Pandavas, he supported his sons. That is when the others intervened. Like Maitreya Rishi, he advised Dhritarashtra not to ill-treat the Pandavas because Dhritarashtra was a caretaker, so not to ill-treat his brother's sons, his nephews, but rather to keep good relations. Duryodhana disagreed and thus Maitreya Rishi cursed Duryodhana. Maitreya also met Vyasadeva and had religious discourses with Vyasadeva.

Jayananda Prabhu was always engaged, after coming in touch with Prabhupada, in devotional service as Prabhupada instructed him. Towards the end of his life, when he realized he had cancer, he knew that very soon he was going to die, quit his body. He did not want to take treatment in the hospital, but he came back to the temple and he requested devotees to help him to always remember Krishna. He diverted his mind away from the pain and the complications of the disease towards hearing and chanting about Krishna, about the holy name of Krishna, all of the pastimes of Krishna, and engaging with devotees in the temple.

### Varaha incarnation, purpose of incarnation, divine power

**Key Quote:** "There cannot be any incarnation without a particular function. Every incarnation has got a very specific function and such functions are always extraordinary."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami explains the significance of Lord Varaha's incarnation, citing a verse from the Bhagavatam and emphasizing the Lord's extraordinary power in lifting the Earth and the specific purpose behind each incarnation.

Today is the most auspicious appearance day of Lord Varahadeva, a very extraordinary incarnation of the Lord in the form of a transcendental boar incarnation. I will be reciting a verse from the Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam contains a nice description of Lord Varahadeva's appearance and pastimes. The first canto, third chapter, entitled Krishna is the source of all incarnations. In this chapter, there is a description of the Varaha incarnation in the seventh verse: Dviteeyam tu bhavayasya Dviteeyam tu bhavayasya Dviteeyam tu bhavayasya Dviteeyam tu bhavayasya Rasatala Gatam Mahim Uddharshan Upadatta Yajnesha Savukaram Vapuhu. The meaning of this verse is, "The supreme enjoyer of all sacrifices, Yajnesha, accepted the incarnation of a boar, Savukaram Vapuhu, the second incarnation, Dviteeyam tu, and for the welfare of the earth, He lifted the earth from the nether regions of the universe." So in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains regarding this appearance of the Lord as a boar. The indication is that for each and every incarnation of the personality of Godhead, the particular function executed is also mentioned. So this verse says, why did the Lord appear as Varaha? To lift the earth from the lower regions of the universe. There cannot be any incarnation of the Lord to lift the earth from the lower regions of the universe. There cannot be any incarnation without a particular function. Every incarnation has got a very specific function and such functions are always extraordinary. Lifting the entire earth planet out of the depths of the Garbhodaka ocean simply by lifting it on the snout. You can imagine how big the Varaha form of the Lord would have been simply to support the earth between the two tusks on the snout and lift it effortlessly as a Leela and place it back perfectly in the orbit. That is what the Lord did. So, such a Leela. Extraordinary activities are impossible for any living being to perform. This is very important. That nobody else can do it. No yogi, no jnani, no karmi, no devata, no asura. Nobody can do it. The incarnation of the Bohr was to take the earth out of Pluto's region of filthy matter, the bottom of the universe. From there, the earth was to be lifted up. Picking up something from a filthy place is done by a Bohr. And the all-powerful personality of Godhead displayed this wonder to the asuras who had hidden the earth in such a filthy place.

**Key Quote:** "The form of the Lord is always transcendental."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Hiranyaksha's role in hiding the Earth and emphasizes the transcendental nature of the Lord's form, even as a boar, distinguishing it from material forms.

Particularly the asura by name Hiranyaksha. He had hidden the earth in the filthy place. And the earth is the place of residence for the human beings and many other varieties of living entities. But at the beginning of this Manvantara, when the earth was to be populated, then the earth itself was in the bottom of the Garbhodaka ocean, Garbha ocean. So to pick it up was required because the earth is the place of residence for so many living beings in different life forms. There is nothing impossible for the personality of Godhead. And although he played the part of a Bohr, by the devotees he is worshipped. Nobody worships a hog. But the Lord, when he appears in this particular form, he is always worshipable in all forms because all forms are transcendental. We should never think that this form of the Lord as Bohr is similar to the Bohr form in this material world. No. The form of the Lord is always transcendental. It is very beautiful. It is very very extraordinary. So devotees worship the Lord even in the form of Bohr. And the Lord is always staying in transcendence. He always remains in the spiritual platform. He never becomes affected by the material nature. He never is influenced by material nature. On the other hand, he is always the controller of material nature. And he remains the Supreme Lord under all circumstances, eternally, always, in any form he may appear.

### scheduled incarnations, Brahma's words, demons vs. demigods

**Key Quote:** "Only under certain conditions do the planets float as weightless balls in the air."
**Summary:** The lecture moves to a description from the second canto, highlighting Brahma's perspective on the Varaha incarnation and the eternal conflict between demons and demigods.

Just for the sake of his Leela, he assumes different forms. Then, in one more place, in the second canto, seventh chapter, which describes the scheduled incarnations, the first words are spoken by Brahma: yathrodhyata shiti taloddharanaya vibhrat kraudim tanum sakalayajnamayim anantah antar maharnava upagatam adhidaityam tam damstraya adhrim iva vajradharo dadhara. The meaning of this verse is, Lord Brahma is speaking, when the unlimitedly powerful Lord assumed the form of a Bohr as a pastime, just to lift the planet Earth, which was drowned in the great ocean of the universe called the Garbhodaka. The first demon, Hiranyaksha, appeared and the Lord pierced him with his tusk. This Hiranyaksha had hidden the Earth in the bottom of the Garbhodaka ocean. So the Lord came to lift this Earth. And when Hiranyaksha prevented the Lord from rescuing the Earth, then there was a fight between the Lord, Lord Varaha and Hiranyaksha. And Hiranyaksha was delivered simply by the Lord piercing with his tusk, Hiranyaksha's huge powerful body. So in the purport to this verse, Srila Prabhupada says, since the beginning of creation, the demons and demigods or the Vaishnavas are always two classes of living beings to dominate the planets of the universe. The demons, Asuras and Suras. Sura means the Devatas. They are all Vaishnavas. They are all Vishnubhakta. Vishnubhakta spruto daiva. That is the definition. So among the Devatas, Lord Brahma is the first Devata. And among the demons in this universe, Hiranyaksha is the first demon in this universe. Brahma and Hiranyaksha.

### planetary balance, modern exploitation, Hiranyaksha's mischief

**Key Quote:** "So this disturbance by modern demons can result in a greatly harmful reaction to the floating condition of the earth."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami discusses the delicate balance of the planets, warning against modern exploitation of resources and drawing parallels to Hiranyaksha's disruptive actions.

The first Devata and the first Asura. Only under certain conditions do the planets float as weightless balls in the air. The planets are gigantic bodies. They float in the air only under specific conditions. And as soon as these conditions are disturbed, the planets may fall down in the Garbhodaka ocean, which covers half the universe. The universe is like a huge shell. And half the shell is covered by water called Garbhodaka ocean. And the planets are above. That is what is explained here. The other half is a spherical dome, within which the innumerable planetary systems exist. The floating of the planets in the weightless air is due to the inner constitution of the globes. And the modernized drilling of the earth to exploit oil from within is a sort of disturbance by the modern demons. So much oil exploration is going on. So much oil is being taken out of the earth. But then it does disturb the conditions under which the earth is floating in the atmosphere. So this disturbance by modern demons can result in a greatly harmful reaction to the floating condition of the earth. So it is not humanly possible. Neither it is possible by any Devata or anybody else other than the Supreme Lord to maintain this balance of the earth remaining in the atmosphere above the Garbhodaka ocean. And the earth also moving in its orbit perfectly. That is facilitated by the Lord. A similar disturbance created formerly by the demons headed by Hiranyaksha. Hiranyaksha is described to be the great exploiter of the gold rush. It means he was, Hiranya means gold. So he was interested in gold. Why? Because Asuras want to enjoy unlimitedly, sense gratification. And they require huge amounts of money for that. Therefore this Hiranyaksha was always after gold. And therefore he is called Hiranyaksha, the exploiter of the gold rush. And the earth was detached from its weightless condition and fell down into the Garbhodaka ocean due to the mischief of this Asura, Hiranyaksha. The Lord as maintainer of the whole creation of the material world therefore assumed the gigantic form of a boar with a proportionate snout and picked up the earth from the water of the Garbhodaka. The Lord went inside the water and picked up the earth from the bottom of the Garbhodaka ocean.

### Jayadev Goswami, Dasavatara Stotra, incarnation symptoms

**Key Quote:** "The incarnation of the Lord is not the concocted idea of fanciful men who create an incarnation out of imagination."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Jayadev Goswami's Dasavatara Stotra, emphasizing the unique and extraordinary circumstances surrounding the Lord's incarnations, contrasting them with imagined or concocted forms.

Sri Jayadev Goswami, the great Vaishnava poet, has sung as follows. Jayadev Goswami has written a song called Dasavatara Stotra. In that Dasavatara Stotra, the third verse describes the incarnation of the Lord as Varaha: Vasati dashana shikhare dharanitava lagna Shashini kalanka kaleva nimagna Kesava drita shukara roopa jaya jagadishahare. This is the third verse sung by Jayadev Goswami in glorification of Supreme Lord. Jayadev Goswami says, O Keshava, O Supreme Lord, who assumed the form of a boar, O Lord, the planet earth rested on your tusks and it appeared like the moon engraved with spots. So here is a comparison. When the Lord lifted the earth, the earth was resting on his tusks, then the Lord appeared very very beautiful. Shashini kalanka kaleva nimagna. So therefore Srila Prabhupada says, Such is the symptom of an incarnation of the Lord. The incarnation of the Lord is not the concocted idea of fanciful men who create an incarnation out of imagination. The incarnation of the Lord appears under certain extraordinary circumstances, like the above mentioned occasion. Above mentioned occasion is when there was a need for the Lord to annihilate this demon Hiranyaksha. Then the Lord appears as Varaha and he kills this demon Hiranyaksha. The incarnation performs a task which is not even imaginable by the tiny brain of mankind. We have all got brains, but it is beyond our comprehension how the Lord can appear in the form of a boar or Varaha. How he can perform so many pious activities. We cannot imagine what all the kind of activities he performs. Extraordinary, extraordinary. But for him all activities are leela, pastimes. There is no exertion on his part because he is unlimitedly powerful. The modern creators of the many cheap incarnations may take note of the factual incarnation of God as a gigantic boar. So these modern people who think that they can concoct some idea about Varaha in their own way. No, that is not Varaha. Varaha is the specific form of the Lord who is incarnated in order to bless the people of this world.

**Key Quote:** "Varaha is the specific form of the Lord who is incarnated in order to bless the people of this world."
**Summary:** HH Stoka Krishna Swami reiterates the specific form and purpose of the Varaha incarnation, highlighting Hiranyaksha's attempts to disrupt the Lord's mission and Brahma's initial contemplation on the situation.

So that Varaha incarnation not simply appeared but actually lifted the earth with a suitable snout to carry the planet earth. He appeared. So this is the description of Lord Varaha lifting the earth in two different verses. Now it is also described here when the Lord appeared to pick up the earth the demon of the name Hiranyakya tried to create a disturbance in the methodical functions of the Lord and therefore he was killed by being placed by being pierced, I am sorry, he was killed by being pierced by the tusk of Lord Varaha. Now in the Bhagavatam third canto there is another description of the appearance of Varaha. Here in the third canto it is mentioned in the 14th chapter it is described that the Lord appeared as Varaha for a specific purpose to lift the earth. Now how did the earth fall down into the water? So it is said here one two different reasons are given in this narration. The the creator Brahma he thought while I have been engaged in the process of creation the earth has been inundated by deluge. Inundated means flooded. By what? By what? A flood. There was a flood and has gone down into the depths of the ocean. It has gone down to the depths of the ocean. What can we do who are engaged in this matter of creation? When a Devata or a devotee has got a problem naturally they turn towards the Supreme Lord Krishna for solving their problem. So similarly Brahma is praying to Krishna. So he is telling it is best to let the Almighty Lord direct us. Krishna is seated in our heart. He gives us knowledge. He gives remembrance. He gives us forgetfulness. So when he directs a devotee it need not be that he has to only personally do that. No. He can do it personally because he is seated in everyone's heart as Paramatma. But he also empowers somebody else to do this work. So in accordance with the Lord's empowerment certain devotees certain great saintly persons they perform extraordinary activities. So when Brahma was thinking like this suddenly a small form of bores came out of his nostril. The measurement of this creature which came out of the nostril of Brahma was as small as the upper portion of a thumb. Upper portion of a thumb.

**Key Quote:** "Is he the supreme personality of God and Vishnu?"
**Summary:** The lecture describes Brahma's astonishment at the sudden appearance and growth of the Varaha form, leading to his recognition of Vishnu and the subsequent chanting of Vedic hymns by sages.

Very very small. While Brahma was observing him the bore became situated in the sky. Bore became situated in the sky. And the bore was appearing as a as gigantic as a great elephant. It is small when it was born. But it became big like a huge elephant. Now struck with wonder at observing the wonderful bore like form in the sky Brahma along with other Brahmanas like Marichi as well as the Kumaras and Manu began to argue began to argue in various ways. He argued that who is this who has come in the pretence of a bore. So Brahma says is this some extraordinary entity come in the pretence of a bore? It is very wonderful that he has come from God and as a result of this the the empowered person can do something which may appear to be like an extraordinary thing. But actually even an empowered person cannot do anything extraordinary like God that is not possible for us. So God only has to do it. So first of all this bore was seen to be no bigger than the tip of the thumb and within a moment he was as large as a stone. My mind is perturbed. Is he the supreme personality of God and Vishnu? See Brahma is not like the bore. Therefore immediately Brahma was not able to recognize but he came to know that this could be Vishnu. So while Brahma was deliberating with his sons the supreme Lord who appeared as the bore in the form of a mountain he roared very loudly like a great mountain. Formerly there used to be mountains which used to fly and which used to roar. Now we don't have experience but this was an extraordinary bore who is very powerful in the world. The inhabitants of Brahma loka or the next three lokas Janaloka Tapoloka they all became alerted and it was very very loud sound. So that sound which was the all auspicious sound of the All Merciful Lord they chanted auspicious chants from the three Vedas.

### Appearance of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, Early Life, Ray of Vishnu

**Key Quote:** "therefore, from the very beginning of his appearance, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, exhibited all the signs of an exalted eternal associate of the Lord"
**Summary:** This segment describes the auspicious appearance of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, his birth circumstances, and early signs of his divine nature, including the astrologer's predictions and his preference for the Srimad Bhagavatam over coins.

Today is the most auspicious appearance day anniversary of His Divine Grace, Shri La Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur Prabhupāda. Shri La Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur is the spiritual master of the founder āchārya of ISKCON, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. So, a little about his biography on this day of his divine appearance. Shri La Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur was born on February 6th, 1874, corresponding to Māghamāsā Krishna Paksha Panchami. So, according to the Vedic calendar, today is that day, Māghamāsā Krishna Paksha Panchami. He was born at 3:30 in the afternoon. His name before initiation was Bhimala Prasādatta. He was born in Jagannātpuri, in a house in which Shri La Bhaktivedanta Thakur resides. His father was staying very near to the temple of the famous Jagannāt Baldev Subhadrā in Jagannātpuri. He was the fourth son of Shri La Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Shri Yukta Bhagavati Devi. At the time of his birth, all 32 bodily symptoms of a Mahāpūruṣa, a great personality, were pointed out by an experienced astrologer. Furthermore, the boy was born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck like a Brahmin's thread. The astrologer commented at the time of his birth, "I have done many horoscopes in my life, but I have never before seen such a horoscope filled with all the signs of a great personality. This child will become world famous as a brilliant teacher of life's ultimate goal." This was the comment by the astrologer upon preparing the horoscope of the newly born child. When the child was six months old, Lord Jagannāt's Rathiyatra festival was in procession. भगवती देवी, that is the mother of the child, brought the child before the cart, Jagannath Ratha, and offered garland fell from the neck of Lord Jagannath, encircling the boy. This was taken as a sign of special favor by all present, the child is blessed by Lord Jagannath. At the time of the grain ceremony, it was customary to offer the child both coins and books, in order to get some indication of the future tendencies of the child, means one side they will keep some money, and one side they will keep the bhagavatam, the books, so he was offered the child, on one side coins and other side the Srimad Bhagavatam, he accepted the bhagavatam instead of the coins, so this also indicates the future of the child. Therefore, from the very beginning of his appearance, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, exhibited all the signs of an exalted eternal associate of the Lord. He had descended in answer to Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's prayer, for a ray of Vishnu, to help him spread the Krishna consciousness movement. Now Srila Prabhupada explains the meaning of a ray of Vishnu. Prabhupada says, there are two kinds of children born of good fathers, one is educated in Krishna consciousness, so that he can be delivered from the clutches of Maya, in that very life, and the other is a ray of Vishnu, who teaches the world the ultimate goal of life. So Thakur Bhakti Vinod also wanted to beget a child who could preach the philosophy and teachings of Lord Chaitanya to the fullest extent. Bhakti Vinod Thakur himself was a preacher, a great Acharya, but he prayed to the Supreme Lord, "I want to have a child who can preach the teachings of Lord Chaitanya to the fullest extent, preach all over the world." By his prayers, that is by Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's prayers to the Lord, he had as his child, Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, who at the present moment is preaching the philosophy of Lord Chaitanya, throughout the entire world, through his bona fide disciples. This is what Srila Prabhupada explains, what is the meaning of the word, term, ray of Vishnu, that means, Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami, was specially empowered by Lord Chaitanya, simply for the sake of preaching Krishna Consciousness all over the world, that is the exclusive purpose for which he appeared in this world.

### Childhood incidents, Education, Devotional Inclination

**Key Quote:** "just because a small child had done a small mistake, but he took it very very seriously, this is the characteristic of the Acharya"
**Summary:** This segment narrates childhood incidents of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, highlighting his strong devotional inclination, commitment to Krishna consciousness, exceptional memory, and early education in devotional literature and astrology.

When he was a small boy, perhaps two or three years old, his father Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur brought some ripe mangoes from the market, it was the season. Bimal Prasad, that was his name when he was born, Bimal Prasad took one to eat, saying, "This is mine." Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur got up and said in a grave voice, "What is this? New fruit has come into the house, it has not been offered to Lord Krishna, and you have taken it first. Remember, new fruit is to be given first to the Lord, without giving the first share to the Lord, nothing is to be taken." The child was very repentant upon hearing this from his father, and he exclaimed, "What evil thoughts I have had, throughout my whole life, I shall not eat these fruits again, this is the right punishment for one ruled by greed." So this is what the child exclaimed, he made the promise and observed it throughout his whole life. Later on when somebody would offer him nice mangoes, Bhakti Siddhartha Srila Vinod Thakur would say, "I am an offender, I don't deserve to eat these mangoes," in this way he observed that, wow, never again to eat mangoes, just because a small child had done a small mistake, but he took it very very seriously, this is the characteristic of the Acharya. When Bimal Prasad was seven years old, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur was constructing the Bhakti Bhavan in Calcutta at Rambhagan. During that construction, a deity of Lord Kurma was unearthed. Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur ordered his son Bimal Prasad, to begin regulated worship of that deity of Lord Kurma. From the very beginning, the boy used to hear the preaching of his father, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's preaching, with rapt attention. Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur as well as his audience were amazed, to see how a small boy could hear the topics of Krishna consciousness, with such total absorption. By the age of seven, he had committed the entire Bhagavad Gita to memory, and could wonderfully explain the verses as well. See this is a special thing, there may be some children who can commit to memory all the seven hundred verses, but a seven year old small boy, being able to explain all the verses very nicely, that is extremely unusual. Later on, he was trained in publishing and proofreading at Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's printing press, in connection with Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's well known spiritual journal, the Sajjana Toshani. At the age of eleven, Bimal Prasad toured the various places of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's leelas with his father. Bimal Prasad had a photographic memory, whatever he would read once, he could later recall with perfect clarity. He was trained in mathematics and astrology at Sri Rampur school, and he achieved such astounding scholarship, that he was eventually awarded the title Siddhanta Saraswati by his tutors, Pandit Mahesh Chandra Chowramani and Pandit Sundar Lal, just when he was eleven years old, he was awarded this title, Siddhanta Saraswati. During this period, he used to attend the Sunday weekly meetings of Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur's Vishwa Vaishnava Rajya Sabha, and hear his father lecture on the Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu of Srila Rupa Goswami. He was never known to study his school assignments, and while sitting at home, he placed those assignments with studies of devotional literatures, like Srila Narottam Das Thakur's Prarthana and Prema Bhakti Chandrika. However, whenever questions were asked by his teachers, he would immediately answer, and he got excellent results on all of his examinations at school. When the boy was in seventh class, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur, brought Tulsi beads for his son from Jagannath Puri, and gave him the name of Hari, and a Narsimha mantra to chant, which he executed very faithfully, along with the worship of his Kurma Deity, according to the instructions of his father, Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur.

**Key Quote:** "only because of such acharyas, as Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, and later on, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, and Bhakti, his divine grace, are we able to distinguish between the genuine teachings of Lord Chaitanya"
**Summary:** This segment discusses Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's education, his decision to leave Sanskrit College to avoid family life, his condemnation of religious malpractices, and the importance of distinguishing between genuine and deviant teachings of Lord Chaitanya.

At the age of sixteen, while his schooling continued, the books of Srila Bhakti Vinod Thakur formed the serious content of his studies. He also began writing books on astrology. In 1892, at the age of eighteen, Bimal Prasad, who had got the title of Siddhanta Saraswati, took an entrance examination, and entered Calcutta Sanskrit College. As before he paid scant attention to the prescribed books, but he found the time to read all of the philosophical books contained in the library. In 1895, he left the college, as he was very eager to execute his worship of the Lord, and to remain free from the pressure to enter family life. He stated in his autobiography, "If I remain studying with careful attention at the college, Sanskrit College, then extreme pressure will be brought upon me to enter family life, but if I am considered to be foolish and inefficient, then no one will be, no one will put such an inducement upon me, for becoming so engaged, by this consideration, I left the Sanskrit College, and in order to maintain my life for the service of Hari, I was desirous of getting an honest occupation, which I could perform with the intention of earning a humble income." During his student days, he also wrote essays on spiritual topics, for various magazines, and strongly condemned various religious malpractices, which had become prominent in society. At the request of Srila Jagannath Das Babaji, he composed the Navadvipa Panjika, a Krishna iced almanac, in which the months, lunar fortnights, days, lunar days, stars, etc, were all given names of Vishnu. He did not spend very long in his astronomical pursuits, however, and soon dedicated himself fully, to the worship and distribution of the teachings of Lord Chaitanya. Siddhanta Saraswati had been engaged in regularly chanting the Maha Mantra, and a Nusimha Mantra, given to him by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, when he was in the seventh class. He had been worshipping the Kurma Deity since the age of seven. From 1885 onward, he had received special training in printing, editing, etc, at the press, at the Bhakti Bhavan. Thus, the young man was a very qualified candidate, for becoming the disciple of a guru. Many pseudo-gurus of the Sahajiya category wanted to have him, as their disciple, to increase their false prestige, but Siddhanta Saraswati, was not interested in such pretenders. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur explains, during his time, there were so many upper sampradayas, claiming to be representing Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, so Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, rightly pointed out, how people had deviated, many different groups of people, claiming to be followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, but not strictly following the actual regulated principles, compromising on the strict rules and regulations of Sadhana Bhakti, but externally dressing themselves as devotees, and concocting their own methods of worship, deviating from the philosophy, taught by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the philosophy of Bhakti, and misleading the mass of people, so only because of such acharyas, as Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, and later on, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, and Bhakti, his divine grace, are we able to distinguish between the genuine teachings of Lord Chaitanya, strictly according to the authorized scriptures, Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam, Chaitanya Charitamrita, and the deviant teachings.

### Association with Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, Renunciation, Humility

**Key Quote:** "Upon seeing my spiritual master, the extent of my worldly false ego diminished."
**Summary:** This segment describes the arrival of Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj in Navadvipa and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's attraction to him, highlighting the renunciation and humility of Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj and the impact he had on Siddhanta Saraswati.

And false philosophical doctrines of the deviants. In 1898, after Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur had constructed his residence in Navadvipa Dhamma at Godruma Dwipa, and called it Svananda Sukhada Kunjal, and had also discovered Lord Chaitanya's birth site, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj arrived in Navadvipa Dhamma, to see the site of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's birth, and to hear the discourses of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was singing in ecstasy when he arrived in Navadvipa. His only possessions were the Tursi Mala he wore around his neck, and another set he kept in his hand for counting. He was extremely renounced, and genuinely so. He kept a few books such as Narottam Das Thakur's Prarthana and Premabhakti Chambrika. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji had been performing bhajana for many many years in Vrindavan. He was extremely renounced and was the disciple of another great renunciant, Bhagavad Das Babaji, who was the disciple of Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji was not very well educated, and had been a grain merchant in his previous ashrama, but it was widely known that he was a liberated Paramahamsa of the highest caliber in the area of Vraja Mandala. At the time of his arrival, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was wearing a cap made of tiger skin, and was carrying a basket of various items and materials for his devotional service. He spotted Siddhanta Saraswati, and offered him four or five pieces of knotted rope for chanting rounds, a Tilak stamp with the initials for Hare Krishna, a tiger skin cap and paraphernalia for worship. Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj had received the basket and the cap from his spiritual master, Bhagavad Das Babaji Maharaj. Siddhanta Saraswati was very attracted to Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. At the first sight, he was later to comment with humility, saying, "I have been busy within this material world trying to bring sense gratification within the grasp of my hand. I have often thought by obtaining the objects of sense gratification, all my shortcomings will be fulfilled. I often attained different facets that were indeed very rare, but my own personal shortcomings were never mitigated. In this material world, I have had the association of very high-class aristocratic persons. However, seeing their various deficiencies, I could not offer them praise. The most merciful Supreme Lord Sri Gaurasundara, that is Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, seeing me in such a lamentable condition at such a time of adversity, gave permission to two of his dear most devotees, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, to grant their blessings to me. Because I was always intoxicated with a worldly false ego, wanting again and again self-appraisal, I deprived myself of my own real benefit. But because of the influence of my previous birth's activities and devotional service, I came into the association of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who was the form of my spiritual well-wisher. My spiritual master, from whom I took diksha, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, would go and visit Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and many times would reside with him. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, out of his compassion for other living entities, pointed out my spiritual master, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. Upon seeing my spiritual master, the extent of my worldly false ego diminished. I knew that all the other living entities who have taken the human form of life were also fallen and low like myself. But by gradually observing the spiritual character of my spiritual master, I realized that only a Vaishnava could reside in this material world and be of exemplary character."

**Summary:** This segment narrates the story of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's initiation by Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, his engagement in compiling a Vaishnava encyclopedia, and concludes with a prayer for his blessings to advance in Krishna consciousness.

So, Shastras say, a true Vaishnava is decorated with all good qualities. At Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur's urging, Siddhanta Saraswati approached Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji for initiation in the month of Magha of the year 1900. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj expressed reluctance to accept Siddhanta Saraswati as a disciple, knowing him to be a very, very great scholar. Of course, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was not known to be well-educated, but he was a liberated Paramahamsa, a devotee of the topmost caliber through his devotional service. So, when Siddhanta Saraswati pleaded with Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj for initiation, he got the reply that Mahaprabhu will be asked and if Mahaprabhu gives me permission, then only I will initiate you. So, Siddhanta Saraswati approached him again after some days and asked him, what was Mahaprabhu's order? Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj replied, I forgot to ask. The third time Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was requested, he replied, I asked Mahaprabhu, but I did not receive the permission from Mahaprabhu to initiate you. Siddhanta Saraswati then stood up, his heart breaking, and said, If there is no mercy, I will give up my life. After thus indicating his readiness to take his life, Siddhanta Saraswati began to cry. Srilank Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's heart was melted to see this. So, he told Siddhanta Saraswati, go take your bath in the Saraswati river and then come back to me. At that time of initiation, Siddhanta Saraswati received the name Sri Varsha Bhanavi Devi Daita Das. This is another name for Adarani, Varsha Bhanavi Devi. So he is given the name of the servant of one who is very very dear to Radharan and that is Krishna. So he got the name as servant of Krishna. In 1898, Siddhanta Saraswati had accompanied his father to Kashi, Prayag and Gaya and had gathered many facts about all these holy places which were later incorporated into his commentary on the Chaitanya Charitam Rishis. This Chaitanya Charitam Rishis are called Anubhashya. So Srila Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, whose name later was Sri Varsha Bhanavi Devi Daita Das, he was engaged in compilation of a Vaishnava encyclopedia which contained an explanation of Vaishnava terminology, brief biographies of great Vaishnavas, an introduction to the books of the Vaishnava Acharyas, a description of Vaishnava, a description of Vaishnava Tirthas and various conclusions of Vaishnava sects. So this compilation is a very very valuable compilation and the work was begun in Puri and continued as Siddhanta Saraswati made his preaching rounds of Sri Mayapur Dham, Sri Jagannath Puri Dham, Sri Vraja Dham. He also studied the various books of Sri Ramadvacharya and Sri Ramanujacharya and published some of them in Bengali. He published biographies of these and other Vaishnava saints in the Sajjana Toshani magazine of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. So there are a lot more details. I don't have time to narrate the whole biography. In conclusion, today being the most auspicious day of his divine appearance, let us pray to him for his blessings so that we can very rapidly make advancement in Krishna consciousness by his mercy.

**Key Quote:** "The impersonal interpretation of the Lord is not according to the divine and personal The interpretation of the mundane wranglers is completely refuted in this verse because it is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord has His qualities, form, pastimes and everything that a person has."
**Summary:** The speaker reads a purport discussing the Lord's transcendental qualities, his affection for devotees, and refuting impersonal interpretations by emphasizing the Lord's personal qualities, form, and pastimes.

The Lord has unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities, and one of them is, his affection for his unalloyed devotee. In the history of the mundane world we can appreciate this transcendental quality. The Lord incarnates himself for the protection of his devotees and for the annihilation of the faithless. His activities are in relationship with his devotees. Srimad Bhagavatam is full of such activities of the Lord in relationship with his devotees and the non-devotees have no knowledge of such pastimes. The Lord lifted the Govardhan hill when he was only seven years old and protected his pure devotees at Vrindavan from the wrath of Indra who was over flooding the place with rain. Now this lifting of the Govardhan hill by a seven-year-old boy may be unbelievable for the faithless but for the devotees it is absolutely believable. The devotee believes in the almighty potency of the Lord while the faithless says the Lord is Almighty but do not believe it. Such men with a poor fund of knowledge do not know that the Lord is the Lord eternally and that one cannot become the Lord by meditation for millions of years or by mental speculation for billions of years. The impersonal interpretation of the Lord is not according to the divine and personal The interpretation of the mundane wranglers is completely refuted in this verse because it is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord has His qualities, form, pastimes and everything that a person has. All these descriptions of the transcendental nature of the person that you have got it are factual realizations by the devotee of the Lord and by because of this mercy of the Lord they are revealed to his pure devotee and to no one else.

**Key Quote:** "Please understand that nirguna means without any material qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord is telling Brahma that Brahma can get factual realization of the personal feature of the absolute truth, the personality of God, and clarifies that 'nirguna' means without material qualities, contrasting them with personal qualities like feelings and affection.

They have spoken to Brahma and the Lord is telling Brahma that Brahma can get factual realization of the personal feature of the absolute truth, the personality of God. So one of the attributes of the personal feature is the transcendental qualities of the Lord. So one of the attributes of the personal feature is the transcendental qualities of the Lord. The impersonalists, when they hear about the word quality, dhūna, they immediately think or consider God is nirgūna. So nirgūna literally means without any qualities. So nirgūna literally means without any qualities. So nirgūna literally means without any qualities. But, the devotees are not those who don't know about the whole picture of the Divine, Please understand that nirguna means without any material qualities. Our experience in this world is that there are so many different material qualities. Every object, material object has got quality. Every person has quality. Now, the objects have qualities based on the material they are made of. This table, if it is a wooden table, it has got qualities of wood. If there is a metal table, it will have qualities of metal. So that we can understand, these are all material qualities based on the material of which the object is made. But what about a person of this world? What are his qualities like? So we can understand there are qualities of a person which are different than the qualities of different material objects when we consider a person. So person means he has feelings. He has got affection. He has got anger. He has got some compassion. So these are all personal qualities which are not to be found in any material object, in any dead thing, material thing.

**Key Quote:** "So the qualities a person displays or appears to have are not spiritual qualities. They are all material qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how personal qualities in this world are not permanent and are therefore not attributed to the eternal soul, emphasizing that the absolute truth is without material qualities.

So these are qualities or attributes of a person. But our experience in this world also is that the personal qualities are not permanent qualities. A person's qualities keep changing. Just like a child may display some playful behaviour. Or playful qualities. The same child grows up and becomes a mature person. Then the playful qualities are not there. So we see these qualities of a person can change. So even though we understand, person's qualities are different than the qualities of this world. Material objects. Still, because the qualities are changing, we do not attribute those qualities to the soul. To the eternal soul within the body. To the real person. And Bhagavad Gita also describes that every person who takes birth in this world has got what is called as an acquired nature. Itchaa dvesha samutthena dvanga mohena bharata sarva bhuttani sammoham sargeyati paramtaka At the beginning of creation, every person has got a certain acquired quality due to association with the gunas, with material nature. Karanam gunasamkosthir sarasadyogijanvasu Everybody takes birth according to the association with the gunas and accordingly they have different qualities. So the qualities a person displays or appears to have are not spiritual qualities. They are all material qualities. Even though they are not like the qualities of matter, still they are material qualities. Which means to say that if the absolute truth is without material qualities, nirguna,

### anger, material quality, incarnation of Narasimha

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So then how do we understand that the Supreme Lord appears in His form as Narasimha and He displays anger?"
**Summary:** The speaker poses the question of how to reconcile the idea of an absolute truth without material qualities with the Lord's appearance as Narasimha displaying anger, and presents the impersonalists' view that such incarnations are material forms.

then the absolute truth will not have any of the qualities that we have or we display. So if we display anger, then the scriptures also say you should control anger. Anger is not good for you. Anger may lead to so many dangerous things. Just like somebody becomes very angry, then they lose their discrimination, they lose their intelligence. Grodhar bhavati sammoha One becomes bewildered, one's intelligence is lost, one's memory is completely bewildered. So, anger should be controlled. Anger is not a good quality. One should conquer anger. So naturally, the conclusion will be that anger is actually a material quality, which is not a desirable quality. And certainly we don't expect that the absolute truth will have anger. Because absolute truth is nirguna, without any material qualities. So then how do we understand that the Supreme Lord appears in His form as Narasimha and He displays anger? So, the impersonalists will say, Oh, that incarnation of Narasimha is a material incarnation, a material form. Material form, naturally there will be anger. And that anger has to be controlled. And that is why the impersonalists will say, Oh, Bhagavatam is described, the Lord was very angry, Narasimha was very angry. Then Prahlad Maharaj went and pacified the Lord. And then the Lord became free from anger. And then very lovingly He placed His lotus hand on Prahlad and blessed him. Sometimes even God becomes angry when He comes in the material form. And then His anger has to come down. Just like a human being of this world. He becomes angry then he has to pacify himself or somebody has to pacify him. He has to give up this anger.

**Key Quote:** "But the Bhagavatam describes that Absolute Truth is a transcendental person and Absolute Truth has got transcendental qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the impersonalists' argument that the Absolute Truth doesn't have form or qualities, contrasting it with the Bhagavatam's description of the Absolute Truth as a transcendental person with transcendental qualities.

Like that God also. So they say that Absolute Truth actually doesn't have any form. But when the Absolute Truth incarnates then they may, the Absolute Truth may accept some material form. And that material form may display sometimes anger, sometimes display compassion, even compassion. Compassion also, the impersonalists think, if a person has compassion, that compassion sometimes we see is misplaced. Just like a mother is very very compassionate with her child. But we also know when the mother does not strictly correct the child and the child grows up with some pampering by the mother then everybody will say mother has spoiled the child. So she should not have shown compassion for the child when it was not properly placed, improperly placed compassion. Undue compassion. So even this compassion, this materialistic, this impersonalism will say that's also a material quality. That quality also should be absent in the Lord or in the Absolute Truth, it should not be there. This is material quality. So impersonalists will argue that all these qualities we see in a person of this world are all material qualities. So there is no question of Absolute Truth having compassion, Absolute Truth having anger, Absolute Truth having impersonal qualities. So it goes on to prove their point apparently that Absolute Truth is impersonal. It does not have personality. Because person means having some material qualities. But the Bhagavatam describes that Absolute Truth is a transcendental person and Absolute Truth has got transcendental qualities. Now what are these transcendental qualities? What is this transcendental personality? This cannot be understood if we try to understand through our material conception

### material conception, eternal person, supreme Brahman

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You are eternally a person. Purusham shashvatam, purusham means person, shashvatam means eternal person."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material conception of a person with the concept of an eternal person as described in the scriptures, quoting Arjuna's description of Krishna as the supreme Brahman and an eternal person.

of a person. In this world we only have experience of what is a material conception of a person. We know of people who take birth and they may be having a good birth, they may be having a very good education, they may be having so many good qualities. But we also know that ultimately even such persons with good qualities, good birth, good education, good upbringing, they also ultimately die. They also become old. They also lose their all their qualities. The qualities they may display for some time but it is all ultimately lost. So the experience we have of a person in this world however great the person may be, however powerful he may be, however powerful he may be, he may be a great person, he may be a great person, he may be a great person, however nice qualities the person may display, still our experience is a temporary personality. A temporary personality. But the Bhagavatam goes on to describe there is another kind of personality. An eternal person. Purusham shashvatam dhiyam Bhagavad Gita describes in the words of Arjuna, Arjuna describes Krishna param brahma paramdhama pavitram paramam bhavan purusham shashvatam dhiyam eternally the supreme person, the transcendental person, param brahma, the supreme brahma, paramdhama, the supreme resting place for everyone and everything. param brahma paramdhama pavitram paramam supreme pure pavitram paramam bhavan you Krishna, you are the supreme Brahman, you are the supreme above, you are the supreme pure. You are eternally a person. Purusham shashvatam, purusham means person, shashvatam means eternal person. Dhiyam,

**Key Quote:** "So, when we hear about the personality of God from the scriptures, it is clearly stated in the scriptures that we should give up all our material conceptions of form, person, qualities or activities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the origin of devatas and Krishna's transcendental birth, emphasizing the need to abandon material conceptions of form, person, qualities, and activities when understanding the personality of God.

you are a transcendental person. Adidevam, you are the origin of all devatas. Devatas have so many good qualities in this world. Compared to humans, compared to other created beings, devatas have so many good qualities. They have beautiful form. They have long lifespan. They have noble qualities. So, even those devatas, they have an origin. Adidevam, that is Krishna. Adidevam. Ajam, Krishna is unformed. But, Ajam, Ajopisan, Avyayatma, even though Krishna is actually unborn, he appears to take birth. Our Ajopisan, Avyayatma, Bhutana, Vishwopisan, Prakritim, Svamudishthaya, Sambhavami, Krishna appears in this world. Krishna takes birth, appears to take birth. That birth is described as Jarmakarma, Jame, Divyam, that is transcendental appearance, transcendental birth. That birth is part of his pastimes, Nila, transcendental activity, part of his transcendental activity, taking birth. So, there is a different kind of personality, not within our experience normally, but which is described in the scriptures like Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita. And, those type of qualities or appearance or activities or transcendental form or transcendental name, all these are described in the confidential portions of the Vedic literature. So, when we hear about the personality of God from the scriptures, it is clearly stated in the scriptures that we should give up all our material conceptions of form, person, qualities or activities.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's qualities are not a product of any of the gunas. He is gunatika. He is above the material modes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the negation of material qualities in Vedanta philosophy is meant to help us understand transcendental attributes, and that Krishna's qualities are not a product of the material modes.

We have to give up all those conceptions. To help us give up those conceptions, the Vedanta philosophy says the absolute truth is nirguna, nirakara, nirmishesha, nirmikalpa. So, all the negation is negation of material qualities, material form, material personality, material attributes. And, at the same time, there are transcendental attributes, satchidananda-vikraha, janma-karma-chame-diljam, sambhavami-atma-mayaya. All these are transcendental attributes, spiritual qualities, spiritual names, spiritual forms, spiritual qualities. So, these are entirely different from material qualities. Now, in the Bhagavad Gita, we can clearly understand from the Bhagavad Gita that if a person becomes angry, kama-esha, krodha-esha, rajo-guna-samut-bhava, it is a product of rajo-guna. Whereas, please put your mobiles on silent mode, it disturbs the class. Whereas, the material qualities a person displays, like kama, krodha, are a product of rajo-guna. Krishna's qualities are not a product of any of the gunas. He is gunatika. He is above the material modes. So, when the Lord appears, Absolute Truth appears as Narsimha, He displays anger that is not a result of rajo-guna, because He is completely transcendental to the modes. Then, what is that anger? That anger is actually one of the transcendental reciprocation of the Lord with His devotees.

### transcendental reciprocation, affection for devotees, Hiranyakashipu and Pralad

**Key Quote:** "So, when the Lord displays anger, it is transcendental anger. Out of his affection for his devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the story of Hiranyakashipu and Pralad to illustrate how the Lord's anger is a transcendental reciprocation born out of affection for his devotees.

Transcendental reciprocation. Just like Hiranyakashipu, he was giving so much trouble to Pralad, even though Pralad was his own son. And the only fault of this boy was that he was chanting the holy names of the Supreme Lord, Vishnu, Narayana. And Hiranyakashipu, with some misunderstanding, thought that Vishnu or Narayana is his enemy. So, Hiranyakashipu was telling his son, Why are you glorifying or chanting the name of my enemy? So, Pralad tried to explain very gently, very patiently, very nicely, Vishnu is not your enemy. Vishnu is nobody's enemy. Vishnu is nobody's anything. Vishnu is everybody's best friend, topmost well-wisher, Surudam Sarvabhutanam. But Hiranyakashipu would not try to understand, would not agree. He only became more and more angry and more and more inimical, to Pralad. So, out of his anger, inimical attitude, he began to give trouble to Pralad. So much so that the boy was tortured. He was tortured mercilessly. And that made the Lord very angry against Hiranyakashipu. Why did you torture my son, my devotee? Why did you torture your son, my devotee? So, when the Lord displays anger, it is transcendental anger. Out of his affection for his devotees. So, Prabhupada mentions here in this Papad, the Lord has unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities and one of them is his affection for his unallotted devotees. So, Pralad is a pure devotee of the Lord. The Lord has got affection for his devotee, Pralad. And when his devotee is in danger, is in trouble, is being troubled by somebody, the Lord will protect his devotee. And in the course of protecting his devotee, the Lord may actually do anything to the not-devotee. To the perpetrator of the trouble, the Lord may do anything. So, because Hiranyakashipu was giving so much trouble to Pralad, Narasimha became very angry. He became very angry against Hiranyakashipu.

**Key Quote:** "So, this display of anger is called transcendental anger."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain transcendental anger, emphasizing that it is not a result of the material modes but is an expression of the Lord's internal potency for the sake of his devotees and the demigods.

And in that anger, he actually killed Hiranyakashipu and all his supporters also, who came to attack Lord Narasimha. So, this display of anger is called transcendental anger. Why? Why is it called transcendental anger? It appears like, you know, anger which is there in this material world, which is displayed by any ordinary person. No, it is not. Because such anger is not a result of Prajopuna. Why? Because the Lord is unaffected by the Gunas. He is completely transcendently situated above the Gunas. How is that he is above the Gunas? Because he is the controller, the master, the source of all the Gunas. All the Gunas are being controlled by the Lord. And they are employed for a different purpose by the Lord. So, when he displays anger, it is his internal potency, his Atmamayam or Yogamayam. Lord has got different energies. One of his energies called his internal potency is employed by the Lord for the sake of his devotees. So, for the sake of Prahlad, the Lord employed his internal potency and using his internal potency he displayed anger. He displayed affection for Prahlad. He blessed the demigods. The demigods were so much harassed by his indecency. So, the demigods prayed to the Supreme Lord that you have to do something to stop this terrorist activity, the terrorist activities of Hiranyakashipu. He had terrorized the whole universe. So, the demigods prayed to the Lord. So, the Lord in response to the demigods prayers, he came and finished off this terrorist Hiranyakashipu. So, the Lord employs his internal potency for the sake of his activities, for the sake of displaying transcendental qualities, for the sake of protecting his devotees. And that is completely free from

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord's use of internal potency leads to liberation for those killed by him, and clarifies that the Lord's actions are not partial but are for the ultimate welfare of all.

the interactions of the kundas. The internal potency is completely a different potency, a different energy. It is completely spiritual. And the effect of the internal potency is that when the Lord kills anybody because the Lord employs his internal potency, the person who is killed is actually liberated. Generally, any person in this world who dies under the influence of the kundas, such a person has to take birth again in this material world and has to undergo the reactions of his karma, past karma. Whereas, when the Lord kills somebody, such a person killed by the Lord is very fortunate that he becomes purified of all karma, all sinful reactions. He becomes completely purified by the touch of the Lord. And also, the person gets liberation. The person gets liberation. That liberation is not possible if a person dies under the influence of the kundas. So, from that we can understand the Lord's killing is as good as his protection. Both are meant for the ultimate welfare of the particular person being killed or protected. So, when the Lord protects his devotees or the Lord kills the demons, both of them are benefited by the Lord transcendentally. Both of them are getting spiritual benefit from the Lord. It appears like the Lord is partial to the lay devotees. The Lord is partial to the devotees. But actually, the Lord says in the Bhagavad Gita, samoham sarva bhuteshu na me deshu astina priyaha Nobody is the object of envy of the Lord. Nobody is the object of special favor of the Lord. Then, we see that the Lord is sometimes favoring his devotees. Whatever is his favor? How do we understand? That's explained here with Prabhupada. That the Lord lifted a golden hill when he was only seven years old and protected his pure devotees at Vrndavana from the wrath of Indra.

**Key Quote:** "So, Krishna, when he was seven years old in Vrndavana, when the Vrajavasis were getting ready for one Indra Yajna, he stopped them from doing Indra Yajna."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Krishna lifting Govardhan hill to protect the Vrajavasis from Indra's wrath, highlighting the devotees' attachment to Krishna and Indra's realization of Krishna's true nature.

The Vrajavasis once they were preparing for the Indra Yajna because they were wanting to offer their gratitude to Indra who supplies rain. The Vrajavasis, they are agriculturists. They depend on the land and cows. So, they require water. So, that water being supplied by Indra as the controller of rains, annually they would worship Indra by performing one Indra Yajna. So, Krishna, when he was seven years old in Vrndavana, when the Vrajavasis were getting ready for one Indra Yajna, he stopped them from doing Indra Yajna. And he told, instead of worshipping Indra, you worship Govardhana. So, the Vrajavasis, because they are very attached to Krishna, very affectionate to Krishna, they agreed to follow Krishna's direction to not worship Indra, but to worship Govardhana. So, when they worshipped Govardhana, Indra became angry. Why are these Vrajavasis not worshipping me? So, I will teach them a lesson. So, he became angry against the Vrajavasis and he sent forth torrential rains, devastating rains. And when the Vrajavasis were harassed in this way, they approached Krishna and told him to protect them against this torrential rains. So, what did Krishna do? Krishna simply lifted the door of the hill and protected the Vrajavasis. Then, Indra realized his mistake. Indra realized his mistake. And Indra came, he stopped the rainfall and came and apologized to Krishna, offered what he prays to Krishna. He understood who is Krishna, not an ordinary covered void, not simply some powerful yogi. Because Krishna lifted the door and protected the inhabitants of Vrindavanam. So, somebody may think Krishna is some powerful yogi. No. Krishna is not a powerful yogi. Not just another covered void. Not simply some attractive child who is the center of attraction of the Vrajavasis. No. He is actually the Supreme Lord who is the master of all the devas, all the devas. So, Indra understood that Krishna is my master. He is my well-wisher. So, therefore, he came and begged forgiveness and he offered wonderful prayers to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "So, the only way to understand this aspect of the Absolute Truth, the personality aspect, whether it is personal qualities, or personal form, or personal name, or the absolute truth of the personality of Godhead, transcendental personality, we cannot understand without the truth."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the understanding of devotees with that of non-devotees regarding the personality of Godhead, emphasizing that only through devotional service can one truly understand the Absolute Truth as a person.

So, the devatas, because they are devotees, even if sometimes they mistake Krishna to be an ordinary person, by Krishna's grace, their mistaken understanding of Krishna is corrected by Krishna. Their mistaken understanding is corrected by Krishna. And they actually offer wonderful prayers to Krishna. They actually beg forgiveness from Krishna. They actually seek Krishna's protection and blessings. Whereas the demons, because they are non-devotees, therefore they cannot understand the personality of Krishna. They cannot understand the incarnations of the Lord. They cannot understand the personality of Vishnu. They categorize Vishnu as a person of this world. They categorize Vishnu as one of the devatas. They categorize Vishnu to be just another powerful devata. But they cannot understand Vishnu is not just another powerful devata. He is not a person of this world. He is completely a transcendental personality. He is the master of the gunas. He is the master of the devatas. He is the source of everything that they cannot understand. So, non-devotees, whether they be demons, whether they be impersonalists, whether they be yogis, whether they be jnanis, whether they be tapasvis, whether they be pious actors, they can never understand the personality of Godhead. Vishnu or Krishna or Narasimha or Vamana or Narayana, they cannot understand as long as they don't take the devotional service. So, the only way to understand this aspect of the Absolute Truth, the personality aspect, whether it is personal qualities, or personal form, or personal name, or the absolute truth of the personality of Godhead, transcendental personality, we cannot understand without the truth. So, Bhagavad Gita, it is said, bhakti-yamā abhijānāti yamā yaccha-asmi tattva-tahā In truth, if you want to understand what is the nature of the personality of the Absolute Truth, then you have to take the devotional service. bhakti-yamā abhijānāti yamā yaccha-asmi tattva-tahā So, only by bhakti it is possible to understand the Absolute Truth as a person. And that person is the supreme ultimate manifestation of the Absolute Truth. The supreme, the source of even Brahman and Paramatma, the source of the impersonal Brahman, the source of all energies, the source of everything and everyone. So, that source is ultimately the Supreme Person, Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Mind is where your thoughts are. That is where the mind is."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to answer a question about the location of the Supersoul by discussing the nature of location in material space and the location of the mind, explaining that the mind is where your thoughts are.

And that is what the Bhagavad Gita says. So, Brahman is now given the realization of the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Person. That is what Brahman is getting the realization through the mercy of Vishnu. And that is being described here by the Supreme Bhagavad Gita. Can the staff have any questions? Now, when we talk of location, we are talking of material space. Just like I am sitting here or all of us are sitting in this hall. So, we are not in some other place. We may have a residence or we may have a place of residence. So, if you are here, you are not in your home. If you are near home, you are not in the temple. Right? So, we say a person is in a particular place based on where his body is. Correct? After all, the body is matter. Matter or material object can have a material location or place. Even when it comes to subtle matter, this is gross matter. For example, a person is sitting in this hall, but mentally he can be somewhere else. He can be in his home. Right? He is sitting here, but he is thinking of his own. Maybe. He has left his child and come. Oh, child! He is afraid. Where is my father? Where has he gone? Child has been waiting, anxiously waiting for me to go back home. So, I have to return immediately. Right? So, mentally he may be not here. Mentally, he can be somewhere else. So, where is the mind? If I ask you, where is the mind? Is it here? Or is it there? Or is it in America? So, what is the answer? Where is the mind? Mind is where your thoughts are. That is where the mind is. Generally, our thoughts are centered around our body. Therefore, we say the mind is inside here. But actually, the mind cannot be located in physical space because mind is not a physical object.

**Key Quote:** "So, the soul is where the consciousness is."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the location of the soul, stating that the soul is where the consciousness is, and that consciousness can be changed.

This table, does it have a mind? No. So, table is here means it is here. That's all. You cannot say table is here, but it can also be somewhere else. No, not possible. Similarly, your body, gross body, we can only say it is in one place. You cannot say your body is here as well as in your house. No. If your body is here, it is in your house. But your mind is not like that. Your mind is where your thoughts are. If you are thinking of your body, then your mind is in your body. If you are thinking of America, your mind is in America. It's not difficult to understand, isn't it? Likewise, where is the soul? The soul has got an activity of consciousness. Consciousness belongs to the soul. So, if you are bodily conscious, where is the soul? In the body. If you are Krishna conscious, where is the soul? With Krishna. If you are America conscious, where is your soul? In America. So, the soul is where the consciousness is. Now, the consciousness need not be in one place always. The consciousness can be changed. Generally, people are body conscious. Because they think, I am the body. So, where is their soul? In the body. If they are conscious of their wealth, all the time thinking, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, it's bigger than honey. Then, where is their consciousness? In money. So, where are they? Where is the soul? In money. If they are very much attached to some person, then where is their consciousness? In that person. So, they are always with that person. Always with that person. So, the soul is where the consciousness is. If you become Krishna conscious, then you are with Krishna. You are always where your consciousness is. So, if you become Krishna conscious and you become fixed up in Krishna consciousness, then you are always with Krishna. Even though your body may be here, your mind may be somewhere else, it doesn't matter. Your consciousness is Krishna consciousness, you are Krishna. And where is Krishna? Krishna is always in the spiritual world.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that going to the spiritual world involves a change of consciousness to Krishna consciousness, and that the Supersoul is located where Krishna is.

So, you are always in the spiritual world. So, if you want to go to the spiritual world, you have to change your consciousness from material consciousness to Krishna consciousness. So, going to the spiritual world involves a change of consciousness. That's all. That's why Krishna says, Man Mana Think of me. Go and become my devotee. What happens if you think of Krishna? Then you are with Krishna. If you think of Krishna, you are with Krishna. If you become Krishna's devotee, then your consciousness is Krishna consciousness. Your consciousness is changed. You become his devotee. So, now coming to the question, where is the super soul? Super soul is, again, person. Person means consciousness. What is consciousness of the super soul, Paramatma? Krishna consciousness. So, where is the super soul? May be where the Krishna is. In the spiritual world. But we also read in the Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavad Gita, there is a word that says, the Supreme Lord as Ishwara, as the Paramatma, He is in the heart region of every living entity. He is inside every living entity, in the heart region, Brut Deshe. It's a particular location. So, that is the localized aspect of the Supreme Lord Krishna, who has entered into the heart of every living entity in order to animate this body, in order to give intelligence to the soul who is trapped in this body.

### Supersoul, heart region, digestion

**Key Quote:** "Paramatma is present in the heart region and He manifests one fire of digestion called Vaishvanara."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Supersoul is present in the heart region of every living entity, animating the body and providing intelligence, and that the Supersoul manifests the fire of digestion.

To help that soul, the Supreme Lord expands Himself and enters into every body, everybody's heart, and gives the person knowledge, gives him remembrance, enables him to utilize this body for certain purposes. Just like I am using this body for the sake of eating food and digesting the food. So, Paramatma is present in the heart region and He manifests one fire of digestion called Vaishvanara. That also Krishna tells us in Bhagavad Gita. Aham Vaishvanaro Bhutva Praninam Dehama Svitah Pranapana Samayukta Pacham Yantam Chatur Vidah He simply eats some rice, dal, kondal, whatever you like. How is it digested? What are you doing for digestion? You can't do anything. Only when food is not digested, you come to know, Oh, I am indigestion. I have loose motion. I am vomiting. I have stomach pain. Then you run to the doctor. But actually, when digestion happens, everything is fine. Who is digesting the food? How is the food getting digested? You are not doing anything. It is Paramatma who is digesting the food by manifesting one fire of digestion called Vaishvanara. So, Paramatma is here for my sake. For me to digest the food I am eating. For me to lift my hand. Paramatma is seated there. And he has made one elaborate arrangement called nervous system, circulatory system, digestive system, muscular system. See, some signal in the brain. Signal comes here. The nerves give another signal to the muscle to contract. The muscle contracts and then I lift my hand. I foolishly think, I am lifting my hand. Neither this is my hand nor I am able to lift this hand. This is Paramatma who is annotating this body. So, in that sense, we can say Paramatma is here. But since Paramatma is a spiritual personality, he cannot be located in space, material space. So, they search for Paramatma inside, they will never find Paramatma. Because Paramatma is a spiritual personality, not a physical body, not a physical object.

**Key Quote:** "So, when Bhagavad Gita Krishna says, I am seated in everybody's heart as Paramatma, it means that the Lord is actually enabling everything that is happening in this body as Paramatma."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Paramatma is a spiritual personality and cannot be located in material space, but enables everything happening in the body, giving consciousness to what would otherwise be dead matter.

What is there in material space? Physical object. You can locate. Even mind you cannot locate. What does become Paramatma? Can you locate the mind here? Or anywhere in space, can you locate the mind? No. Mind is not a gross physical object. So, it doesn't have a physical location. Similarly, Paramatma doesn't have physical location. So, when Bhagavad Gita Krishna says, I am seated in everybody's heart as Paramatma, it means that the Lord is actually enabling everything that is happening in this body as Paramatma. In His creatures, Paramatma, He is facilitating everything that is happening in this body. He is the one who gives this body what is called as consciousness. Otherwise, the body is dead matter. Body is dead matter. Like this table is dead matter. Similarly, body is also dead matter. It is made up of earth, water, fire and sky. Similarly, table also. But how is this body appearing to have life symptoms? It is only because of the presence of Paramatma who manifests something called Chetana. Consciousness. The consciousness that is flowing in this body is due to the pancha vayu. Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana. In common parlance they say, when a person dies, what they say? Prana hoito. Prana chale gaya. In Tamil also they say Prana. In Tamil you say that? When a person dies? Prana hoito. Prana. Prana hoito. So, what is that Prana? The Paramatma has left and along with him the Prana is gone. The consciousness which animates this body, which makes this body living, show life symptoms. That is gone. So, I am not in this body and because of me, oh, this body is living. No. It is because of Paramatma, the body appears to be living. Of course, I am also there in this body. Trapped in the false consciousness called body consciousness. I think I am this body. I think I am, this body is mine. Aham mama. Two conceptions for the false seeker. Aham kara. What is that? One is that I am this body or this body is mine. Two conceptions. So, both are actually false conceptions of the soul, of the person, of the you, of the real you. So, you are not the body. Neither the body belongs to you. But you think like that out of falsehood. In reality, what is happening? Paramatma is animating this body and make you feel as if you are the body or the body belongs to you. To facilitate your sense gratification, your enjoyment, material enjoyment, Paramatma is making elaborated. But it is a temporary arrangement. Nevertheless, it is not a permanent arrangement. So, actually Paramatma is not here. Paramatma is spiritual. Paramatma is a supreme person. But he expands and actually localizes himself in this heart region for the sake of the body.

**Key Quote:** "God for the atheist is not present in this form. For the Atheist, this form is simply a statue."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the yogis' attempts to find Paramatma with the devotees' understanding of Krishna's presence in statues, and the atheists' view that statues are merely metal.

So, you cannot search out for Paramatma here and find him. The yogis, they try to search out for Paramatma in the heart. They do conceive form of Paramatma in their mind and they meditate. But simply because they meditate, simply because they do Ashtanga Yoga, they cannot see Paramatma. Because there is no Paramatma here. Paramatma is there in the spiritual world. So, they can see the Paramatma only when Paramatma by his blessings, by his grace, he actually gives darshan. Just like we say Krishna and Balarama are here. But, those who are not devotees, they will say, this is simply one statue, we are calling it God. This is not God. See, it's a metal statue. But for a devotee, this is not a metal statue. This is actually Sakshat Krishna and Balarama, the transcendental personalities. So, what is the difference? You say God is here. Atheists would say, God is not here. This is simply one statue. You foolish people, you believe. You have got some sentiment. You have got some philosophy. You have been cheated. You are brainwashed. To think one statue is here, to think that the statue is God, you have been brainwashed. And how will they prove their point? See, when some invaders came and attacked, did your brother go in them? In Vrindavan? What did Krishna do? You say God is there, worshipping. What did God do? God was simply silent. Silently sitting, doing nothing. The fellow came, he broke the temple, he stole away the deities, whatever, the jewellery, you decorate. Oh, God is there, I have to decorate you. Anamkar, Priya Vishnu, your scriptures, you know. And then you do so much decoration. Oh, so nice. Sentimental, foolish people, there is no God. Simply one statue, one doll, you are decorating. Because when somebody comes to take away the real jewellery, golden jewellery, you are putting out a sentiment for God. The gold jewellery nicely attracts thieves, plunderers. They come, they say, oh, foolish people, they think God is, statue is God. And then there is no God. They come, he will steal the golden ornaments and go away and then you people think, oh, what has happened? You police come to it. That's all you people can do. Sentimental, foolish people. This whole atheist will not do that. So, what is other understandable? If God is present in the form of this statue, then what is God doing? So, other understanding is that God is present, yes, only for the devotees. God for the atheist is not present in this form. For the atheist, For the Atheist, this form is simply a statue. For the Atheist, the form is simply a statue.

**Key Quote:** "But for the devotee, there is another spiritual dimension in existence. And in that dimension, that is above the material dimension."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to contrast the atheists' materialistic view with the devotees' understanding of a spiritual dimension, where Krishna is eternally present and can manifest for the sake of his devotees.

Just like for the atheist, there is no person inside this body. This body is simply one mechanical arrangement of blood and flesh and bones and skin and brain and nervous system, circulatory system. There is no person inside this, there is no soul. All foolish people believe, Atheists would say. According to the Atheists, what is this body? It is simply one arrangement. That's all. The arrangement, it will stay for some time. Any arrangement in this material world, you can see in this world, you can see any arrangement, it will stay for some time, that's all. No arrangement is permanent in this world. So this arrangement, it will stay. 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, 80 years, it will stay. And then the arrangement is finished. Over. Everything is finished. You say, person died. Why are you crying, person died? Simply one arrangement was made and the arrangement is finished. So for the Atheist, there is no soul in this body. There is no real person. Simply one mechanical arrangement. Kama. Kima arhya. Kama hai dhukam. Demons. Asuras. They argue. Due to kama, man and woman combine and produce one offspring, a child. What is that child? Simply one lump of flesh, blood, bones, mucus. That's all. That arrangement will remain for some time, yes. With some changes, like changes happen in matter. And these changes will happen. There is no person. So, for the Atheist, there is no soul. There is no God. There is no spirit. But for the devotee, there is another spiritual dimension in existence. And in that dimension, that is above the material dimension. It is beyond the material dimension. So even though Krishna is present here as the Didi, that Krishna is not in the material dimension. He is not located in space and time. He is eternally there as the spiritual transcendental personality. And for the sake of his devotee, even though he doesn't exist in the material dimension, he is in the spiritual dimension.

**Key Quote:** "As long as they don't take to bhakti, for them, there is no personal God, there is no spirit, there is no soul, there is no spiritual dimension."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that atheists will remain unconvinced of the personal aspect of God without taking to bhakti, as they are under the influence of the illusory energy.

He can come in the material dimension for the sake of his devotee and accept the devotee's seva. Bless the devotee. Take the devotee's seva. So when you offer a flower to Krishna Balram here at the beauty park, Krishna Balram accepts it. Not on the material dimension. On the spiritual dimension. When the atheist comes in front of the Didi, then the Didi is simply one statue itself. Like any other statue. Any other statue which may not be God. Like statue of one political personality is put somewhere. Nobody will think that the actual political personality is there. Just try. Aid for remembering, memory. For memory. For the sake of our memory. For the sake of our sentiment. The person is dead and gone. But we have to remember his great deeds or his great contribution he did for the country and for the people. So out of a token of appreciation of the greatness of the person, of the wonderful deeds he performed, he will garland one statue. Everybody knows that statue is not a person. This way, the way of expressing our gratitude, the way of remembering, memory, in memory of this person we are garlanding the statue. That's the way of understanding of the statue. So, atheists think like that, here you are going for Krishna. If at all there is Krishna, then Krishna is not here. If at all there is God, then God is in your imagination. In that imagination you are projecting on one statue. And because you have some sentiment you want to express gratitude to God, that God protected me, that God is protecting me. So you garland the statue. These are all atheistic arguments. And these will be proven to atheists and atheists will prove to others as long as they don't take to bhakti. As long as they don't take to bhakti, for them, there is no personal God, there is no spirit, there is no soul, there is no spiritual dimension. Simply the imagination are the descriptions in the scriptures, some textbooks, some books, some teachings. Like, the atheists would always, the non-devotees would always argue like that. And they will never be convinced that, because they are completely under the grip of this illusory energy. So illusory energy will convince them, yes, there is no God. You are God. Or everything is God. This world is real. It will convince them. That's the action of the illusory energy. So if you want to know God in his personal aspect, you have to come out of this illusion. Come out of the influence of the illusory energy. Okay, let's stop it. Adraji, Bhagavad Gita, and Yajna,

**Key Quote:** "Those who are helpless must be taken care of by their respective guardians. Otherwise, the guardians will be subjected to the punishment of Yamaraj who is appointed by the lord to supervise the activities of sinful living creatures."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the importance of protecting defenseless creatures (brahmanas, cows, women, children, and old men) and the consequences guardians face if they neglect their duties, drawing parallels to vultures dealing with serpents.

Translation: The brahmanas, the cows, and the defenseless creatures are my own body. Those whose faculty of judgment has been impaired by their own sin look upon these as distinct from me. They are just like furious serpents, and they are angrily torn apart by the bills of the vulture-like messengers of Yamaraj, the superintendent of sinful persons. Please repeat this translation. The brahmanas, the cows, and the defenseless creatures are my own body. Those whose faculty of judgment has been impaired by their own sin look upon these as distinct from me. They are just like furious serpents, and they are angrily torn apart by the bills of the vulture-like messengers of Yamaraj, the superintendent of sinful persons. Please repeat this translation. The defenseless creatures, according to Brahma Samhita, are the cows, brahmanas, women, children, and old men. Of these five, the brahmanas and cows are especially mentioned in this verse because the Lord is always anxious about the brahmanas. The Lord's blessings are the benefit of the brahmanas and the cows, and He is prayed to in this way. The Lord especially instructs, therefore, that no one should be envious of these five, especially the cows and brahmanas. In some of the Bhagavatam readings, the word duhitruh is used instead of duhatihi, but in either case, the meaning is the same. Duhatihi means cow. Tuhithruhu can also be used to mean cow because the cow is supposed to be the daughter of the sun god. Just as children are taken care of by the parents, women as a class should be taken care of by the father, husband, or grown-up sons. Those who are helpless must be taken care of by their respective guardians. Otherwise, the guardians will be subjected to the punishment of Yamaraj, who is appointed by the Lord to supervise the activities of sinful living creatures. The assistants or messengers of Yamaraj are likened here to vultures, and those who do not execute their respective duties in protecting their wards are compared to serpents. Vultures deal very seriously with serpents, and similarly, the messengers will deal very seriously with neglectful guardians.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of Brahmanas and cows in Krishna consciousness, highlighting Krishna as their protector and asserting that protecting them leads to the welfare of the entire world.

So, this is a verse spoken by the Supreme Lord Narayana. He is speaking to the Kumaras. He is particularly mentioning, not only in this verse but in the past few verses, the position of the Brahmanas as so very, very, very important. The whole of Krishna Consciousness is dependent on Brahmanical culture, protection of Brahmanical culture. That's why, every day when we offer food to Krishna, we particularly chant this prayer: Namo Brahmanya Devaya. Go Brahman Hitaya Cha. Go Brahman Hitaya Cha. Jagadhitaya Krishnaya Govindaya Namo Namah. So, Krishna is the protector especially of the Brahmanas and cows. He is actually the protector of everyone. Jagadhitaya. Go Brahman Hitaya. Jagadhitaya. Simply by giving protection to cows and brahmanas, the entire world can benefit; welfare activity is possible for the entire world by simply protecting brahmanas and cows.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the king's responsibility to protect five categories of defenseless creatures: cows, brahmanas, women, children, and old men, emphasizing the special mention of brahmanas and cows in prayers.

So the king or the governmental head has to particularly protect the brahmanas and cows. Actually, shastra says five categories of persons are to be particularly protected by the king or the guardians: defenseless creatures, bhutani alabdha sharanani, defenseless creatures. Otherwise, if they are not particularly, if these five are not protected, they can be exploited, they can be harmed very easily. Who are they? The cows, the brahmanas, the women, the children, and old men. They can be harmed very, very, they are defenseless. And among these five categories of defenseless creatures, two are singled out in that special prayer: namo brahmanya devaya go brahmana hitaya jagad hitaya krishnaya govindaya namo namah. But in this verse, the Lord is particularly mentioning, Lord Narayan is mentioning, dvijavaran duhatir bhutani alabdha sharanani, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, dvijavaran, the brahmanas.

**Key Quote:** "Envying brahmanas is very, very, very sinful."
**Summary:** This segment explains that those who are envious of brahmanas, women, children, cows, or old men are considered sinful and will be punished by Yamaraj's messengers.

But if somebody who, out of enviousness, sees them as different from me, envy is such a bad thing that even though somebody may be respectful to Krishna, but out of enviousness towards a brahmana, let me see the brahmana not as belonging to Krishna, they will see the brahmana as different from Krishna. Such people are actually, if they are envious of brahmanas, they are envious of Krishna because brahmanas are not different from Krishna. They are envious of all the other creatures. There are some class of people in the society, they somehow have hatred towards women, and it is a mental disorder actually. They are called misogynist in English, there is a term for this, they hate women, women haters. So according to this verse, such people, by hating women, they are hating the Supreme Lord Narayana, so they are punishable. How are they punishable? They are angrily torn apart by the bills of the vulture-like messengers of Yamaraj, the superintendent of sinful persons. It's sinful to maintain hatred, to be envious of brahmanas or cows or children or women or old men is actually sinful.

**Key Quote:** "The yamadutas punishing is only in hell."
**Summary:** This segment describes the punishments inflicted by Yamadutas in hell, emphasizing that those sent to hell are the most sinful and that even mental sins like envying brahmanas can lead to such severe consequences.

And such sinful persons are punishable by yamadutas, and how are they punished? They are torn apart by the messengers of Yamaraj. This punishment is given in hell. The yamadutas punishing is only in hell. Of course, before the punishment, the yamadutas come to take such sinful people to Yamaraj. That is also punishment only because yamadutas are very, very sinful, very, very fierce to look at. The description is there in sixth canto of Bhagavatam, but the punishment is in hell. They just take, arrest, and take them in their custody to Yamaraj. After Yamaraj's judgment, then only the punishment comes, particularly those who are to be punished by being sent to hell. Hell means special punishment. So what is mentioned here, torn apart by the bills of the vulture-like messengers, Yamaraj is a punishment in hell. So you can imagine how grievous it is. Those who are sent to hell for punishment by yamadutas are the most sinful people in the entire universe, most sinful people.

**Summary:** This segment explains that those destined to be degraded to lower life forms are first punished in hell to adjust their mentality, and that this punishment is inflicted on a special 'yatana sharira' or punishment body.

But if they are to be degraded and taken birth as a hog, then first they have to be punished in hell to accustom them to eating stool and living like a hog because the mentality has to change, the mind has to get adjusted to enter hog's body. So they are punished in hell, and that punishment is not in the subtle body. The subtle body is covered by one yatana sharira, one special body, and that body is meant for just inflicting punishment, that's all. Yatana means suffering due to punishment. Yatana means suffering due to punishment.

That's why in spiritual life it is said, brahmana's quality, what is brahmana's quality in Bhagavad Gita? First quality that is mentioned, shama shamaha dhamaha, shamo dhamo tapasya ucam. Shama is particularly control of the mind. Open, open 18.42, 18.42 word for meaning, shamaha, ah shamaha, what is the meaning? Shravana mangala, peacefulness, peacefulness in the word, in the translation, same thing. It specifically refers to control of the mind. Some other translations or explanation Prabhupada gives control of the mind. So mind control is essential in devotional service or in yoga practice itself. The sixth chapter particularly refers to control of the mind. So mind control is essential in yoga practice itself. So mind control is essential so that we don't have any kind of enviousness. A devotee is non-envious, pure devotee is completely non-envious, he is not envious of any creature, but a brahmana at least should not be envious, not a brahmana, brahmana, any pious person who doesn't want to suffer in hell should not be envious of brahmanas, at least should not be envious of brahmanas, it's very dangerous.

**Key Quote:** "No one should be envious of these five, especially the cows and brahmanas."
**Summary:** This segment explains that giving up enviousness and repenting for past envy can free one from punishment, emphasizing the responsibility of guardians to protect cows, brahmanas, women, children, and old men, and the king's potential sinful reaction for failing to do so.

Now again, somebody has got envy towards brahmanas, if they give up that enviousness, then they are not liable to be punished. They are repentant, they are repentant, they understand the mistake, and they are repentant, then they are freed from the reaction of being, having been envious of brahmanas. Some misunderstanding, somebody may develop some kind of envious feeling towards a brahmana, but afterwards if they realize their mistake and they are repentant, they are freed from that sin. But somebody maintains enviousness towards brahmanas, then this punishment is definitely there in hell for such people. Therefore, Prabhupada says in this purport that no one should be envious of these five, especially the cows and brahmanas, and it is the responsibility of the guardians to give protection to these five categories of creatures, created beings: cows, brahmanas, women, children, and old men. The king has to give protection to the citizens, but particularly these five categories of citizens, these five categories particularly the king has to protect. If he does not give protection, and if they are suffering at the hands of some exploiters, the king gets a portion of the sinful reaction for not having protected them, and what a great responsibility the king has got. It is a very big responsibility for the king.

**Summary:** This segment highlights the responsibilities of husbands and fathers in protecting women, warning of punishment for those who are envious of their wives, and reiterating that defenseless creatures are considered the Lord's own body.

Similarly, being a husband or a father, you see, it is a big responsibility protecting the woman or protecting the mother or protecting the wife or daughter, it is a very big responsibility. If a husband is envious of his wife and maintains that enviousness, this is a punishment because they are also mentioned here, alabdha sharanani bhutani, defenceless creatures. Lord Narayan says they are like me, my body, they are my body. Those who are envious, they are angrily torn apart by the bills of vulture-like messengers of Yamaraj, and these are all not just some poetic descriptions, this is cent percent fact what is said here, so maintaining enviousness is very serious.

**Key Quote:** "All the sinful activities that we may perform in the mind can be rectified by realizing the mistake and being repentant."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how to rectify sinful activities committed through the mind, words, and body, emphasizing the importance of repentance and forgiveness, and noting that the severity of the remedy should correspond to the degree of the sin.

Maintaining enviousness, all the offenses that we commit in the mind, not offenses, sinful activities that we may perform in the mind can be rectified by realizing the mistake and being repentant, being repentant at the mind level. Mentally we can ask forgiveness, but at the level of words, if somebody offends, then they have to ask for pardon using the tongue actually, go and ask pardon or actually beg forgiveness, not mentally, verbal mentally. And if physically somebody has been, we committed a sin, then physically we have to beg forgiveness by bowing down using our body, you see. So mentally if somebody commits sins, then then realizing within one's own mind and being repentant is enough because the degree of sin in the mind is not as severe as the degree of sin committed by words, and the degree of sin committed through physical violence or physical abuse or physical action is not as, sorry, the physical one is very more serious than even verbal sin. So degrees of sin are there, accordingly the the remedy for becoming free from such sins is also correspondingly.

**Key Quote:** "Vaishnava prad you have to bow down you have to actually ask for forgiveness and in the mind also you should be very repentant."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the process of seeking forgiveness for material sins with that of offenses against Vaishnavas, emphasizing that even mental offenses against Vaishnavas require physical acts of humility and seeking forgiveness directly from the offended Vaishnava.

Mentally, verbally, or physically we have to beg forgiveness, but in the case of offenses against Vaishnavas, offense against Vaishnavas, even if mentally we have offended a Vaishnava, we cannot mentally beg forgiveness and expect that we will be absolved of the offense. No, it doesn't work like that. What did Lord Narayana say, Lord Vishnu say to advise to Durvasambali when he offended, when Durvasambali offended Amrish Maharaj, said go to Amrish Maharaj and fall at his feet. So it is Vaishnava prad, you have to bow down, you have to actually ask for forgiveness, and in the mind also you should be very repentant, and we should mindfully ask forgiveness, all the three levels we have to. That's why when we pay obeisances to Vaishnavas every morning, Vaan Chha Kalpat Rubh Yasha, we have to physically bow down, we have to also vibrate that prayer using our tongue, not mentally chant, we have to verbally chant, and we also have to, our mind should be there in the act of offering obeisances and chanting the prayer. So Vaishnava prad is very serious, whereas at the level of on the material platform, sinful activities, there is consideration of levels of sin, mind, words, or body, ok.

**Key Quote:** "If the person is not punished, definitely he is going to be punished by Yamaraj."
**Summary:** This segment addresses the difference between punishment given by state laws and Yamaraj, explaining that if state punishment is commensurate with the sin, there is no further punishment by Yamaraj, using the example of capital punishment for murder.

Punishment given by state laws is different from punishment given by Yamaraj. Yes, it is different, but if the if the punishment is commensurate with the particular mistake or the sin that has been done, then there is no punishment by Yamaraj. Just like somebody has committed a murder, I will give an example, it is a very gross example, but that is the example very easily understandable. Somebody has committed a murder, so if the person is not punished, definitely he is going to be punished by Yamaraj. If the person is punished by the state, the only punishment which can absolve the person is capital punishment, that means he also has to be killed as a punishment, he has to be killed. Now supposing the state law pardons him, nowadays they are after capital punishment to be abolished, it is very, very inhuman, it is considered inhuman. So if they don't give capital punishment for a murderer, then he is going to be punished by Yamaraj, he is going to be punished by Yamaraj like that.

**Key Quote:** "Manusamhita is perfect law book for mankind."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the ideal of state laws following shastras, particularly Manusamhita, contrasting it with the imperfections of state laws enacted by imperfect persons, and highlighting the differing views on animal killing, especially cow killing.

As per shastras, the punishment level is different, and as per state laws, the punishment is different. See, when they don't follow Manusamhita, state laws are not to be specially enacted by the state shastras, they just have to follow shastra, what the shastra says. Manusamhita is perfect law book for mankind, for human beings. So formally kings used to follow Manusamhita, that's all. What are the laws of the state? Manusamhita. Everybody is guided, everybody is following Manusamhita, that's all. Even Yamaraj follows Manusamhita only when it comes to punishing human beings. Yamaraj also follows Manusamhita only, nothing else. See, it is because the state laws are being enacted by imperfect persons, there could be some wrong punishment or less punishment or no punishment, whatever, there is a possibility, there is a possibility, there is a possibility, there is a possibility, there is a possibility. But just like in state law to kill an animal is not considered a state offence, correct? To kill an animal is not considered a state offence, but Manusamhita, laws of God, is an offence, it is an offence, and killing a cow is the worst offence, most grievous offence.

**Summary:** This segment answers a question about why women, children, and old men should be protected, elaborating on the reasons for protecting each group, such as women for generating Krishna conscious progeny.

But people are saying you should kill a cow, some people are saying increasing the number of cows and even killing one cow, if you are killing a cow you can only kill one, if you are killing a cow you can only kill one, but you are killing a cow that is the most a first you can only kill one. Whatever they do, there is no karma. Ok. Yes Madhav. My next question. See that's why human form of life is junction point. From human life one can go down or one can remain on the human level or one can be elevated to the higher level. But lower creatures simply keep getting higher births till they come to the human form. Yeah. Next question. Maharaj, in purport it is explained these five kind of people to be protected like brahmana, cows, women, children and old person. So like brahmanas they are protected because they are carrying or giving this brahmanical culture to the society. So they should be protected. Then cows like they are maintaining. So like old person or children could you please elaborate. Why they can be protected other three.

**Key Quote:** "Witnessing the sin is not sinful."
**Summary:** This segment addresses the question of witnessing sin, explaining that witnessing alone is not sinful, but being a mute spectator and failing to fulfill one's duty or responsibility is, using the example of a father witnessing the ill-treatment of his wife.

Any other question? Like if someone witnesses some sin, what is, how it, will it affect the person who witnesses someone, someone's sin? Witnessing the sin is not sinful, but if somebody is a mute spectator, just like I am seeing something is happening and I am not doing something which I am supposed to do. Just like to give a simple example, a father is seeing the son is ill-treated. Why? Ill-treating the mother. Now the father as a husband has got responsibility for his wife. So he can't be just standing and or watching telling, I am not harming her, no. So then he has to act. Okay. So everybody has to perform their particular duty or responsibility irrespective of whether they are involved in a particular activity or not. Just like the king, he may say, I am not killing cow, somebody else is killing cow. No. No. No. No. No. No. So he stands there and he is trying to act. And he tries to prevent that cow killing. Because he is responsible. If he takes no action for preventing cow killing, then the reaction of the cow killing, the king will also get. Prabhupad mentioned this in 1st Cantau.

**Key Quote:** "Animal killing it is considered murder according to the laws of God."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the responsibility for animal killing, stating that it is considered murder according to God's law, and that all involved, from the rearer to the eater, are part of a gang of conspirators and will be punished.

In 1st Parpot. 3. Animal killing. 4. 5. It is considered murder according to the laws of God. So, who are all responsible for the murder? Not just the person who killed, physically actually did the killing. It is the person who reared the animal, person who transported that animal. You see? The person who was responsible for selling the meat, person who is cooking the meat and person who is eating the meat. All of them are actually like a gang of conspirators to kill a person. This is state law also. If there is a gang involved in a murder, all the members of the gang are held responsible for the murder. They are all punished by state law. This is state law actually. Similarly, there is a gang of criminals according to God's law in animal killing. One animal is killed. A gang of conspirators are punished. See, how dangerous it is in modern-day society. Somebody is working in a supermarket as a cashier. So, the person who is working in a supermarket as a cashier may be a vegetarian. But if he is in the cashier counter, he is handling that meat packet and just swiping that through that barcode reader to register that purchase for the person who is purchasing. So, he is selling meat. And if it is, Krishna forbid, cow meat, he is held responsible for the cow killing. And cow killing, he is held responsible for the cow killing. And cow killing, he is held responsible for the cow killing. And cow killers are punished in hell are punished in hell as many times as there are hair on the body of the cow. Can you imagine how much punishment is awaiting this fellow? This is the most dangerous situation in our modern-day society.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the dangers of modern society, where many people are unknowingly involved in cow killing, using the example of a supermarket cashier handling meat, and the severe punishment awaiting cow killers.

Modern day society. See formerly there used to be a butcher and he would only sell meat that's all. There was no meat shop as such separate from the killing of the animal. No separate meat shop concept didn't exist. They'll only kill and they'll only sell. But now so many people not even aware of this killing they are all involved in selling. So it's a very very dangerous society. Risky, very risky. Last question. Hare Krishna Maharaj. Maharaj, if someone borrows money from us and we are not sure what he is doing like he is purchasing something meat or some for some intoxication. So that also we are responsible or we are held for it?

**Summary:** This segment answers a question about the responsibility for borrowed money used for sinful activities, explaining that if the money is not returned, the lender becomes responsible, but that taking to Krishna consciousness can completely free one from sinful reactions, especially cow killing.

If he does not return the money, then you become responsible. Before he dies or before you die, if he does not return the money then you are responsible. If he returns the money then you are not responsible. I am telling this because many times people don't return money. Not one time. No. Not one time. Not one time. Yeah. One time you give generally they will return in a responsible way habitual borrowers they don't return it's very risky what they use the money for because your money which is spent if they don't return so in the laws of god it is like you have spent for whatever that's why the punishment will come not full punishment portion of the punishment but then somebody is taken to krishna consciousness even cow killers they take to krishna consciousness they come completely freed completely freed in fact other than taking to krishna consciousness there is no other way of becoming free from the sinful reactions for cow killing there's no other way that's why chaitanya maha prabhu is so particular please preach this chanting of haray krishna in the worst sinners can be completely freed from all sinful reactions simply by chanting haray krishna

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of preaching Krishna consciousness to save people from suffering in hell, particularly those who break the four regulative principles, and highlighting the transformative power of chanting Hare Krishna.

That's a gift of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to this world. Many times it happens they are ignorant of how grievous a sin it is to be involved in cow killing. They are very, very ignorant, you see. Like all those who took to Krishna consciousness after Prabhupada preached in the western countries, they are very, very ignorant, they are very, very ignorant, they are very, very ignorant, they are very, very ignorant, they are very, very ignorant. They were eating cow flesh, they were eating cow flesh, but they stopped, completely stopped. They realized how dangerous and how grievous sin it is, and now they're chanting haray krishna, they're completely freed, they're completely freed from all sinful reactions of cow killing. So that's why we should preach to people, somehow make them chant haray krishna, otherwise their destination is to suffer in the worst kind of hell. You read in 26th chapter of fifth canto what are the punishment for those who get habituated to intoxication, meat eating, illicit sex. You read actually the suffering is horrible, horrible, very, very, very horrible. So to save people from this and you know four regularity principles are broken by people outside so very common isn't it very common nowadays especially so they're all candidates for hell, they're all candidates for hell, but they can all be saved, they can all be saved, that's why we have to actively vigorously preach to save people from suffering.

The conclusion is that no one can be the benefactor of the Lord; everyone is actually the servant of the servant of the Lord. Rajottam Das ends the Bhaktivedanta purport.

So here it is being described by Kumaras that the Goddess of Fortune, Lakshmi, what is her position actually? She is, the dust of her feet is worn on the head by others. Who are the others? Prabhupada says in the purport: those who are seeking the Goddess of Fortune are the Devatas, the Brahmanas, the Vaishnavas, and everyone else, they are seeking blessings, the favor, the mercy of the Goddess of Fortune. That Goddess of Fortune, she waits upon the Supreme Lord Narayana, Lakshmi Narayana, correct? So Lakshmi waits upon Narayana, for she is anxious to secure a place in the abode of the King of Bees, which is the abode of the King of Bees: Madhu, Vrata, Pater, Dhamma, Dhamnaha. The King of Bees actually is hovering over the fresh Tulasī leaves, which are all over the place, always permanently situated at the lotus feet of the Lord. So the lotus feet of the Lord is the most desired place in the entire Vaikuntha.

Now, many times devotees think Pada Sevanam means we should actually approach the lotus feet of the Lord and actually render service, but in the purport to one particular verse, which is that verse? The verse which describes the nine types of devotional service is spoken by Prahlad Maharaj. Once Hiranyakashipu called his son, after he had finished some Gurukul education, said, "What is the best of what you have learnt in the Gurukul?" So he was expecting the son will tell something about economic development, sense gratification, administration, politics, diplomacy. That's what he wanted his son to learn, and that's what the teachers also were willing to teach in the Gurukul, Shanda and Amarka, two sons of Shukracharya. Instead, Prahlad was not interested in learning all that. He had already learnt whatever he had to learn when he was in the mother's womb. He had learnt from Narada about Bhakti, and that is the highest education, highest knowledge, king of all knowledge. That's what Krishna says in the ninth chapter, Raja Vidya. What is that Raja Vidya? Bhakti is the highest knowledge of all knowledge, Bhakti, pure devotional service. So that he had already learnt.

What is the characteristic of intense attachment? Attachment we all know, because we already have some attachments, material attachments. What is the characteristic of intense attachment? Absorbed in thinking is intense attachment for thinking. Yes, that's correct. But what is the symptom of, let us say, somebody is intensely attached to chanting? What is the symptom of such a person? What can we say? Eagerness to chant more. But how do we know that he has got eagerness to chant more? Huh? Always chanting. Constantly chanting. What is the astakur? What is he doing? Always chanting. Three lakh names a day. Almost 24 hours. Almost 24 hours chanting Hare Krishna. So that is intense attachment for devotional service. So Prabhupada in many places he says a pure devotee is 24 hours daily engaged in serving the Lord. That is because of intense attachment to serving the Lord. So one way of Pada Sevanam that's distinctly described here in the purport is being intensely attached to thinking of the Lord's Lotus Feet. Intensely attached to thinking means always want to think of the Lord's Lotus Feet.

Now Vrindavan is not just the physical place Vrindavan, that is Vrindavan of course, but any place where the glories of the Lord are sung by devotees who are dedicated for such glorification. It's like all temples of the Krishna Consciousness Movement. This is Vrindavan. Wherever pure devotees are chanting or singing the glories of the Lord, that is also Vrindavan. So all such places one wants to reside, any of such places one wants to reside and render service, the same service, constantly engaged in chanting and hearing. Then that leads to, chanting and hearing leads to constant chanting and hearing, by following the rules. Constant chanting and hearing leads to residing in a holy place in Mathura or in Vrindavan, in order to do such service. That means one wants to do this service, devotional service, in the association of devotees.

Just like many times, those who are staying outside and practicing devotional service seriously, they feel that they should also stay in such a temple and do seva, because they can make out the difference, right? For at least some of us, it would have been the impetus to join, so that we can nicely stay amidst devotees and do seva. We might have been doing seva outside, but one of the impetus for joining is, we can stay amidst devotees and completely engage in devotional service. So similarly, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur explains, that a progressive devotee goes through these stages. I will read that portion in Nectar of Instruction, because sometimes devotees think that Prabhupada has not given details beyond sadhana bhakti, how to execute sadhana bhakti practically. Practical tips, practical description Prabhupada has not given. Actually he has given that.

Chanting and remembering. Rasana manasi niyodhya. Tongue. You have to vibrate the tongue. Not chanting in the mind. Chanting by vibrating the tongue. And of course, one has to engage the mind in remembering. So for remembering in the mind, one has to not only chant, one should also hear. Chanting and hearing constitutes remembrance. Attentively. Chanting and hearing attentively constitutes remembrance. So here, one should practice without material motives chanting and remembering Krishna and his name, form, quality, pastimes. In this way, after developing a taste for such things, for chanting and remembering constantly, one should try to live in Vrindavan and pass his time constantly remembering Lord Krishna's name, fame, pastimes, and qualities under the direction and protection of an expert devotee.

Absorption, meditation, when you become absorbed in chanting and hearing always without interruption, then naturally your mind gets fixed on chanting and hearing.

So, which is what brings me to this question? How to do this remembrance? If you speculate how to do remembrance, then you will try to imagine some or picturize something in the mind. That is not what is told, is the method. So, one should actually meditate on the lotus feet. So, that is meditation stage, sub-stage of smarana. Recollection, absorption, meditation. Then, the fourth one is constant remembrance. By meditation, 24 hours a day, one has no other business or engagement for the mind than meditation. 24 hours a day, constant remembrance. And that leads to trance, samadhi, total absorption in meditation. The mind is completely soaked up only in one activity. Only in one activity. No other activity.

They were so attached to Krishna that their other bodily activities were done automatically without their specific attention on those activities. Oh, it is time to eat something? Okay, we will eat. But eating also, you see, constant remembrance leading to trance. That's why all these yadus, Brajavasis, they are always in Samadhi.

I heard one devotee in Vrindavan say that he wants to chant Vrindavan in Vrindavan. So, this of course eagerness may not be a wrong thing, but why before one becomes qualified should one even attempt Vrindavan? Where is Prabhupada giving us all these directions? How will we know our constitutional position? Prabhupada is clearly given here. Has he not given clearly? They won't read all these things and then say Prabhupada has not given us, not taught us. So, carefully studying Srila Prabhupada's books is so important. Only then we will realize Prabhupada has given us A to Z everything to achieve our goal.

### personal feature of God, impersonalism, qualities of the Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is the realization of the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, the Personal Attribute of God."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of the personal feature of God and contrasts it with the impersonal view, focusing on the qualities of the Lord.

So these are words spoken by Vishnu, Prabodha Kishayi Vishnu. They have spoken to Brahma and the Lord is telling Brahma that Brahma can get fractured. This is the realization of the personal feature of the Absolute Truth, the Personal Attribute of God. So one of the attributes of the personal feature is the transcendental qualities of the Lord. The impersonalists, when they hear about the word quality, guna, they immediately think or consider God is nirguna.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So these are all personal qualities, which are not to be found in any material object, in any dead thing, material thing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'nirguna' as being without material qualities and differentiates between material and personal qualities.

So nirguna literally means without any qualities. But the devotees understand that nirguna means without any material qualities. Our experience in this world is that there are so many different material qualities. Every object, material object has got quality. Every person has quality. Now the objects have qualities based on the material they are made of. This table, if it is a wooden table, it has got qualities of wood. If there is a metal table, it will have qualities of metal. So that we can understand, these are all material qualities based on the material of which the object is made. Now what about a person of this world? What are his qualities like? So we can understand there are qualities of a person, which are different than the qualities of different material objects, when we consider a person. So person means he has feelings. He has got affection. He has got anger. He has got some compassion. So these are all personal qualities, which are not to be found in any material object, in any dead thing, material thing. So these are qualities or attributes of a person.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, the qualities a person displays, or appears to have, are not spiritual qualities. They are all material qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how personal qualities are impermanent and influenced by material nature, emphasizing that they are not spiritual qualities of the soul.

But our experience in this world also is that, the personal qualities are not permanent qualities. A person's qualities keep changing. Just like a child may display some playful behaviour, or playful qualities. The same child grows up, and becomes a mature person. Then the playful qualities are not there. So we see these qualities of a person can change. So even though we understand, person's qualities are different than the qualities of this material objects. Still, because the qualities are changing, we do not attribute those qualities to the soul, to the eternal soul within the body, to the real person. And Bhagavad Gita also describes, every person who takes birth in this world, has got what is called as an acquired nature. At the beginning of creation, every person has got, a certain acquired quality, due to association, with the gunas, with material nature. Everybody takes birth, according to the association with the gunas, and accordingly they have different qualities. So, the qualities a person displays, or appears to have, are not spiritual qualities. They are all material qualities. Even though they are not like the qualities of matter, still, they are material qualities. Which means to say, that if the absolute truth is without material qualities, nirguna, then the absolute truth will not have any of the qualities that we have,

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So then, how do we understand, that the Supreme Lord, appears in His form as Narasimha, and He displays anger?"
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the apparent contradiction of the absolute truth being without material qualities while the Lord displays anger as Narasimha, presenting the impersonalist viewpoint.

or we display. So if we display anger, then the scriptures also say, you should control anger. Anger is not good for you. Anger may lead to so many, dangerous things. Just like, somebody becomes very angry, then, they lose their discrimination. They lose their intelligence. One becomes bewildered, and one's intelligence is lost, and memory is completely bewildered. So, anger should be controlled. Anger is not a good quality. One should conquer anger. So naturally, the conclusion will be, this anger is actually, a material quality, which is not a desirable quality. And certainly we don't expect, that the absolute truth will have anger. Because the absolute truth is nirguna, without any material qualities. So then, how do we understand, that the Supreme Lord, appears in His form as Narasimha, and He displays anger? So, the impersonalists will say, oh, that, incarnation of Narasimha, is a material incarnation. A material form. Material form, naturally, there will be, anger. And that anger has to be controlled. And that is why, the impersonalists will say, oh, Bhagavatam is described, the Lord was very angry, Narasimha was very angry, then Prahlad Maharaj went and pacified the Lord, and then the Lord became, free from anger, and then very lovingly, He placed His lotus hand on Prahlad, and blessed him. Sometimes, even God becomes angry, when He comes in the, material form. And then, His anger has to, come down, just like, a human being of this world, he becomes angry, then he has to pacify himself, or somebody has to pacify him, he has to give up his anger. Like that,

**Key Quote:** "But, the Bhagavatam describes, that absolute truth, is a transcendental person, and absolute truth has got, transcendental qualities."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to contrast the impersonalist view with the Bhagavatam's description of the absolute truth as a transcendental person with transcendental qualities.

God also. So, they say, that absolute truth, actually doesn't have any form. But when the absolute truth, incarnates, then, they may, the absolute truth may accept some, material form. And that material form, may display sometimes anger, sometimes display compassion, even compassion. Compassion also, the impersonalists think, if a person has compassion, that compassion sometimes we see, is misplaced. Just like a mother is very, very compassionate with her child. But we also know, when the mother, does not, strictly, correct the child, and the child grows up, with some, pampering by the mother, then everybody will say, mother has spoiled the child. So, she, should not have shown compassion, to the child, when it was, not, properly, placed, improperly, placed compassion, unto compassion. So, even this compassion, this materialistic, this impersonalist will say, that's also a material quality. That quality also, should be absent in the law, or in the absolute truth, it should not be there. This is material quality. So, impersonalists will argue, that all these qualities, we see in a person, of this world, are all material qualities. So, there is no question of, absolute truth having compassion, absolute truth having, anger, absolute truth having any personal qualities. So, it goes on to, prove their point, apparently, that absolute truth is impersonal, does not have personality. Because, person means, having some material qualities. But, the Bhagavatam describes, that absolute truth, is a transcendental person, and absolute truth has got, transcendental qualities.

**Key Quote:** "Bhagavad Gita describes, ah, in the verse of Arjuna, Arjuna describes Krishna, ah, param brahma paramdhama avitram paramam bhavan purusham shashwatam divyam."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that transcendental qualities cannot be understood through material conceptions and quotes Arjuna's description of Krishna as the eternal, transcendental person.

Now, what are these transcendental qualities? What is this transcendental personality? This cannot be understood, if we try to, understand, through, our, material conception, of a person. In this world, we only have experience of, what is, a material conception of a person. We know, of people who take birth, and, they may be, having a good birth, they will be having a very, good education, they may be having so many, good qualities. But, we also know, that ultimately, even such persons, with good qualities, good birth, good education, good upbringing, they also, ultimately, die. They also, become old. They also, lose their, all their qualities. The qualities, they may display for some time, but, it's all, ultimately lost. So, the experience we have, of a person, in this world, however great the person may be, however, ah, however, nice qualities, the person may display, still, our experience is, a temporary personality. A temporary personality. But, the Bhagavatam goes on to describe, there is another kind of personality. An eternal person. Purusham Shashwatam Divyam. Bhagavad Gita describes, ah, in the verse of Arjuna, Arjuna describes Krishna, ah, param brahma paramdhama pavitram paramam bhavan purusham shashwatam divyam. Eternally, the supreme person, the transcendental person. Param Brahma, the supreme Brahman. Paramdhama, the supreme resting place, for everyone and everything. Right? Param Brahma, Paramdhama, Pavitram Paramam, supreme pure. Pavitram Paramam Bhavan, you, Krishna, you are the supreme Brahman, you are the supreme abode, you are the supreme pure. You are eternally a person. Purusham Shashwatam, Purusham means person, Shashwatam means eternal person. Divyam,

**Summary:** The speaker describes Krishna as the origin of all devatas and explains that Krishna's birth is a transcendental activity described in scriptures.

you are a transcendental person. Adidevam, you are the origin of all devatas. Now, devatas have so many good qualities in this world. Compared to humans, compared to other created beings, devatas have so many good qualities. They have beautiful form, they have long lifespan, ah, they have noble qualities. So, even those devatas, they have an origin, Adidevam, that is Krishna. Adidevam, ajam, Krishna is unborn. But, ajopisan avyayatma, even though Krishna is actually unborn, he appears to take birth. Ajopisan avyayatma, bhutana vi shuro pisan, prakatim svam nishthaya, sambhavami, Krishna appears in this world. Krishna takes birth, appears to take birth. That birth is described as janma karma jame divyam, that is, transcendental appears, transcendental birth. That birth is part of his past times, nila, transcendental activity, part of his transcendental activity, taking birth. So, there is a different kind of personality, not within our experience normally, but which is described in the scriptures like Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita. And, those type of qualities or appearance or activities or transcendental form or transcendental name, all these are described in the confidential portions of the Vedic literature.

So, when we hear about the personality of God in front of the scriptures, it is clearly stated in the scriptures that we should give up all our material conceptions of form, person, qualities, or activities. We have to give up all those conceptions. To help us give up those conceptions, the Vedanta philosophy says the absolute truth is nirguna, nirakara, nirmishesha, nirmikalpa. So, all the negation is negation of material qualities, material form, material personality, material attributes. And, at the same time, there are transcendental attributes, sacchidananda, vikraha. janma karma chame dhinyam sambhavami atma vayaya All these are transcendental attributes, spiritual qualities, spiritual names, spiritual forms, spiritual qualities. So, these are entirely different from material qualities.

**Key Quote:** "So when Lord appears as, Absolute Truth appears as Narasimha, he displays anger that is not a result of rajoguna, because he is completely transcendental to the modes."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's qualities are not products of material modes and that the anger displayed by Narasimha is a transcendental reciprocation with devotees, setting up the story of Prahlad and Hiranyakashipu.

Now, in the Bhagavad Gita, we can clearly understand from the Bhagavad Gita that if a person becomes angry, kama esha, krodha esha, rajo guna samut bhava. It is a product of rajo guna. So, kama is a product of rajo guna. Whereas, please put your mobiles on silent mode, it disturbs the class. Whereas, yeah, the material qualities a person displays, like kama, krodha, are the product of rajo guna. Krishna's qualities are not a product of any of the good qualities. his gunas, his gunatita, he is above the material modes. So when Lord appears as, Absolute Truth appears as Narasimha, he displays anger that is not a result of rajoguna, because he is completely transcendental to the modes. Then what is that anger? That anger is actually one of the transcendental reciprocation of the Lord with his devotees. Transcendental reciprocation. Just like Hiranyakashipu, he was giving so much trouble to Pradhan, even though Pradhan was his own son. And the only fault of this boy was that he was chanting the holy names of the Supreme Lord, Vishnu, Narayana.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Hiranyakashipu's persecution of Prahlad and the Lord's anger, emphasizing the Lord's affection for his unalloyed devotee.

And Hiranyakashipu, with some misunderstanding, thought that Vishnu or Narayana is his enemy. So Hiranyakashipu was telling his son, Why are you glorifying or chanting the name of my enemy? So Pradhan tried to explain very gently, very patiently, very nicely, Vishnu is not your enemy. Vishnu is nobody's enemy. Vishnu is everybody's best friend, topmost well-wisher, surudam sarva bhutana. But Hiranyakashipu, who would not try to understand, would not agree, he only became more and more angry and more and more inimical to Pradhan. So out of his anger, inimical attitude, he began to give trouble to Pradhan. So much so that the boy was tortured. He was tortured mercilessly. And that made the Lord very angry against Hiranyakashipu. Why did you torture my son, my devotee? Why did you torture your son, my devotee? So when the Lord displays anger, it is transcendental anger, out of his affection for his devotees. So Prabhupada mentions here in this Papal, the Lord has unlimited numbers of transcendental qualities and one of them is his affection for his unalloyed devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the impersonalist view of oneness and refutes it by highlighting the difference between the creator (Vishnu) and the created (Brahma).

So very long, but forth we will go through this parvo, which we will go through. So every one time we will discuss that in the afternoon and speak of it in the afternoon. Thank you very much. Parvo, we should note very carefully that the personality of Godhead is addressing Lord Brahma and specifying with great emphasis himself, pointing out that it is he, the personality of Godhead, who existed before the creation. It is he only who maintains the creation and it is he only who remains after annihilation of the creation. Brahma is also a creation. Brahma is the creation of the Supreme God. The impersonalist puts forth a theory of oneness in the sense that Brahma, also being the same principle of I, because he is an emanation from the I, the Absolute Truth, is identical with the Lord, the principle of I. And that is, does nothing more than the principle of I as explained in these words. Accepting the argument of the impersonalist, it is to be admitted that the Lord is the Creator I and that the Brahma is the Created I. Therefore, there is a difference between the two Is, namely the Predominator I and the Predominated I. Therefore, there are still two Is. Even accepting the argument of the impersonalist, the impersonalist, but we must note carefully that these two Is are accepted in the Vedic literature, the Kadopanishad, in the sense of quality. The Kadopanishad says, nithyo nityanam cetanas cetavanam ego vahunam yog vidhati karmanam.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the four questions asked by Brahma and explains that these questions are answered in the four verses of the Yatushloki Bhagavatam.

Lord Vishnu is answering Brahma. Brahma has asked four questions. What are the four questions Brahma has answered? Anathapuram Chitência, King of Pandavas and King of Pandavas. Anathapuram Chitência, King of Pandavas and King of Pandavas and King of Pandavas. The first question we are asked is, what are the forms of the Lord in matter and in transience? Rupa. Form. What are the forms of the Lord in matter and in transience? Second question is, how are the different energies of the Lord working? So remember these four questions because that will give a lot of clarity as to what is it that Vishnu is trying to answer. He is trying to answer specific questions asked by Brahma. So the answers will make a lot of sense if you know the questions. So the first question is, what are the forms of the Lord in matter and in transience? Second is, how are the energies of the Lord working? Third is, how does the Lord play with these different energies? You see in the interaction of the energies, there is a certain control exercised by somebody or something above and beyond these energies. So Brahma's question is, how does the Lord play with these energies? And fourth question of Brahma is, how may Brahma be instructed? Discharge the duty and respect between the two. How should be the duty given? A certain duty that is given to Brahma. And how should it be discharged? So these four questions will be systematically answered in the four verses called the Yatushloki Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "The essence of the Bhagavatam was spoken by Vishnu to Brahma in these four verses."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the essence of the Bhagavatam was spoken by Vishnu to Brahma in four verses, emphasizing the importance of hearing to realize the Absolute Truth.

According to the Acharyas, the entire Bhagavatam can be summarized in four verses. In four verses. Now those four verses are the verses beginning with this present verse. Second canto, ninth chapter, thirty-third, thirty-fourth, thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth verses. Four verses, four Yatushloki Bhagavatam. And it is said by the Acharyas that Lord Vishnu spoke the Bhagavatam to Brahma in these four verses. The essence of the Bhagavatam was spoken by Vishnu to Brahma in these four verses. Specifically answered in Brahma's four verses. So the answer begins with Lord Vishnu telling Brahma that all of me, my transcendental existence, my form, my colors, my qualities, my activities, everything let it be awakened in you by factual realization of my causeless mercy. That was the thirty-second verse. And in the thirty-third verse that realization is being given by the Lord's grace. This is the philosophy of the Bhagavatam. Simply if you hear Bhagavatam, you realize the Absolute Truth. Especially Bhagavatam's presence, the Absolute Truth as the personality of God. So you realize the highest aspect of the Absolute Truth simply by hearing. Just like Brahma realized simply by hearing from Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "Our false ego is the filter that is actually coming in the way of our proper hearing."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of hearing properly from the right source, emphasizing the role of Sadhana Bhakti in purifying consciousness and clearing false ego.

The important thing is that there is a certain way of hearing and also the hearer has to select the proper source. So two things for realization. One is you hear properly. And second is you hear from the right source. So Brahma had prepared himself to hear by performing Tapasya. That way Brahma prepared himself. Secondly Brahma was hearing from, directly from the personality of God, Vishnu himself. So we should also prepare ourselves to hear the Bhagavatam by undergoing the process of Sadhana Bhakti. What does Sadhana Bhakti do? It purifies our consciousness of all the misconceptions we may have. When we hear, we hear from a filter. What is that filter? What is the filter that comes between our hearing and what is actually being discovered in our heart? Huh? False ego. Our false ego is the filter that is actually coming in the way of our proper hearing. False ego is a set of misconceptions that we have about the Self, about God, about this world, about anything. So these misconceptions in the form of false ego have to be cleared. So when you practice Sadhana Bhakti and practice Yoga Yuktena, then your false ego is cleared.

**Verse References:** SB 1.2.6

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Hear about Krishna from the Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how the hearing process, when properly applied, purifies consciousness, breaks the knot of material existence, and terminates the chain of action and reaction.

In the beginning of the Bhagavatam this process is described. The process begins with hearing. And this hearing process, if it is properly applied, it results in purification of the consciousness to the extent that this knot of material existence, ahankara, is cut to pieces. All doubts about who you are, who is God, who is your relationship, what is this world, everything is cleared. Chid yate sarvasam shayah. Chi yate jah si karvani. Then the chain of rooting action is completely terminated. We are caught up in this chain of action and reaction. We have performed some actions in the past of which we are experiencing reactions. These reactions prompt us to do further actions. And that gives rise to further reactions. So we have got up in this network of actions and reactions. So to get us out of this network, Bhagavatam says, srimad-am svaratham krsnama Hear about Krishna from the Bhagavatam. So this sadhana bhakti process is the preparation for hearing for the sake of and the souls, what are the souls? The Lord or the Lord's bona fide representation. So we have to select carefully the souls from which we hear. So in this case we are hearing from Prabhupada who is coming in parampara. From Krishna. So when we hear from Prabhupada then we can actually realize. So here Krishna is explaining to Brahman. Vishnu is explaining to Brahman.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Vishnu's existence before creation, even before material nature, highlighting that He exists beyond cause and effect.

He is telling one fundamental truth that it is the person in Godhead, Vishnu himself who was existing before the creation when there was nothing but himself. So before the creation there was no material world. There were no created beings. Only the Lord existed. The personality of Krishna. He existed. Nor was there the material nature the cause of this creation. The material nature was nothing. The material nature was not there. Sad asat param. Sad in this case refers to the effect. Effect is what we see around us. The material world. It is an effect of the cause. Cause is asat. What is that? Material nature. This is the difficulty in understanding this world. That the cause and effect both are material nature itself. So how can one understand that the cause and effect are the same? Very difficult to understand. Actually even though the cause of this material creation is material nature still material nature is not independently the cause for this creation. That we explain in detail. Anyway. So here Vishnu is telling Sad asat param He existed before the creation. He also existed when there was no cause of the creation. Even material nature which is the cause was not existing. Sad asat param. Cause and effect beyond cause and effect.

**Key Quote:** "That which you see now is also I the personality of God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vishnu remains present during and after creation, addressing the Mayavadi argument that Brahma is the same identical 'I' as the Absolute Truth.

He exists beyond cause and effect. That which you see now is also I the personality of God. Now the creation is already come into existence and Vishnu is very much there. He was existing before the creation. What happens to him during the existence of the creation? He remains. He does not disappear. He does not transform. He does not become affected. He does not change. So he remains even after the creation has taken place. And after annihilation the whole creation will disappear. After that what remains will also be I the personality of God. Vishnu only will remain after the creation of this world. So in particular Prabhupada is explaining one point in this first paragraph that we understand that what he is saying carefully. That in person they say with respect to these words they are arguing this that Brahma is an emanation is coming out of Vishnu. Right? Brahma is gone from Vishnu and again into the creation. So that Brahma is the same principle of I, Aham. Here the word used is Aham evaasam evaadhe paschal aham naanyat yatsarasat param paschal aham so vashi shreka so asmi aham So this word Aham is emphasized I Vishnu is speaking and he is saying I I exist in this world I am present now I will remain after the destruction So the mayavadi argument is that the I is the same I which is the absolute truth which exists before the creation which remains during the creation and which remains after the whole creation and destroyed Brahma is also that same identical I the same I

**Key Quote:** "So there are two distinct I's here, the creator and the creator itself the creator and the created"
**Summary:** The speaker refutes the idea that Brahma and Vishnu are identical, emphasizing the distinction between the creator and the created, the predominator and the predominated.

So our Acharyas explain Yes, even if he accepts the mayavadi argument Brahma is also the same I because an emanation from that original I original Vishnu Brahma is emanation Brahma is coming from Vishnu So even assuming that the mayavadi argument that Brahma is an emanation therefore the same I we have to note that Brahma is a created I a created entity and Vishnu is the creator So there are two distinct I's here the creator and the creator itself the creator and the created So that is explained here as the difference between the two I's is the predominator and the predominated Brahma is subordinate Vishnu is the master Brahma is the subordinate created Vishnu is the creator Vishnu is the controller Brahma is the controlled This difference exists and therefore we cannot accept that both are identical in all respects 100% No Brahma and Vishnu are not identical in all respects

So in the Vedas it is said in the Kathopanishad the similarity between the creation and the creator is described as Nithyo Nithyana Between Brahma and Vishnu the similarity is Nithyo Nithyana Both are Nithya Both are Chetanas Chetanas Chetanana But the difference is there are two categories of Nithya and two categories of Chetana Nithya means eternal Chetana means conscious Two categories of eternals and two categories of conscious beings What is the difference? The next line says Eko bahunam yodhya dhyanti kamaan The one singular eternal conscious being is the maintainer of the many Conscious eternal means Eko bahunam Eka the one Nithya Chetana Distinction is made very clearly One and many Singular and plural Nithyo Nithyana Chetanas Chetanana Eko bahunam Very clear Singular and plural So plural are the many living entities and singular is Vishnu Singular is Vishnu So Vishnu is the maintainer of all the created beings the many living entities So Vishnu is the maintainer All others are maintained Even though both are eternal and conscious beings So the difference is clearly brought out in the domination And that difference will be pointed out by Vishnu to Brahma also in these four places

He would do it without any difficulty. Without any elaborate arrangements. Very very very simple way. He was always absorbed in hari bhajana. He is called bhajananandi. Bhajananandi means. Somebody who can completely absorb themselves 24 hours a day in meditation on the Supreme Lord Krishna. Through performing bhajana. Through performing kirtan or japa. Or through hearing about the glories. Or through singing the glories of the Lord. In this way. Always absorbed in that. Now Gaurav Vishwanath Babaji Maharaj was ill-trained. He did not know how to read and write. That means he did not undergo formal education. But he would always carry with him two books. Written by Harathamdas Thakur. Prema Bhakti Chandrika and Prarthana. These are two books written by Harathamdas Thakur. It is a collection of songs written by Harathamdas Thakur. Now in these two books. The entire philosophy of Krishna Consciousness is very nicely explained. Harathamdas Thakur has written a simple bengali. He has written a lot of songs. And in these songs he explains the philosophy of Krishna Consciousness. Which is there in Sanskrit. In so many Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavatam, Bhagavad Gita. All that philosophy. He has explained in very simple bengali language through these songs. So Gaurav Vishwanath Babaji Maharaj would always be carried with him these two books. Apart from these two books. He had on his body one Nandi Mala made of Tulsi. And another Japa Mala made of Tulsi beads. And the cloth he was using to wrap his body. That's all he was carrying with him. So he was very very renowned. Even though he was not literate. Still all the conclusions of the Shastras. Of the Krishna Consciousness philosophy. Was always illuminated in his heart. When somebody would approach him. And ask some philosophical doubt. He would give the answer with such clarity. All the conclusions he made. So he used to guide those who used to approach him.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Gaurav Vishwanath Babaji Maharaj's disinterest in material benefits and recounts the story of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur seeking Diksha from God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj.

And sometimes when some materialistic people would try to get his blessings. For some material benefit. He would not so much be interested. In giving such benediction for material advancement. So he would go away from clean places. And he would sit next to a toilet. Or a drink. That drink means specifically where somebody passes through. It could be very smelly. It could be dirty. It could be bad. So he would sit next to that place and chant. So that nobody would disturb him. So he did not so much say. So he did not so much like. People coming to him for some material benefit. And he never liked to accept service from other devotees. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. When he wanted to take Diksha. His father came to know Thakur. He approached his father and said I want Diksha. So his father directed him to God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj. He said go to God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj and take Diksha.

He would not respond to this request. So but repeatedly. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur approached God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj. Then one day. God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj said. I will ask my Lord. And. Depending on. His reply. I shall tell you. Whether I can initiate you or not. So after telling this. Again. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur was waiting. For a reply. So one day he asked. What did your Lord say? So then. God Kishodad Babaji Maharaj said. That. He would not be interested. In giving Diksha. He would not accept service. From anyone. So if he has to give Diksha. He has to accept service from the disciple. So since he did not want to accept service from anybody. He wanted to be only engaged in serving. Not in accepting service. Therefore he did not want to give Diksha.

**Key Quote:** "Then the Lord enlightens the devotee from within."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj was enlightened from within and could easily recognize imposter devotees.

Satatayuttana. So this is particularly. Applicable for. Guru Ekshitarayo Bhajan. Krishna. Who. Seated as. Paratma. In the heart. Of the devotee. He enlightens. The devotee. From within. If the devotee. Is engaged. devotional service to the Lord. He is constantly engaged with love and devotion in serving the Lord. Then the Lord enlightens the devotee from within. There is no need for the devotee to study externally anything. So, Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj was enlightened from within by the Lord. So, that was his position. He was fully enlightened. And he was fully renounced. So, it is said in the Bhagavatam that these two factors are very important for self-realization. What is that? Jnana and Vairantya. Jnana is enlightenment and Vairantya is renunciation. Both of them were seen in the personality of Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj to the highest degree. He was fully enlightened and he was fully renounced. And therefore, many, many great saintly persons actually took shelter of Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj by actually enquiring from Gaurav Krishna. By getting clarification and so many doubts. Also, Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj could easily recognize an imposter devotee. Sometimes people pose as if they are great devotees. Though within their heart, they are not purified of material meditation. They pose externally as if they are renounced. But actually in their heart, they have so open desire for enjoyment daily. So, when such imposters would approach Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj, he would immediately expose them. So, it was well known in the holy dham that any imposter will get exposed if he goes to Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj. So, nobody could cheat him. Nobody could display false renunciation in front of Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj. So, he was very, very, very advanced Paramahansa.

But he led a very, very simple life. He was renunciation personified. And today is the disappearance day, anniversary of his divine birth. So, we pray to him that by his mercy, we may develop renunciation and we may get enlightenment in Krishna consciousness. By his mercy. So, these Acharyas like him are very, very merciful to those who sincerely seek their blessings, seek their mercy. So, such important days we observe, especially remembering the great qualities. So, that Prana Mantra, first line I explained. Namo Govrisho Raya Saksham Vairagam Uttayam The next two lines are Vipralambara Sampode He was situated, Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj were situated in service, in the mood of separation from Krishna. It's called Vipralambara Sampode. Krishna is served by those who are advanced devotees, who have developed their relationship with Krishna. They serve Krishna in two ways. One is in association with Krishna they serve Krishna. And other one is in separation from Krishna they serve Krishna. Just like Krishna when he appeared in Vrindavan. So, when he was, as long as he was in Vrindavan, the Prajavasis were serving him in association. And when he left Vrindavan and went to Mathura and Dwarka, he was away from Vrindavan. All the Prajavasis were serving Krishna in separation from Krishna. So, these are two ways of serving the Lord. So, Gaurav Krishna and Bhavani Maharaj was always serving Krishna. In separation from him. Vipralambara Sampode. So, there is a certain mellow taste to be experienced by a devotee in such service. Vipralambara Sampode. So, he is the expert Acharya who served Krishna in Vipralambara Sampode. So, Vipralambara Sampode, Bada Pujariya Dena Maharaj who wrote a speech of such an exalted Paramahansa, Devotee, I offer my respect to all the Sages. Let's start.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the Chatur Shloki Bhagavatam, emphasizing its importance as a summary of the entire Bhagavatam and highlighting Srila Prabhupada's elaborate purports on these verses.

The 18,000 verses, Bhagavatam has 18,000 verses. Padhunetta aayira, correct? In Tamil you say that. Like naala aayira devya prabandham, padhunetta aayira Bhagavatam. That has been summarized in 4 verses, just 4 verses. So these 4 verses are very, very, very, very, very important. You can understand the whole of Bhagavatam just by studying these 4 verses. So for these verses, Srila Prabhupada has written very, very elaborate purports. And these 4 verses bring out the essence of the philosophy of the Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is presenting the philosophy of God. So that philosophy has been very nicely explained in these 4 verses. So which are those 4 verses? They are the verses beginning with the 2nd canto 9th chapter 33rd verse up to 36th verse: 33, 34, 35, and 36. So these 4 verses we'll spend more time on than on the other verses. We have already begun this verse in the last class. So I will continue with this same verse this class, and probably it will go on for a few more classes. So we are reciting the 33rd verse of the 2nd canto 9th chapter.

**Key Quote:** "Understanding, learning, understanding and realizing through hearing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the background of Srimad Bhagavatam as the last work of Vyasa Deva, who compiled the Vedic literature and transitioned it from oral tradition (Shruti) to written form.

Now a certain background for this verse is that the Srimad Bhagavatam is the last work of Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva compiled the Vedic literature as we have it today. Because before Vyasa Deva compiled the Vedic literature, what was available was only in the form of Shruti. The Vedas were available as that which was heard and passed on through oral tradition. Oral tradition means the Guru will speak, the disciple will hear, and as soon as the disciple hears, he will commit to memory. Just he hears once and he commits to memory and he is able to remember the rest of the verse. And after hearing from the Guru and committing to memory, the disciple will try to understand the meaning of what is heard from the Guru, and then he will deliberate on the meaning and ask questions from the Guru and try to understand and realize this subject matter of the Vedas. This is called Shrutapantha: understanding, learning, understanding, and realizing through hearing.

**Key Quote:** "In Kali Yuga, people's duration of life, memory and so many other such good qualities are reduced."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the characteristics of Kali Yuga, including the reduction in lifespan and memory, which prompted Vyasa Deva to put the Vedas in writing.

Now in the beginning of Kali Yuga, Vyasa Deva appeared for a very specific reason. He could see that in Kali Yuga, people's memory will be very short-lived. Their lifespan also will be reduced. In Kali Yuga, people's duration of life is shortened. So the Bhagavatam explains, in Sakya Yuga, the duration of life was 100,000 years, 1 lakh years. And that duration of life reduced in Treta Yuga, the next Yuga, to 10,000 years. Further reduced in the next Yuga, called Dwapar Yuga, to 1,000 years. And in Kali Yuga, the last of the four Yugas, in the cycle of four Yugas, the last Yuga, Kali Yuga, it is further reduced to 100 years. So the duration of life being reduced, the time available for studying the Vedas is also very less. Not only that, people's memory has also become less. In Kali Yuga, duration of life, memory, and so many other such good qualities are reduced.

**Key Quote:** "He divided the one Veda into four."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Vyasa Deva put the Vedas into writing and divided the single Veda into four parts: Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda.

So Vyasa Deva, foreseeing this condition of human beings in Kali Yuga, he first of all decided to put the Vedas in writing. So Vedas were put into writing at the end of Dwapar Yuga, just before the beginning of Kali Yuga, by Vyasa Deva. The name Vyasa is actually a title. It is a title which indicates that one who records, one who puts down in writing and creates a record, Vyasa is a title. Actually, the Vyasa title is given to the incarnation of the Lord who appeared at the end of Dwapar Yuga, Krishna Dwaipaayana Vyasa. His full name is Krishna Dwaipaayana Vyasa. He is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord who has appeared for a very special purpose. The first of the reasons is that he put down the Vedas in writing. He put down the Vedas in writing. Then also, he saw that the Vedas are very, very vast. Even if the written Vedas are available for people, still he decided to divide the one Veda into four. What did he do? He divided the one Veda into four. And that is how we have the four divisions of the Vedas called Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda.

**Key Quote:** "The Upanishad portion of each of the Vedas contains the essence of the philosophy of the Vedic knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Vyasa Deva further summarized the four Vedas into Upanishads, which contain the essence of Vedic philosophy, noting that there are 108 principal Upanishads.

Why did he do this division? He saw that in the Vedas, there are different portions which describe different things. So he logically divided the one Veda into four. Thereby, people can take up only the portion that is relevant for them and learn and study only that portion. So Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda, he divided the one Veda into four. But even that, one fourth of the entire Vedas that he divided was also very, very big. It was not small. So he further summarized each of those four divisions of Vedas into what is called as Upanishads. Vedas contain many different details called Brahmana, Aranyaka, Samhita, and Upanishads. All these different sections of the Vedas, for each of the Vedas, Rig Veda has its own Brahmana, Aranyaka, Samhita, and Upanishads. Yajur Veda has its own Brahmana, Aranyaka, Samhita, and Upanishads. Similarly, Sama Veda and Atharva Veda. So the Upanishad portion of each of the Vedas contains the essence of the philosophy of the Vedic knowledge. The Upanishad portion contains the philosophy, and it is also in the form of the essence of the philosophy. So the Upanishads also are many. There are 108 principal Upanishads. How many?

**Key Quote:** "That cream of the cream is called Vedanta Sutra."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vyasa Deva further condensed the Upanishads into the Vedanta Sutra, which is described as the 'cream of the cream' and the ultimate summary of Vedic knowledge.

108 important or principal Upanishads. So Upanishads also are very, very big in number. So even those 108 Upanishads, in Kali Yuga, people will not be able to study. 108 Upanishads. Very big number. So what did Vyasa Deva do? He further summarized all the Upanishads into what is called as Vedanta Sutra. The summary of the summary. The cream of the cream. Just like you boil milk, you get cream. But that cream, if you further condense, cream of the cream, further you condense, you get the real, real, real essence. That cream of the cream is called Vedanta Sutra. Upanishads are also called Vedanta. Vedanta means the conclusion of the Vedas, of the essence of the Vedas. Now essence of the Vedas as Upanishads or Vedanta is very big. Even though it is distant and made small, but still that is also not sufficiently summarized. That's what Vyasa Deva could foresee. So he further condensed the Vedanta or Upanishads into Vedanta Sutra. And that Vedanta Sutra is just some thousand short sutras, aphorisms. Sutra means like a formula. These aphorisms are very, very short and very terse. Athako brahma jinyasa is one Vedanta Sutra. Like this there are 1055 short sutras. That's what entire Vedic knowledge is summarized into this Vedanta Sutra. It's one small book. That's all. The whole Vedas, entirety of Vedas in one small book Vyasa Deva has summarized. This is the genius of Vyasa Deva.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Vyasa Deva compiled the Itihasas (historical narrations like Ramayana and Mahabharata) and Puranas to explain the Vedic message in an easily understandable way for the common people.

Very, very, very brave work. Now in summarizing the entire Vedas into this Vedanta Sutra, Vyasa Deva could also see that this summarization will not be understood properly by majority of the people. Most people cannot understand because it's very much condensed, very terse, very difficult to understand. So what he did, he first of all compiled the itihasas and puranas in order to explain the Vedic message in an easily understandable way for the common people. So itihasas and puranas. Itihasas are historical narrations, which contain some important historical incidents, but which explain through the historical incidents the Vedic message. For example, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata. These are two important itihasas. Ramayana explains or describes the life of Lord Rama. Mahabharata explains the life of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. So these two itihasas are explaining the Vedic message in the form, but presented in the form of a nice story,

**Key Quote:** "They are real stories, real incidents, historical incidents."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the stories in the Itihasas and Puranas are not imaginary but real historical incidents, distinguishing them from fictional tales.

historical narration. Now this is story, the story of Lord Rama, the story of the Pandavas. Now these stories are not imaginary, fictitious stories, just like you have Jataka tales, Aesop's fables, fairy tales. These are not like that. These itihasas, even though they are presented as stories, they are not fictitious, imaginary, concocted stories. No. They are real stories, real incidents, historical incidents. Valmiki, a great sage, he wrote the Ramayana and Vyasadeva himself, who compiled the Vedic literature, he wrote the Mahabharata. So these are two important itihasas. Now in addition to the itihasas, there are other historical narrations called the Puranas. Now Puranas are very, very, very, very ancient historical narrations. In the itihasas, it's a definite narration of a particular set of incidents in the history. There's a time of Lord Rama, Treta Yuga, Rama appeared. So that life of Lord Rama is described in the Ramayana. Or the Pandavas and Kauravas, they were living in the Dvapara Yuga, before this Kali Yuga began. So that narration is concerning that period of time, Pandavas and Kauravas. But the Puranas are little different than the itihasas. What do the Puranas contain? The Puranas contain very, very, very ancient historical narrations that go back even to the beginning of creation, or even before the creation. And Puranas also contain stories, historical narrations, but these stories are real. They are again not fabricated stories. They are real incidents, historical incidents, but they could be very, very, very old.

**Key Quote:** "In the Puranas there are definite topics which are described concerning the philosophy of the Vedas."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Puranas as very ancient historical narrations containing definite topics related to Vedic philosophy, differentiating them from the Itihasas.

And one more characteristic of the Puranas is that in the Puranas there are definite topics which are described concerning the philosophy of the Vedas. Just like Bhagavata Purana, it has ten topics. It describes the creation, the secondary creation, the planetary systems, the science of God, the maintenance of this material world, the destruction. All these topics are discussed systematically in the Bhagavata Purana. There are other categories of Puranas in which there are only five topics discussed. They are called Upapuranas. So there are Puranas which discuss, which describe ten topics and the Upapuranas describe five topics. So Puranas are in this sense different from the Itihasis. Puranas are different in what sense? That they are very ancient, historical narrations may be there in the Puranas and they contain definite topics, either ten or five. So these Itihasis and Puranas are also accepted as Vedic literature though there are some transcendentalists, some Vedic scholars, don't accept the Itihasis and Puranas as Vedic literature. But actually because they are presenting the same Vedic message in the form of historical narrations they are also accepted as Vedas. So Vyasadeva particularly compiled the Itihasis and Puranas for the sake of explaining the Vedic message in an easily understandable way for the common people.

**Key Quote:** "Atmarama means one who can be self-satisfied, does not require anything outside for his satisfaction."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Vyasa Deva's motivation for welfare activity, explaining the concept of 'Atmarama' (self-satisfied) and how even self-realized souls work for the benefit of others out of compassion.

So if you study the life of the Pandavas or study the life of Lord Rama or study the Puranas which describe different historical incidents Vishnu Purana, Garuda Purana, Bhagavata Purana, you will get the Vedic message explained in a very easily understandable way for the common people because so many stories are there, so many historical narrations are there. But in addition to these Itihasis and Puranas Vyasadeva was also not very happy or satisfied that he has done enough welfare activity. A Rishi or a Sadhu his life is dedicated for the welfare of the people in general. Because these Rishis or Sadhus as far as they are concerned because of their spiritual realization they are satisfied and happy and contented within themselves. They are Atmarama. Atmarama means one who can be self-satisfied does not require anything outside for his satisfaction. It is like all of us we require so many things externally for our satisfaction or for our happiness. Right? We are dependent on so many external things. Whereas a self-realized soul or an Atmarama a person who is Atmarama is satisfied within himself he does not require anything external for his satisfaction or happiness or contentment.

**Key Quote:** "A Sadhu or a Rishi is one who lives for the welfare of the others."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the compassionate nature of Sadhus and Rishis, highlighting Vyasa Deva's dedication to the welfare of others and his initial dissatisfaction despite his extensive work.

So what is the life of such Atmaramas? What would they do if they are self-satisfied? They have nothing to do for the sake of their satisfaction or happiness or contentment. They have nothing to do. So does it mean that they don't do anything? No. While they are themselves satisfied within themselves and they are not dependent externally on anything or any person for their satisfaction they also out of compassion for the others who are not able to actually be self-satisfied, for the welfare of the others they keep working. There are so many activities. There are so many different things they do. So a Sadhu or a Rishi is one who lives for the welfare of the others. So Vyasa Deva is a Rishi is a Sadhu whose life is only dedicated for the welfare of others. So how did he decide to do welfare activity for others? He put down the Vedas in writing. He compiled the Vedas. He did divided the Vedas into four parts. He summarized the Vedas. Further summarized and also wrote down Itihasas and Puranas. But in spite of doing all this he was not satisfied. He thought still is there something more I can do? This thought Vyasa Deva got from God before he wrote this last work or compiled the last book the Bhagavata Purana.

**Key Quote:** "You are not satisfied or you are feeling insufficient because you are not actually properly glorified Krishna in all your Vedic literature."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Narada Muni pointed out to Vyasa Deva that he had not properly glorified Krishna in his previous works, leading to the compilation of the Bhagavata Purana.

Before the Bhagavatam was compiled Vyasa Deva felt in his heart some vacuum some insufficiency some incompleteness. So when he felt that he thought that even though I have done so much of work for the welfare of the people I am still not satisfied that I have done enough. Something is lacking something is missing in what I have done. What is that I have not done? That was pointed out to him by his Guru Narada Muni. Narada Muni pointed out to Vyasa Deva that even though you have done so much of work even though you have compiled all the Vedas you have done all that you have done still and that's very big work it's not small work very big work still Vyasa Deva was experiencing dissatisfaction and Narada Muni noticed that and he told Vyasa Deva you are not satisfied or you are feeling insufficient because you are not actually properly glorified Krishna in all your Vedic literature. In all the literature you have not properly or sufficiently glorified Krishna. So Narada Muni directed Vyasa Deva to write the Bhagavatam this final contribution of Vyasa Deva the final work of Vyasa Deva the last work of Vyasa Deva in which Krishna is exclusively glorified. So Bhagavata is also called Krishna Samhita Samhita generally means Vedic literature. So Bhagavata is that Vedic literature which exclusively glorifies Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Paramahamsas are the topmost transcendentalists who have reached the perfection of spiritual realization by being able to distinguish spirit from matter."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Bhagavata Purana as 'Paramahamsa Samhita,' suitable for the topmost transcendentalists (Paramahamsas) who can distinguish spirit from matter.

Also Bhagavata is called Paramahamsa Samhita. It is the very literature which can be best appreciated by Paramahamsas. Who are Paramahamsas? Paramahamsas are the topmost transcendentalists who have reached the perfection of spiritual realization by being able to distinguish spirit from matter. There are two things in this world. There is matter that we all know and there is something which normally people do not know and that is called spirit. So one should know in addition to what is matter one should also know what is spirit. And one should be able to distinguish or separate spirit from matter. Spirit is important matter is not important. Spirit is the essence which is of value to us and matter is not essential not of value to us. Our life generally is simply centered around matter. We are leading what is called as a material life concerned only with matter, including our body which we think is our self this body also is made up of matter. And everything around us we see we deal with is made up of matter. So this matter is not the essence is not important is not essential. So spirit is important. And one who is able to distinguish spirit from matter and not only do that but also extract effectively the spiritual essence of everything in this world.

**Key Quote:** "How to extract the spiritual essence from everything material. That is only known to a Paramahamsa."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that a Paramahamsa can extract the spiritual essence from the mixture of spirit and matter, highlighting their ability to find value beyond the material world.

Like whatever we see in existence including this body which we think is our self how to extract the spiritual essence from everything material. That is only known to a Paramahamsa. The real topmost transcendentalist. He knows why in this world how to extract the spiritual essence of everything. There is a mixture of matter and spirit. So from this mixture just like Hamsa why they are called Paramahamsa? Another reason is Hamsa swam is a very very special bird. What is the special quality of the Hamsa? It can separate milk from a mixture of milk and water. Just like generally the milkman when he brings milk to your house he will generally if you take from a person who milks a cow generally they add milk to the water and give you. Water mixed with milk. Now if you present that water mixed with milk to a swam it will definitely drink that milk but it will only drink the milk portion. It will leave behind water. The swam has got this special quality. Means it is able to take the essence of the mixture of the milk and water. What is the essence? The milk. So it is able to take the nectar the amrita and leave behind the water. Similarly a Paramahamsa is a person who can extract the spiritual essence from a mixture of spirit and matter. So not only he can separate spirit from matter but he can also take the spiritual essence from a mixture of spirit and matter. So such a Paramahamsa specially for a Paramahamsa Vyasa Deva has compiled this Sriman Bhagavatam. So therefore this Bhagavatam is also called

**Key Quote:** "The author who has compiled the Vedanta Sutra himself has explained the Vedanta Sutra in the form of Sriman Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the Bhagavatam is the author's own commentary on the Vedanta Sutra, making it crucial for understanding the correct meaning of the sutras.

Paramahamsa Samhita. It is also the literature which is the commentary or the explanation of the Vedanta Sutra by the author himself. As I said Vedanta Sutra is the cream of the cream. So it is very difficult to understand. For most people this Vedanta Sutra is difficult to understand. And even those who try to study the Vedanta Sutra after studying Sanskrit after studying the other Vedic literature they may misunderstand the meaning of the Sutras. There is a possibility that somebody even if they study in a scholarly way the Vedic literature and try to understand the meaning of the Vedanta Sutra they may misunderstand the meaning. In order to explain correctly the meaning of the Vedanta Sutra the author who has compiled the Vedanta Sutra himself has explained the Vedanta Sutra in the form of Sriman Bhagavatam. Therefore the Bhagavatam is so important in the literature. It is the ultimate Vedic book book of the Vedas book of the Vedic knowledge because it contains the cream of the cream of the Vedas and it also is presented in the form of a Purana Purana means historical narration so there are many Vedic books that contain the cream of the Vedanta Sutra so there are nice historical incidents described which make it very interesting. In the Vedanta Sutra there is no historical narration so it is very dry no stories no historical incidents it is very dry. So this Bhagavatam which explains the Vedanta Sutra is presented in a very unique format of a Purana. Also it explains the Vedanta Sutra which may be misunderstood by even some great scholars. So the author himself is explaining the Vedanta Sutra what is the meaning of the sutras in this Bhagavatam. Therefore this Bhagavatam is the most important Vedic literature.

**Key Quote:** "It is recommended to study the Bhagavad Gita."
**Summary:** The speaker recommends studying the Bhagavad Gita as a preliminary step before studying the Bhagavatam, highlighting the Gita's importance as the essence of all Upanishads.

But the Bhagavatam is also not recommended to be studied directly or as the first book because it explains the Vedanta Sutra it is not again to be studied as the first book. So preliminary study of the Bhagavatam it is recommended to study the Bhagavad Gita. It is very impressive literature. What is the special position of the Bhagavad Gita? Just like Bhagavatam has got a very special position from all various literatures the Bhagavad Gita also has got a very special position. What is that? The Bhagavad Gita is the essence of all the Upanishads. So just like the Vedanta Sutra is the essence of all the Upanishads the Bhagavad Gita also is an essence of all the Upanishads. And Bhagavad Gita is presented as a conversation or a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna and it is also the essence of all the Upanishads. The Bhagavad Gita also is a very important Vedic literature. So the study of Bhagavad Gita as the preliminary study of the Bhagavatam and the actual study of the Bhagavatam itself are the Vedas these two books which are the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. If you study the Bhagavad Gita and you study the Bhagavatam you know the Vedas entirely what they are actually communicating. The entire Vedic message Vedic philosophy

is there as a part of the Mahabharata. Because when Vyasa Deva compiled the Mahabharata Mahabharata also is a very very big work. Mahabharata contains one lakh verses. How many? One lakh verses are there in the Mahabharata. So Vyasa Deva also wanted to summarize the Mahabharata and give the essence of the Vedic philosophy in the Mahabharata and in the Vedic philosophy. So Vyasa Deva also wanted to summarize the essence of the teachings of the Vedas which is explained elaborately in the Mahabharata in the form of Bhagavad Gita. Therefore what did Vyasa Deva do?

in the Bhagavad Gita but even that Bhagavad Gita is actually interpreted in so many ways Krishna's words are interpreted not taken directly into interpretation because of which Krishna is not understood properly but the Bhagavad Gita is exclusively glorifying Krishna exclusively describing who is Krishna so therefore Bhagavad Gita is very very important now that Krishna who he is is explained in the Bhagavad Gita also in four verses called the Jatashloki Bhagavatam now Krishna is speaking to Brahma and Krishna is telling who he is in these four verses so that is explained in the four verses and that is the essence of the entire Bhagavatam and the Bhagavatam is specially glorifying or describing or explaining who is Krishna and according to the Bhagavatam and according to the Bhagavad Gita Krishna is the absolute truth he is the supreme person he is a transcendental personality he is not an ordinary person he is the ultimate source of everything described in the Bhagavad Gita as Aam Sarvasya Prabhavo described in the Vedanta Sutra described in the Bhagavatam as Aham eva Sam eva Gre in this verse so he is the supreme person he is the transcendental personality he is the absolute truth he is the source of everything

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a mango fruit and its juice to explain 'Rasa,' comparing it to the nectarian essence that is even more relishable than the fruit itself.

Rasa means the nectarian essence of a fruit just like you got a mango fruit you relish eating the mango fruit but you can even go relish drinking the mango juice correct mango juice right even in a fruit fruit is relishable but what is the most relishable part of the fruit the nectarian juice Amruta so what Shukadeva Goswami has done is the Bhagavatam which is like the ripened fruit of the Vedic tree of knowledge right the best part of the tree is the fruit the essence of the tree is there in the seed right if you take a banyan tree inside the banyan seed is a whole tree right so the seed can be considered to be the essence of the tree so the entire tree you can say is there in the seed so the essence of the tree is the seed but seed is not necessarily the most relishable part of a tree what is the most relishable part of a tree the fruit now the fruit it is the most relishable part of a tree even more better than the seed because not only contains the essence of the tree but it also contains the most relishable part of the tree

if you take a mango fruit you can nicely relish it also contains the most relishable part of the tree but even more valuable is the nectarine juice of the fruit the rasam rasam is even more valuable than the fruit if you have fruit you take the juice that is even more relishable even the fruit right so that rasam is presented by yasadeva and that rasam has become more relishable by coming out of the lips of shukadeva swami what has shukadeva swami done this is to make more relishable more material by making it easily palatable for all classes of men otherwise bhagavatam could have been relished only by some people typically bhagavatam is only relished by the paramahamsas that's why everyone can relish the bhagavatam if they hear from the lips of shukadeva swami so that is the special contribution of shukadeva swami

**Key Quote:** "Just like a parrot makes the mango very, very, very, very relishable, more nectarean, Shukadeva Goswami made this Bhagavatam more relishable."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Shukadeva Goswami is called 'Shuka' (parrot), drawing a parallel between a parrot making a mango more relishable and Shukadeva Goswami making the Bhagavatam more relishable through his narration.

now why his name is shuka because it is said that people in the past you must take care of his name which is his name shukadeva swami for his body and life the lion and the fennec and the tiger that is promised then it is seen in his head before the it is a monkey it is a snake and he is a few birds of the then the fruit becomes even more sweeter. A mango fruit touched by the beak of a parrot becomes even more relishable. Fruit by itself is relishable. A ripened mango fruit by itself is relishable. But if a parrot touches it, parrot's beak touches it, parrot's mouth touches it, then it becomes even more relishable. Similarly, Bhagavatam, because it contains the rasa, bhakti rasa, it is relishable. It is very relishable. But it became more so when it came out of the mouth of Shukadeva Goswami. Just like a mango fruit when touched by the beak of a parrot becomes very relishable. Therefore, the name of the son of Vyasadeva who presented the Bhagavatam is called Shuka, compared to a parrot. Just like a parrot makes the mango very, very, very, very relishable, more nectarean, Shukadeva Goswami made this Bhagavatam more relishable by speaking the Bhagavatam to Parishad Mahabharata. So that conversation we are studying. In that conversation, this important aspect of who is Krishna is explained, the philosophy of who is Krishna, who is Krishna is explained in these four verses. So we will go through this little slowly and try to understand. I will stop here.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Paramahamsa stage, emphasizing pure devotion to Krishna and explaining how the essence of sannyasa is adapted for preaching in Kali Yuga.

As the Paramahamsa is above all varnas and all ashramas, he's a pure devotee. Devotees who are fully devoted to serving Krishna without caring for any personal comforts, they are actually paramahamsas. So these strict rules of sannyas are not possible to be followed in Kali Yuga. Therefore, in Kali Yuga it is said sannyas is forbidden, but even the followers of Chaitanya, they accept the essence of this principle of sannyas, which is traveling and preaching, and some minimum rules of sannyas are accepted, but not all the rules, so that the preaching can be done without much difficulty, and that's our main business.

**Key Quote:** "If by scholarship one does not gain such devotion, then how will that learning help him?"
**Summary:** Srivas Thakur, considered an incarnation of Narada Muni, emphasizes the importance of devotion over mere scholarship, advising a young Nimai Pandit to worship Krishna.

Sri Srivas Pandit is described as the incarnation of Narada Muni. Through Srivas Thakur, Lord Chaitanya taught that he is conquered by the love of his devotees and how anyone who is dear to his devotee also conquers his heart. Srivas Pandit appeared at Biyani Bazar in Shilha district as the second son of Sri Jaladhar Pandit. It is mentioned in Chaitanya Charita Amrita that Srivas had three brothers: Sri Rama, Sri Pati, and Sri Nidhi. But Jaladhar Pandit had an older son named Nalina Pandita who disappeared when the family lived in Biyani Bazar. When Srivas was 12 years old, Jaladhar took his family to Navadvipa and remained there. Because young Nimai Pandit seemed to have grown arrogant by his scholarship, one day Srivas told him, "Why do you people undertake study so that they might understand what is devotion to Sri Krishna? If by scholarship one does not gain such devotion, then how will that learning help him? It simply becomes a tedious endeavour which in the end is nothing but a waste of time. If you have actually learned something, then begin your worship of Sri Krishna now." Nimai laughed and replied, "By your mercy certainly that will come to be. If you are all kind enough to me,"

Shortly thereafter, Mahaprabhu journeyed to Gaya where he accepted initiation from Sri Eswara Puri. The Lord did so to teach that, without the blessings and guidance of great souls and without the prayers of great Vaishnavas, beseeching Krishna to extend his mercy to us, there is no hope of our really receiving the mercy of Krishna. Lord Krishna was born in Mathura but performed his most intimate pastimes in Vrindavan. Similarly, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was born in the house of Jagannath Mishra,

**Summary:** The story of Srivas Thakur's son's death during kirtan highlights his extraordinary detachment and devotion to Lord Chaitanya, leading to a benediction of prosperity.

One night while Lord Gauranga was engaged in Kirtan, the son of Srivas Thakur who was suffering from fever left his body. The lady started weeping very loudly. Srivas Thakur on hearing the news, quickly ran into the room and found his son's dead body. He told the ladies to give up this crime, that there should be no grief, that even a most sinful person who dies while hearing the holy name and glories of Krishna will be liberated. He told them, "My son is so fortunate to have left his body hearing the harinam and kirtan of Lord Chaitanya and his devotees. Now if you wish to cry, do it silently in your own heart. But do not tell anyone what has happened because if you disturb the ecstatic dancing of my Lord Gauranga, then I will tie a pot around my neck and drown myself in the Ganges today." After speaking all these words, Srivas Thakur went back into the kirtan and with a big smile on his face began dancing with Lord Chaitanya and Vaishnavas. The kirtan went on throughout the entire night. When Mahaprabhu came to know of the passing of Srivas' son, he cried tears of love and said, "How could I ever leave the association of such a pure devotee as Srivas Thakur? He loves me so much that he does not even express his gratitude. He does not even express his grief over the death of his own son." Mahaprabhu gave this benediction to Srivas: "There will never be poverty in your house. If you simply remain indoors,"

**Summary:** The speaker explains that there is no safe place in the material world and we should strive to return to the spiritual world.

If we carefully study the scriptures, we understand there is no safe place which is free from all dangers in this material existence. Material existence means anytime there can be death. So, therefore, it is only because of the influence of the illusory energy that we think that sometimes I am safe, sometimes there is danger for my life. Actually, dangers are always existing. But where is absolute safety in this material world? There is no place which is absolutely safe. So, unless we come out of illusion, we are unable to realize that we should not stay in this material world even one moment more. We should immediately get out of material existence and go to our original position.

**Key Quote:** "Ordinary people pray to Durga for material wealth, fame, profit, strength and so on. Rukmini, however, desired to have Krishna for her husband."
**Summary:** Discussion of Durga's children (Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, Kartikeya) and the difference between praying to Durga for material benefits versus pure devotion to Krishna, as exemplified by Rukmini.

So Srila Prabhupada says, Goddess Durga has four famous children. If you carefully observe the deity here, Dateshwari, Durga Devi, you can see her four children there with her. Who are the four children? Two daughters, the goddess of fortune Lakshmi and the goddess of learning Saraswati. Where we had the Guru Puja, you can more clearly see that. Extreme ends are Ganesha to your left and Kartikeya to your right, extreme right. And then Lakshmi to the left, Saraswati to the right, to your right. And, so here Prabhupada says, she has two daughters, Lakshmi and Saraswati, and she has two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya. They are all considered demigods and demigoddesses. Since goddess Durga is always worshipped with her famous children, Rukmini specifically offered her prayers to the deity in that way. However, her prayers were very special. Ordinary people pray to Durga for material wealth, fame, profit, strength and so on. Rukmini, however, desired to have Krishna for her husband. And therefore, she prayed that the deity be pleased with her and bless her with that benediction. Since she desired only Krishna, her worship of the demigods is not condemned. Then, Srila Prabhupada also says in the same chapter,

the Gopis worshipped goddess Katyaini to get Krishna as their husband. Similarly, Rukmini was thinking of the various types of demigods, not for material benefit, but in respect to Krishna. Praying to the demigods to achieve the favour of Krishna is not irregular. And Rukmini was fully absorbed in thoughts of Krishna. In the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Srila Prabhupada says about this mention of the demigods in the Brahma Samhita. Srila Prabhupada says, In the Brahma Samhita, there are mantras offering obeisances to Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma, the Sun God, Lord Ganesha, as well as Lord Vishnu, all of whom are worshipped by the impersonalists as Panchopasana. Vaishnavas can also worship all these demigods, but only on the principles of the Brahma Samhita, which is recommended by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. We may note in this connection, the mantras for worshipping Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma, Lord Durga, Sun God, and Ganesha,

he very nicely explains the details about Durga Devi. Very concisely he explains, the world in which Brahma takes his stand and hymns the Lord of Goloka. Brahma is worshipping Krishna by chanting these prayers. But here, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur explains, this world is called Devi Dhama, consisting of 14 worlds, 14 planetary systems. And Durga is its creator. She is the siding deity of the entire material universe. She is ten-armed. If you closely look here, there also you can see. She is having ten hands, representing the ten-fold fructive activities. Generally people worship Durga Devi with some material desires. And those desires that she can fulfil for this fructive people are ten kinds of different divisions of these benefits she can bestow. She rides on the lion, representing her heroic prowess. She is always riding a lion, that you can clearly see also. She tramples down Mahishasura, representing the subduer of all vices. Even though Durga is worshipped by so many asuras and so many sinful people. But she never is kind to them. She always deals with them very very sternly. So she subdues all vices by her power. She is the mother of two sons, Kartikeya and Ganesha, representing beauty and success. So people always worship materialistic people, Ganesha. For what? For success. So Ganesha represents success in this material world. And Kartikeya, you clearly see there, he is dressed like a very handsome prince. Correct? So he represents mundane beauty. So materialistic persons worship Kartikeya for bodily beauty. She is placed between Lakshmi and Saraswati, representing mundane opulence and mundane knowledge.

**Summary:** Comparison of material and spiritual opulence (Lakshmi) and knowledge (Saraswati), and the symbolism of Durga holding a snake representing destructive time (Kala).

In the material world, Lakshmi as the daughter of Durga Devi, she represents material opulence. Whereas Lakshmi in the spiritual world is actually the personification of spiritual opulence. Spiritual wealth. And similarly, Saraswati in the material world represents material knowledge. That's why in school, when we were studying at least, they used to tell us, worship Saraswati, pray to Saraswati, then you can do well in your exams of this mundane education system. So that Saraswati, whom they were referring to, ordinary people refer to, is the goddess of material knowledge. But Saraswati in the spiritual world is actually representing transcendental knowledge, not material knowledge. She is armed with twenty weapons. Of course, in this form of Durga, ten hands, she is having ten weapons. But, she is actually armed with twenty weapons, representing the various pious activities enjoined by the Vedas for suppression of the vices, suppression of all sins. Twenty different pious activities are given in the Vedas and her twenty weapons represent those twenty pious activities. She holds the snake, representing the beauty of destructive time. Snake is also called Kala Sattva. Means, Kala is always destroying. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita, 11th chapter. Kalosmi Lokakshayakrut. Shaya means destroy, destruction. So, Kala simply destroys, destroys, destroys, destroys, destroys. So, that is the symbol which she is holding. Symbolically, she is holding the snake, representing destructive time.

**Summary:** Explanation of Durga as the 'prison house' (Durga) for souls who forget Krishna, and how she purifies them through the wheel of Karma according to Govinda's will.

Such is Durga, possessing all these manifold forms. Durga is possessed of Durga. Durga means the prison house. When Jeevas, begotten of the marginal potency, Tatastha Shakti, forget the service of Krishna, they are confined in this mundane prison house, the citadel of Durga. As soon as we forget Krishna, we are imprisoned in this material world. The wheel of Karma is the incident of the material world. The wheel of Karma is the instrument of punishment at this place. Kala Chakra is also called sometimes the wheel of Karma. The work of purifying these penalized Jeevas is the duty devolved upon Durga. Even though Durga appears to be very cruel, but actually she is serving Krishna in a very peculiar way. So, she is purifying the Jeevas by giving them suitable punishment for their reformation. She is incessantly, incessantly means continuously, engaged in discharging the same by the will of Govinda. Ichchanu roopam appears as the one who carries out all her activities exactly in accordance with the will of Govinda.

The internal potency in the spiritual world and for devotees forgetful souls, conditioned souls, rebellious souls, asuras, she acts as Durga Devi external potency. The characteristics of external potency is just the opposite of the internal potency. Yoga Maya reminds everybody about Krishna. Durga and Krishna Yogamaya facilitates devotional service. Durga Devi actually puts everybody under illusion because of which they think they are the Lords. Krishna is not the Lord. There is no separate Lord. Everyone thinks I am the Lord. Under the control of Durga Devi. But because of the illusory energy, the illusion that Durga Devi puts them under, they think that they are independent. They think they are the Lords or they think they can become the Lord in case somebody else is overpowering them.

only. Therefore, for devotees in the material world, when we become devotees or when we surrender to Durga Devi, the same Durga Devi who is responsible for putting all the conditioned souls under the illusion, all the forgetful souls under the illusion, she becomes the agency for delivering the devotees. Sometimes devotees think that Durga Devi is anyway meant for putting all the obstacles or she puts obstacles on the path of their progress when they want to lord over or they want to enjoy. She creates all kinds of burdens. So, devotees sometimes think that when I am trying to do devotional service, if there is any obstacle, they think the cause is Krishna who has taken charge of the devotees, who gives a token reaction just to remind you that these desires which you are seeking fulfillment of even after becoming devotees is actually an obstacle for your path of progress in your life. You have to give up these material desires. Krishna gives a very very small reaction, a token reaction as Prabhupada says. It is very much reduced. That little reaction is to remind us that we should give up all our material desires and simply act as a master and prepare ourselves to quickly get out of this place and go to the spiritual

As devotees we can expect the mercy of Durga by worshipping Krishna. And Prabhupada says whenever devotees visit the temples of either Durga or Shiva they are servants of Krishna. They are not equal with Krishna. Therefore even if one goes to a temple of the demigods one should not accept the deities as they are accepted by the impersonalists. All of them are to be accepted as personal demigods but they all serve the order of the deities. So if one can offer respect even to an ant why not to the demigods? Prabhupada is telling you that if one can offer respect even to an immortal being then one must always know however that no demigod is equal to or above the Supreme Lord. Only Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all others including the demigods such as Lord Shiva Lord Brahma Goddess Durga are surely eternal servants of the Lord. Never consider demigods equal to or greater than Krishna but at the same time we should not fail to show proper respect to the demigods and what is that showing proper respect? We bow down to them as personalities who are devotees of Krishna and demigods in this material world. For they are placed in that position only by Krishna control us subordinate control us to

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the holy name of Krishna, his form, and pastimes are beyond material perception and manifest through sincere service and faith, purifying our consciousness and revealing spiritual reality.

There is another verse which says in Chaitanya Charitamrita: Atayiva krishnera nama deha vilasa prakritendriya grahiyanayi hai svaprakasha. The holy name of Krishna, His body, His pastimes, cannot be understood by the blunt material senses, prakritendriya grahiyanayi. Then how do you know? Hai svaprakasha, they are manifested independently. When you sincerely serve the shakti-avesha nama with attention, with transcendental faith in His unmanifest presence before you, He will purify us, and He, on His own, will manifest that Chaitanya rasa vighraha nama to our consciousness, to our spiritual senses.

At the time when Lord Buddha appeared, the people in general were atheistic and preferred animosity. They preferred animosity over the animal flesh.

**Key Quote:** "When the Vedas are not accepted through the authoritative disciplic succession, the casual readers of the Vedas are misled by the flowery language of that system of knowledge."
**Summary:** This segment explains the Vedic perspective on animal sacrifice, emphasizing the importance of understanding the Vedas through disciplic succession and the concept of reviving the sacrificed animal.

He preached that he did not believe in the tenets of the Vedas, and stressed the adverse psychological effect of non-violence incurred by animal killing. When the Vedas are not accepted through the authoritative disciplic succession, the casual readers of the Vedas are misled by the flowery language of that system of knowledge. They have no depth of knowledge. Now, animal killing is specifically allowed in the Vedic sacrifices to test the power of the mantra being chanted by a particular Brahman. What is done is an old cow or an old bull is offered in sacrifice, but after that sacrifice the animal is revived. The soul in the animal's body is getting a new body.

**Key Quote:** "Because in Shakti Avesha Nama, first you will get taste of Shakti, you get empowered without tiring."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting with attention allows us to embrace the sound of the mantra, leading to a taste of spiritual energy (Shakti) and the association of Satchidananda, although our current dull spiritual senses may hinder full appreciation.

And that embrace, when you chant and hear that very sound, you are actually embracing. That is why that taste comes, because in Shakti Avesha Nama, first you will get taste of Shakti, you get empowered without tiring. By the mercy of the Lord, you will be able to go on chanting, wanting to chant more and more. Just like if you like somebody's association, then you want more and more of that association, is it not? Similarly for us, immediately to feel that I like the association of Satchidananda, the Satchidananda is Nama on my tongue, where our spiritual senses, our spiritual mind and attention is all dull now. I told you, dreamy attention. Because of that we are not able to appreciate the presence of Satchidananda, Nama.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In the same way, even though Shakti Avesha Nama is on my tongue, if I chant and hear, I am not getting the full taste."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of rubber gloves and a hot plate, the speaker explains that our contaminated mind (Chitta) acts as a barrier, preventing us from fully experiencing the taste and benefits of chanting the holy name.

We are unable to. Yet the fact remains that something is flowing into us. Another example I have given several times is about if you wear rubber gloves on your hand and you keep it on a hot plate, you won't feel the heat. But if you hold it for some time, slowly you will feel the heat. Why? Because the heat goes through the rubber gloves and then you start feeling it. In the same way, even though Shakti Avesha Nama is on my tongue, if I chant and hear, I am not getting the full taste. Please understand, because still the rubber gloves is there. My mind is contaminated. My Chittam is contaminated. Through the contaminated, through the gloves only I am touching. My attention is coming through that and touching. So I will definitely not feel the full. Somebody asked if I have Satchidananda, why immediately I am not enlightened. So limitation is us.

Limitation is our Chitta. And then we touch the Nama of the Lord on the tongue. That is called the hearing embrace or the attention embrace. And bead after bead we will feel this warmth. I don't want to mislead you by saying that okay you will become ecstatic, bead after bead if you chant and hear that very sound. No, it will take time, but heat will come. Some heat will come. And you go on. What is that called? Embrace. Continue the attention embrace. What will happen? More and more heat as it comes, more duration you hold, more heat reaches your head. Slowly it will also melt the rubber. This exact action of the Shakti Ayesha Nama. It will melt. It will dissolve our false ego. Dissolve our illusions.

Then spiritual tongue awakens. Spiritual mind, senses, ears awaken. You can chant and hear the Shuddha Nama of the Lord, unmodified. Un是啊. Only the Shuddhas can do it. You can do it. It doesn't really matter. When you connect to the Shuddhas it doesn't matter. Any spiritual environment is the same. As long as you connect to them it is the same. Everything is in harmony. And sudden spiritual realization takes place. When you connect to the Dhamma you feel all things. As long as you connect to the Dhamma you feel all things. When you connect to the Dhamma you feel all things as well.

**Verse References:** BG 2.22
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "That change of body is called death and rebirth, punar janma."
**Summary:** The soul is immutable and undergoes transmigration, accepting new bodies upon the death of the old one, a process known as death and rebirth.

It is immutable; it does not undergo any change. Whatever changes we see are changes of the body, or even the changes that we perceive in a person are the changes in the mind. But the soul is different from the body and the mind, so the soul is unchanging; it is immutable. As a person puts on new garments, giving up old and useless ones, the soul similarly accepts new bodies, material bodies, giving up old and useless ones. So Krishna explains that when the body becomes old and useless, that is when we give up this body and we accept another new material body.

In the people, other than the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna Himself, comes and delivers the people. So, for this reason, he began to worship Krishna, particularly he chose to worship Krishna in the form of Saligram Shila. Why? There are several reasons, but two important reasons I'll mention. Saligram Shila is self-manifest, self-manifest Deity in this world. Saligram Shila is Krishna appearing in the form of a stone with certain markings, and you directly take the Saligram Shila and begin worshipping. You don't have to do what is called as Prana Pratishta. You don't have to install this Deity. This is a very, very special Deity of Krishna. Eight forms and eight different substances, we can make the Deity according to Shastra. And then after making the Deity according to scriptural directions, we have to install. Saligram Shila, no installation. Directly you take and start worshipping. So Saligram Shila is Sakshat Krishna.

Of all the Deities that you can worship, all types of Deity worship you can do, the easiest is to worship the Saligram Shila. Of course, as Krishna says, the only requirement for doing any service, devotional service of worshipping the Supreme Lord is our Bhakti. But with devotion, the Saligram Shila is to be worshipped with two items. Tudasi, I will tell you a prayer which Ajay Dacharya offered to Krishna. All of you repeat this prayer. Tudasi, dada, matrena, jalasya, chulakenava, vikrinete, swamatmanam, bhaktebhyo, bhaktavatsalaham. Now this verse was chanted by Advaita Acharya to worship Krishna in the form of Saligram Shila. Saligram Shila is very easy to please by just offering two items. Tudasi, dada, matrena. Just one leaf of Tudasi. One leaf of Tudasi. As Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, patram, pushpam, phalam, toyam, yome, bhaktya prayatchati. One can offer Krishna with devotion either a leaf or a flower or one fruit or a little water. So these two items, patram and toyam, are particularly mentioned in this prayer to Krishna. Tudasi, dada, matrena, particularly Tudasi leaf. And jalasya, chulakenava, one palmful of water. One palmful of water. Of course, the water should be Ganga Jal. But you can invoke Ganga

And just these two items, Krishna says, if it is offered with devotion, particularly to the Saligram Shila, Krishna thinks that there is nothing in my possession that is equivalent to one Tudasi leaf and a palmful of water offered with devotion by my devotee. So how does, how can Krishna reciprocate? He can't just receive whatever the devotee is offering with love and devotion and be, you know, just be just neutral about it. He has to give back something. He has to reciprocate. So Krishna considers, what can I give my devotee? My devotee will never accept anything that I give which is actually in my possession. My devotee doesn't want anything. In exchange for what the devotees offer, they don't want anything. So what can I give? And then Krishna thinks, also Krishna thinks, I have nothing in my possession which is equivalent to any of these two items. So, He Himself, vikrinete svamatmanam He sells Himself completely to His devotee. He offers Himself to His devotee. In exchange for just one Tudasi leaf and a palmful of water offered with devotion.

How to actually make sure that Krishna comes down for this purpose of delivering the whole world. So he decided to worship the Saligram Shila and based on this prayer he was sure that Krishna will definitely come down and answer my prayer if I offer the Saligram Shila with devotion just one Tudasi leaf and a palmful of water. vikrinete svamatmanam bhaktebhyo bhakta vatsalah Because Krishna is very very very very very affectionate to His devotees. Krishna is very affectionate to His devotees. So in exchange for the devotees offering one Tudasi leaf and a palmful of water, Krishna sells Himself to His devotee. When Durvasamani approached Krishna in Vaikuntha so he was seeking protection against the attack of the Sudarshan Chakra. So Vishnu said of course he approached Vishnu in Vaikuntha, Narayana. So Narayana said I am not independent I have sold myself to my devotees I am the property of my devotees. So if at all you want anything from me you have to go to my devotee. I can't give you because I am not independent I am not free. So like that actually this prayer also says Krishna sells Himself to His devotee. So therefore Krishna is the property of His pure devotees. They have got pure devotion to Him. Krishna is the property of His pure devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Desiring to understand the glory of Radharani's love."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain the three internal reasons for Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's appearance, starting with Krishna's desire to understand the glory of Radharani's love.

This describes the three internal reasons for Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's appearing in this world. So the prayer itself contains the reasons directly. Desiring to understand the glory of Radharani's love the wonderful Okay, that's the first reason. Desiring to understand the glory of Radharani's love. Now what is special about Radharani's love that even Krishna is so attracted by it and he desires to understand what is the kind of love that Radharani has for me. What is the significance of this? See, Krishna loves Radharani Radharani loves Krishna. Okay, it's mutual, reciprocal. Okay. But Krishna is actually seeing that the pleasure I experience by loving Radharani the happiness I get by loving Radharani Krishna is unlimited Lord. Everything about him is unlimited. Obviously he experiences unlimited pleasure in loving his devotees, particularly Radharani. Okay. But still Krishna feels that Radharani experiences more happiness in her devotional service to me offering her love to me her loving service than I experience in actually loving Radharani or serving Radharani or offering my reciprocation to Radharani. So he is very curious how is it that Radharani is experiencing more happiness more pleasure than me in her devotional service to me. So Krishna is unable to figure this out fathom this understand this. So in order to understand this he takes the position of Radharani as a devotee and he himself worships Krishna he himself serves Krishna he himself offers his love to Krishna. Okay.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The wonderful qualities in him that she alone relishes through her love."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the second internal reason: Krishna wants to understand the special qualities of Radharani that allow her to relish His wonderful qualities in a unique way.

So the first reason is desiring to understand the glory of Radharani's love. The second one is the wonderful qualities in him that she alone relishes through her love. Krishna is full of unlimited wonderful qualities. But who is able to relish those wonderful qualities the best devotees relish those qualities of course of Krishna. They are full of appreciation and they treasure that Krishna's wonderful qualities. And there is a verse in the Bhagavatam first canto with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explained in sixty one ways Atma Rama verse. What does that verse say? Atma Ramasya Munayo nirgranta api urukrame kurvanti ahetuteem bhakti ittham bhuta guno harihi Okay, this is a very big explanation is there. Ittham bhuta guno harihi Krishna is able to attract everybody in the whole creation, existence by his unlimited qualities. And because each jiva, each devotee has got something unique in their constitution. So if you are attracted by one particular quality of Krishna I will be attracted by some other quality of Krishna. Somebody else will be attracted by some other quality of Krishna. So there are no qualities which is lacking in Krishna which will attract every single jiva, every single devotee to Krishna. Therefore Krishna is the only one who is all attracted. Krishna is the only one who is all attracted. But in spite of Krishna having all the wonderful qualities by which he attracts everyone still he is wondering what are the special things about Radharani that she alone relishes through her love all those wonderful qualities in Krishna. So he wants to know that. So that is the second reason why he appears as taken in half with him. He takes the position of Radharani and tries to relish those qualities in him in Krishna which he has taken in half with him. He has taken the position of Radharani and tries to relish those qualities in him in Krishna with Radharani which Radharani otherwise alone relishes.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the explanation of the three internal reasons, focusing on Krishna's desire to experience the happiness Radharani feels when she realizes the sweetness of His love.

And the third one is the happiness she feels when she realizes the sweetness of his love. There is a happiness in all kinds of reciprocation of Krishna. When a devotee prays to Krishna for anything Krishna is very pleased to actually award that whatever the devotee asks of course provided you ask with devotion. Even otherwise if somebody doesn't ask with devotion still Krishna will award whatever anybody asks because he is situated as Paramatma in everyone's heart in the material world. And people don't have devotion in this material world. When they go to God or even go to a demigod or even perform some pious activities it's ultimately Krishna only who awards the result of somebody's pious activities or the result of worshipping demigods or the result of even doing Atheists doing hard work. Atheists doing whatever they do to get some fulfillment of desire including the Asuras. It is Krishna alone as Paramatma who satisfies all his desires. Okay. So Krishna actually satisfies everyone's desires and particularly he is very pleased to satisfy his devotees who never ask him anything who never ask him anything. So Krishna is looking for what does my devotee want what will satisfy him. The devotees don't ask pure devotees don't ask anything from Krishna. So what will Krishna do? Krishna is always looking for an opportunity to serve his devotees in any way he can. Just like devotees are always looking for opportunity to serve Krishna in all possible ways to please him. Same thing. So now Radharani she relishes delicious Okay. Now last last reason the happiness she feels when she realizes the sweetness of his love that is the third reason. Now Krishna says I'll complete this translation the Supreme Lord Hari richly endowed with her emotions appeared from the womb of Srimati and the Lord and the Lord of the world and the universe as I said in the book of Srimati and the universe and the universe in this
