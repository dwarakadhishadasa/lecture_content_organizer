**Key Quote:** "And water being transformed from all life on Earth appears knew in order and as previously becomes qualitatively full of juice, touch, sound and form respectively."
**Summary:** The speaker reads verses from Srimad Bhagavatam describing the transformation of elements in the process of creation.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 2, Chapter 5, Verse 26-29. I will read myself. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 2, Chapter 5, Verse 26-29. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "Because the star is transformed, the air is generated with the quality of touch. And by previous succession, the air is also full of sound and the basic principle of duration of life, sense perception, mental power, and bodily strength. When the air is transformed in course of time and nature's course, fire is generated, taking shape with the sense of touch and sound. Since fire is also transformed, there is a manifestation of water full of juice and taste. As previously, it also has form and touch and is also full of sound. And water being transformed from all life on Earth appears anew in order and as previously becomes qualitatively full of juice, touch, sound and form respectively."

**Key Quote:** "So in the same way Lord Brahma who is the director of this universe creator of the universe he is doing the set design"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a film director to explain how Lord Brahma creates the universe and assigns roles to living entities.

Suppose, let's say I'm a film director and I'm planning a film, and in that film I want some of you to become the king, some of you to become the queen, some of you to become warriors, some of you to become an invader, a villain who will come and do all nonsense, all wrong things, and some of you soldiers. And so now, in filmmaking, there is one important step after the script, casting, all that is done, that's called set design. Because it's a story of a king, queen, all this, we need a palace, we need a battleground, we need horses, we need elephants, we need soldiers. Next, as a film director, I'll start planning all of this so that when we turn on the lights and all of you can act out very correctly, the king will play his role, the queen will play her role, and then the invader will come and all the different things will, as per the story, will unfold. So in the same way, Lord Brahma, who is the director of this universe, creator of the universe, he is doing the set design.

**Key Quote:** "But a very fundamental deeper question is why have I become an actor in this drama but very rarely people think they are all busy with their roles they have to play mother father"
**Summary:** The speaker raises the fundamental question of why we are part of this worldly drama and emphasizes that people are usually too engrossed in their roles to contemplate the deeper meaning.

So a fundamental question is, why are we all part of this drama? But this is like a, this, okay, that's like a drama, cinema is all right, but this looks like real life. This doesn't look like drama. No, actually it is a fact. What is a drama, what is a cinema? After some time, the curtains will close and the lights are turned off and the drama ends. So even in our lives, one day the curtain will be drawn, the lights will be turned off, our drama will end, but it doesn't appear like that. It looks like real, you know, this is my wife, this is my husband, this is my home, this is my father, this is my mother, these are my children, this is my house. Why all of this has come about? These are deeper questions. One is, you are a king, play properly your role as a king. You, queen, play properly queen as a role as a queen, do your proper, be a strong king, all that is one thing. But a very fundamental, deeper question is, why have I become an actor in this drama? But very rarely people think, they are all busy with their roles, they have to play mother, father, husband, wife, and they want to play it out nicely so that everybody is impressed with the role I am playing. We rarely think why this drama is going on.

**Key Quote:** "We are the spirit soul we are playing the role of a man of a woman of an animal of a bird for some time and then the drama ends and then we will be an actor after he finishes one drama he'll get commissioned to do another drama so we will get another opportunity we will go to another situation"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that we are all spirit souls playing different roles in this material world, designed by Lord Brahma, and questions why the soul has become entrapped.

literatures, we get an understanding of this. We are all spirit souls. Just like in the drama or in the cinema, there is a set designer and makeup artist, costume designer. The costume designer will design for the king, you have to play the role of a king, so you should look like a king. You, she must look like a queen. All the costume design will happen. The palace is built. Brahma is doing all this. You should get a male body, you should get a female body, you should look like this, you should look like this, trees, plants. But inside this body is the spirit soul. We are the spirit soul. We are playing the role of a man, of a woman, of an animal, of a bird for some time and then the drama ends. And then we will be an actor, after he finishes one drama, he'll get commissioned to do another drama. So we will get another opportunity, we will go to another situation. Now the Vedic literatures provides a very, very significant perspective, why have we become part of this drama? What is this going on? And that is, we are all spirit souls, we take on this body and the body has male body, female body, animal body has designed by a by Lord Brahma, the creator of all this.

**Key Quote:** "And this Jeeva Shakti has developed a desire, I want to be independent of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that we are all part of Krishna, but unlike sunlight which cannot be independent of the sun, we have developed the desire to be independent.

Why has the soul become entrapped like this and playing this different role? Very nicely Prabhupada has written in the purport, previous purport. As an Amsha, we are all spirit soul, Amsha of Krishna. Just like there is sunlight. Sunlight has come into the room but some minutes back it was in the sun and it has come all the way and traveled here. Isn't it? We understand that. Now can the sun, sunshine, sunlight, is it possible for the sunlight to be independent of the sun? Can sunlight exist without the sun? Not possible at all, isn't it? Constitutionally, it is not possible. The sunlight is an emanation of the sun. In the same way, we are all living entities. We are all conscious entities coming from Krishna. We are all living entities. We are all conscious entities coming from Krishna. We are all living entities. We are all conscious entities coming from Krishna. We are all conscious entities coming from Krishna. But, this conscious entities have developed one desire. Sunshine has no desire. It is just light energy. Whereas, we are also energy, Jeeva Shakti of the Lord. And this Jeeva Shakti has developed a desire, I want to be independent of Krishna. I want to be independent of Krishna.

### illusion, unconstitutional desire, dream

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This desire of the living entity to be independent of Krishna is called unconstitutional desire."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unconstitutional desire to be independent of Krishna, comparing it to a dream where sunlight can exist without the sun, and how Krishna creates the illusion of the material world to facilitate this desire.

I want to be independent of Krishna. I want to be independent of Krishna. Krishna. Just like sunlight has come from sun, we are also Jeeva Shakti coming from Krishna, the Shaktimaan. But the difference is that is a inert, lifeless energy, light energy, heat energy. Whereas we are a Shakti which has got Chetana, consciousness. And this Chetana Shakti, Chit Shakti has developed a desire because it's Chetana. Chetana means has desire, has thinking, feeling. And this Chit Shakti has developed a desire, I must be independent of Krishna. It is not possible. Sunshine cannot be independent of the sun. It is an emanation of the sun. This desire of the living entity to be independent of Krishna is called unconstitutional desire. It is not constitutional. It is not by our makeup. How we are composed, how we are formed, what are we made of? We are made of Krishna's energy. We have come from Krishna. So we can never sever that. But we have developed a desire. I want to be independent of Krishna. This is possible only in illusion. For example, we can think of sunshine without sun in our dream. We can say last night I had a dream, you know, there was so much sunlight. I looked up at the sky and I didn't see the sun at all. But there was sunshine. Yes, such a thing is possible in illusory dream. Dream will go away. It's a temporary existence in the night. And when we wake up, it's all gone. Right? In the same way, Krishna through Brahma creates an illusion of this world for the living entities to give an impression that we are independent of Krishna.

### God consciousness, independent desires, blessings

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "But they follow religion, they follow Dharma. But they follow religion, they follow Dharma. With an aim that God will bless me so that all my various desires I have with my family, with my profession, with myself, I can fulfill all those desires with God's blessing."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how many people recognize God but primarily seek His blessings to fulfill their own independent desires and ambitions.

We are here in the material world. But among the living entities here, some of them have some God consciousness. So they recognize God, they go to temples, they worship, they follow some religion, some Dharma. But they follow religion, they follow Dharma. But they follow religion, they follow Dharma. With an aim that God will bless me so that all my various desires I have with my family, with my profession, with myself, I can fulfill all those desires with God's blessing. This is the large population of the society thinks like this. Recognize God. But I have my desires and I should fulfill my desires, my ambitions with God's blessing. But then the reality is that we are a spirit, chetana shakti, coming from Krishna. We rarely think, what is Krishna's plan for me? What does Krishna want me to do? I have come into this world, I am playing different roles. But our spirit of independence is such that I am here, I am independent, I have my independent desires and ambitions. And God is there, I want God's blessing to fulfill my independent desires. You see, I want to be independent is manifested in the spirit of I want to have independent desires.

### Krishna's plan, surrender, recognition of God
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/D1giBxi2ovc?t=1378
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Rarely we think, if I am part and parcel of Krishna, I have come from Krishna, what was Krishna's plan for me?"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts pursuing independent desires with aligning oneself with Krishna's plan, highlighting the initial stage of recognizing God as a fulfiller of personal dreams.

That's what we pursue. We have our plans. We get inputs from the society, from newspapers, from the heroes of the world, from different sources. And we form our ambitions and we have to do that. And we want to pursue. These are my desires, my ambition. Rarely we think, if I am part and parcel of Krishna, I have come from Krishna, what was Krishna's plan for me? This is the kind of an independent desire that we want to have. Because we want this desire, the independent desire, the independent existence, which is unconstitutional. Krishna creates an illusion in the material world. Gives us different roles and gives us an opportunity to play out our role, trying to be independent. That is the situation of the material world. That is what is happening here. So we take on different roles. I am man, I am woman, this is the family, this is my business. I must have a house, I must have big house. I must have big car, I must have big bank balance. And we work for all these things. Rarely we think, if we are all children of God, what does God want us to do? When we start thinking, what does God want? Can I know that? Can I align myself with God's intention? That is called Sharanagati. That is the next level of recognition of God. In the first stage, where we recognize God, I have my independent desires, I have my independent plans. I want God's blessing so that I can succeed in my own plan.

### Sharanagati, surrender, Krishna's plan
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/D1giBxi2ovc?t=1520
**Verse References:** BG 18.66
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "What does Krishna want me to do? If I am his."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of Sharanagati (surrender) and aligning one's desires with Krishna's plan, referencing the Bhagavad Gita's teaching on surrendering to Krishna.

This is also recognition of God, but a relatively very minimal recognition. God as a supplier of my dreams, as a fulfiller of my dreams. My dreams. It's my dream. And God shall kindly fulfill my dreams. See, this is the large population of the world, in every religion. This is the consciousness of the living entity. The next level Krishna teaches in the Bhagavad Gita, in the Vedic literatures, is that, if you are part and parcel of me, Krishna. We are all part and parcel of Krishna. We have come from Krishna. We are an energy of Krishna. What does Krishna want me to do? What is his plan for me? If I am his. If I am his. If I am his. So, this is how Bhagavad Gita ends, by bringing the concept of Sarva-Dharman-Paridhyajya. Ma mekam sharanam vraja. We must surrender to Krishna. We must align our desires, our plans, our activities, with Krishna's activity.

### relation with Krishna, drama relationships, temporary
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/D1giBxi2ovc?t=1625
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is a drama. It's only a drama relationship. No substance."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that after surrender, one understands their true relationship with Krishna, contrasting it with the temporary and insubstantial relationships in the material world.

And then what happens? Then, Bhagavatam describes further, after sharanagati, after you align, you will come to understand, you have a relation with Krishna. Relation. Relation is a very powerful thing. Just like somebody is a mother, there is a child. The mother is always conscious, I should take care of my child. And child also, playing around a little bit, if some difficulty, some danger comes, mummy, she will run to the mother, and hold on to the mother. That's the meaning of relationship. There is activity. There is feelings. So, now we, next the Vedic literatures inform us, we have a relation with Krishna. What about all these relationships in the material world? This is a drama. It's only a drama relationship. No substance. Just like in the dream also, we sometimes have so many relationships, so many activities. When we wake up in the morning, all the relationship, all the activities has no meaning. Say in the drama, I earn one crore rupees, and I put it safely into the bank. I am feeling very good. One crore rupees in the bank now. The alarm rings, and then I wake up. Will I run to the bank? Let me draw the one crore rupees. No. It's a dream. It has no substance. Same thing will happen to us, when our life's alarm rings, and we go out of this world. Where is all this relationship? Where is my house? Everything is gone.

### Ahamkara, false identity, true relation

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It all begins with ahamkara. Ahamkara means what? The living entity having a false identity."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of Ahamkara (false ego/identity) as the root of our entanglement, contrasting it with the true identity of being part and parcel of Krishna.

Reset to a new situation. So for all this, very nicely Bhagavatam brings out the primary principle is called Ahamkara. See that's how this Bhagavad, this verse began. So ahamkara iti prokto vikurvan samabhutritha. It all begins with ahamkara. Ahamkara means what? The living entity having a false identity. Usually in our normal language, ahamkara, don't have so much ahamkara. Somebody is very proud, very arrogant, we say that. Right? Yeah, that's okay. It's in one sense. The real sense of the word ahamkara, aham, my identity. My identity truly is I am a part and parcel of Krishna. But now I have developed a false identity. I am independent of Krishna. I have my own life. I have my own plans. I have my own ambitions. I have my own aspirations. And I want to fulfill all these things. And there is God. I understand. I am a pious person. I am a God fearing, God believing person. I need God's blessing to fulfill all my things, my ambitions. But these ambitions are independent of God's plan. I don't know. God is meant for, you know, for fulfilling my desires. That is God. This kind of a recognition of God to sharanagati, to God. And next, I have a relation with God. And that is a true relation. And all these relations are without substance. It's a temporary relation. And I must come to experience that relation which is substantial, which is true, which is real. And that experience and percept, understanding and experience of that relationship

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "And that experience and percept, understanding and experience of that relationship is called bhakti."
**Summary:** The speaker defines Bhakti as the understanding and experience of our true, intense, and loving relationship with Krishna.

is called bhakti. And that bhakti relationship can become intense. Just like relationships can be very intense between people sometimes. Sometimes, even grown-up men, they have very intense relation with their father and mother. We could have come across such people. Of course, between husband and wife, there could be an intense relation. Between children and parents, there is intense. We all have experienced that. When we had to leave our homes and join ISKCON, join temple, our heart was pulling, father, mother. It was very intense. You see? But these are, all these are drama relationships which we are thinking, it's so intense, it is this, that, all that. It's a drama. Not true. But the truth is that we have an intense, true relationship with Krishna. It is an intense, loving relationship with Krishna.

### material creation, false identity, independent desire

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The living entity has desire to be independent. Now Lord has to fulfill that. It is not possible to fulfill that. Because it is an unconstitutional desire."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Brahma creates the material world to fulfill the living entity's desire to be independent, even though it's an unconstitutional desire.

So, Bhagavatam is preparing us to understand all this and describing here how Brahma created all these sets in the form of the body, in the form of the dress for the body, in the form of the palace, in the form of the houses, and in modern world, in the form of my factory, my shop, my bank, my bank balance, my car. All these different things have come about. That's why, it is very nicely described here in this verse. Sohankara iti prokto vikurvan samabhut tridha. This ahankara, the false identity the living entity wants to take up. The living entity has desire to be independent. Now Lord has to fulfill that. It is not possible to fulfill that. Because it is an unconstitutional desire. It can only be fulfilled in a dreamlike situation. That is why, Srila Prabhupada gives another example of an unconstitutional desire. There was a child. Child, you know children, they become cranky sometimes. They cry, cry so much. They are small children. And the mother is trying to pacify the child, put the child to sleep. Not able to do anything. So when such things happen, you know, in homes, the mother brought the child, you know, sometimes due to heat also, the children go cranky. So she brought the child out of the house in the night. And hoping that, you know, cool, little cool breeze, child will become alright. The child was still very cranky. And now the child looked at the sky and there was the moon. And now the child started demanding, get me the moon. I want the moon. So the mother is very perplexed. What is this? How can I get the moon? Moon is in the sky. The child's desire is an unconstitutional desire. It is not possible for the child to get the moon from the sky. Impossible. It is not in line with the composition and what the child is made of, what the moon is made of.

**Key Quote:** "We are related to Krishna, we are meant to have a serving relationship with Krishna but we have developed a desire, I want to be independent, I want to enjoy, I have my plans, I want to have nice relationship in the material world without Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a child wanting the moon to illustrate how Krishna creates an illusory world to satisfy our unconstitutional desires for independence.

But the child has developed a desire. The father was an intelligent man. He was watching all this, how the wife, mother is struggling with the child and the child demanding the moon. The father, what he did, he went and brought one big mirror. He said, I want the moon. And the child saw the reflection of the moon in the mirror. And the child saw, oh, the moon is there. And the child was holding the mirror and the child became satisfied. Now I got the moon. Actually the child did not get the moon, got a reflection of the moon. We are related to Krishna, we are meant to have a serving relationship with Krishna but we have developed a desire, I want to be independent, I want to enjoy, I have my plans, I want to have nice relationship in the material world without Krishna. So Krishna has said, all right, I will create an illusory world with illusory forms, with illusory relationships, with illusory activities and we become busy here.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So that there is a sense of realism."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the truth from the Shastras and Acharyas, and how Brahma creates a sense of realism in the material world.

This is what is happening to us. Very few people know this truth from the Shastra. Our great Acharyas have presented this to make us understand. This is what is happening to us here. So this is the, how this, and for the, you know when you have to play the role of a king, someone has to play the role of a queen, somebody has an enemy, palace and finally why the cinema film, director is making all this so that the viewers will come and look, oh such a nice cinema it was. King he played his role where you look at the king, look at the palace he had, they should appreciate. So that there is a sense of realism. In the same way, Lord Brahma is creating this material world, minutely tweaking it to get a sense of realism for the audience. The sense of realism for us, the sense of rupa, forms, the sense of gandha, smell, the sense of taste, rasa, the sense of sparsha, soft, touch, the sense of sound, you see because

**Key Quote:** "Save and accept the Lord, no one can be called the enjoyer, but the living entity falsely desires to become the enjoyer. This is the origin of false ego."
**Summary:** The speaker reminds us that the material world is temporary and emphasizes that enlightenment comes from understanding the truth about the soul and its relationship with Krishna, highlighting false ego as the root of our problems.

of these things. Rasa, gandha, smell. Because of this we are having an experience. So Brahma is minutely designing and creating all these experiences so that it looks like a real world for us. Actually it's a, it's a temporary world. We have to remember this. This is endless. This is enlightenment. This is enlightenment, that this is the truth. What is true is this body is not truth, it will go away. The spirit soul, that is eternal. And that spirit soul has a relation with Krishna. So Srimad Bhagavatam is preparing us for all this understanding gradually. Gradually telling how the material creation is coming about. How the sets are being prepared for the actors to play the role in the same way how the material world is being created for the conditioned souls to come and play different roles in this material world. That's the sub, someone's substance. So there is one very nice statement by Srila Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada, in the previous purport, I'll read that, where is that, oh it's here. Factually, save and accept the Lord, no one can be called the enjoyer. Krishna alone is the enjoyer. Save and accept the Lord, save and accept the Lord, no one can be called the enjoyer, but the living entity falsely desires to become the enjoyer. This is the origin of false ego.

### confidential knowledge, master, enjoyer

**Verse References:** BG 9
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "I am the master, I am the enjoyer of everyone's activities and sacrifices."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the most confidential knowledge revealed by Krishna in the 9th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing that Krishna is the master and enjoyer of everything.

This is the origin of ahamkara. This is the important truth Krishna reveals in the 9th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. In the beginning of the chapter, 9th chapter, Krishna said, idam tu te guhyam pravakshyam anasuyave. Idam tu te guhyam pravakshyam anasuyave. Idam tu te guhyam pravakshyam anasuyave. I am going to tell you the most confidential knowledge. Pravakshyam anasuyave dhyana vigyana sahitam yajnatva mokshase ashubhata. And if you know this truth, you will be freed from all inauspiciousness. What is that truth? Most confidential truth Krishna has revealed in the 9th chapter. There are many aspects of the truth. One of them he is aham hi sarvayagnanam bhogtacha prabhurevaca. This is I am the master, I am the enjoyer of everyone's activities and sacrifices. Natumam abhijananti tatvenathas cavantite. One who don't accept this, I am the master and I am the enjoyer. This is the truth about me. This is the tattva. One who does not accept this. They come to this material world, in this world of illusion. This is the most difficult thing for people to accept. I am not the enjoyer, Krishna is the enjoyer. Or somebody may get an impression, oh Krishna is the enjoyer, I am not the enjoyer. That means Krishna is the enjoyer. And I am what? Sufferer is it? Because opposite of enjoyment is suffering, no? Krishna is the enjoyer. What about me? Krishna is the enjoyer, I am the sufferer. No. By serving him, we will get our enjoyment. That is our pleasure. Not independently trying to be the enjoyer. Krishna is the supreme. The supreme enjoyer. Bhokta cha prabhu revacha. He is the bhokta, he is the prabhu. We must accept. This is the most confidential knowledge that Krishna is describing.

### free will, love, independent desires

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For love to happen, freedom is required."
**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about free will, explaining that it is necessary for love to exist and that our turning away from Krishna leads to independent desires and entrapment in Maya.

When do we have a free will? And what percentage of free will we are having? Sorry. Why do we have a free will? And what is the percentage of free will we have? Okay, I will answer that. Okay, why do we have free will? See, we were just discussing that we have a relationship with Krishna. And that relationship is loving relationship, bhakti. For love to happen, freedom is required. Just like if I say, I show a gun at you and say, love me or else, you will get scared. I love you. Please let me go. There won't be true love. There is a saying, love cannot come from the barrel of a gun. So, for love, real love to exist, there has to be free will, freedom. So, Jeeva, we have come from Krishna. We are amsa of Krishna. Krishna is fully independent. Swarat. His position. We are amsa. We have small level of independence. We have free will to a small extent. Why Krishna has given that free will to us? Because he wants us to use the free will correctly and love him. But the option exists. If we don't want, we can turn away from him. That is what we are all doing. We have come into this world. Krishna bahirmukha. We have turned away from Krishna. We have come into this material world. Bhogavanchakare. Krishna bahirmukha. Bhogavanchakare. Nikatasta maya. Japati adhare. Very close. When we turn away from Krishna, the first symptom is, we develop independent desires. And moment we develop independent desires, Krishna creates an illusory world. And maya captures us to this world. That is what has happened to us.

**Key Quote:** "All living entities have have have free will. But that free will is most 100% manifest in human life."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing free will, explaining that it is most manifest in human life and that humans have the ability to understand the ultimate truth and escape the illusion of the material world.

Now, to what extent, what percentage, you said? Okay. All living entities have have have free will. But that free will is most 100% manifest in human life. And in human life, in sattvic life, it is 100% manifest. In rajasic life, may be little lesser. Tamasic life, even lesser. And animal life, even lesser. Plant life, the least. That's why you see plants, they just grow. They stand there. Practically, they have no volition. They don't have an ability. No, I want to be here. Animal, at least they can. No, I don't want to be in this room. I want to go there. They can run around. They are moving living entities. Birds can fly. There is a little bit more expression of freedom. And that expression of freedom is most in human beings. And if somebody is a little more enlightened and he has got a life, tranquil, peaceful life, he is more free. I can do many things. I can plan to do. You see, that's called sattva guna. So, you can see manifestation of free will according to the different forms, life forms. And it is most manifest in human body. And that's why human beings, we can understand all these ultimate truth and come out of this illusory world. Animals don't have that ability to come out of the illusion. They are just stuck in the illusion. We can come out of that illusion with proper knowledge from the shastra, from the acharyas. That is the possibility open to human beings. We will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna teaches that we must understand that there is a body and there is a spirit soul residing in the body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the fundamental concept of the spirit soul being distinct from the body, drawing from the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize the soul's eternal nature and the body's temporary existence.

But everyone should have a spiritual purpose because we must understand our composition in our present situation. This is the first teaching of the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna teaches that we must understand that there is a body and there is a spirit soul residing in the body. The spirit soul is distinct and different from the body. That is why one day this body can have a heart attack or some other kind of a big disease, and finally I will die. When I die, my body will be lying there. The body that everybody was relating with will be lying there. But then people will say, "Oh, he is gone." Who has gone? What has gone? The spirit has gone. So, there is a dual situation here. There is the body and there is the spirit soul. Because of the presence of the spirit soul, the body is animated. I can sing, I can speak, I can do work, I can think, I can solve problems. All this I can do because of the presence of the spirit soul. When the soul leaves the body, it's a dead body. It is just carried and set on fire into ashes. Nothing more can be done with it when the soul has left the body. But the soul, Krishna teaches, is eternal: na jayate namriyate vā kadācin na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of understanding and exploring our spiritual potential, contrasting it with our usual focus on bodily goals and relationships.

And so, we must realize that this body is just an external, temporary covering for the soul. And what happens is, we don't understand these things. We only have goals and purposes and aspirations connected with the body, and my things connected, relations with the body. So, spirituality is about understanding and exploring our spiritual potential, our spiritual aspect of life. And everyone is supposed to do this.

**Key Quote:** "We must have one track called spiritual development track."
**Summary:** The speaker suggests integrating spiritual development as one of the multiple tracks in our lives, alongside professional and personal pursuits, to cultivate a spiritual purpose.

And when you have spiritual purpose, one may think that what will happen to my profession? No. That can also go on. Profession can go on and our spiritual progress also can go on. We can run our lives on multiple tracks. All people do that. People run, they have their professional life, they have their personal life, and they have some hobbies, some music, something they'll be practicing, cultivating. They have that and another track. So, life runs on multiple tracks. And we must have one track called spiritual development track. And we may do many other things: our professional life, personal life. Along with this, we should fire another track in our lives called the spiritual understanding and spiritual development track. And in this way, we can bring in a spiritual purpose to our lives. Not just the professional purpose, personal purpose, and some hobbies and such things.

King Pariksit wondered how a person so attached to wife, children, and home could become so perfectly Krishna conscious. Prahalad Maharaj has said, Matirna Krishne Paratasvatova Mithobi Padhyeta Grihavrata Nam A Grihavrata, one who has taken a vow to execute family duties, has no chance to become Krishna conscious. This is because most Grihavratas are guided by sense gratification and therefore gradually glide down to the darkest regions of material existence. Adanta Ghovir Vishatam Tamisram. How can they possibly become perfect in Krishna consciousness? Maharaj Pariksit asked Shukadeva Goswami to resolve this great doubt.

So we are seeing in the first chapter of fifth canto questions asked by Pariksit to Shukadeva Goswami. He heard about Priyavrata becoming perfect in Krishna consciousness and so that has triggered a thought. And in today's verse he is saying, Samsa Yoham Mahan Brahman. This is my Mahan Samshaya. This is my great doubt. Brahman, O Brahmana, referring to Shukadeva Goswami, O great Shukadeva Goswami. Dara Gara Sutadishu Saktasya Yatsiddhirabhut. Dara, wife, Agara, home, Suta, children, Adishu. This is what happens in a human, in a Grahasta life. One becomes attached to wife, home, and children. Dara Gara Sutadishu Saktasya. One becomes attached. Asakti, sakta, one who has become attached. Yatsiddhirabhut. But you are also saying, Yet Siddhirabhut. But you are also saying, He achieved perfection. Siddhi. Perfection. And what kind of Siddhi? Krishnecha Mathirajyutha Mathihi, Prabhupada has here translated as became attachment. His mind, his consciousness became attached. Mathirajyutha. To Krishna. Krishnecha Mathirajyutha. To Krishna. Krishnecha Mathirajyutha. To Krishna. So this is very surprising that he became Krishne Mathihi. He became attached to Krishna. Became Krishna conscious. So the king continued, O great Brahmana, Brahman, This is my great doubt. Samsa Yoyam Mahan Brahman. How was it possible, For a person like King Priyavrata, Who was so attached, Saktasya, To wife, Dara, Children, Suta, And home, Agaara, To achieve the topmost infallible perfection, Achutasiddhihi. Infallible perfection. In Krishna consciousness, Krishnemathihi.

Some important points, Prabhupada has pointed out, In the translation, in the purport. So, Siddhihi. Perfection in life. Siddhirabhut. Perfection came about in his life. Priyavrata's life. And what was his life about? He was Dara, Agaara, Suta, Dishu, Saktasya. He was attached to wife, children, home, And all of that. He had a big family, Big palace. He was a king. All of that. And how he became perfect? So, First of all, we must appreciate that there is a, There should be a search for perfection in human life. And, That quest, Understanding, And attainment of that perfection, Should be the, Dominant aspect of human life. But of course, when we are not enlightened, When we have no spiritual knowledge, We don't know what is perfection. There are many people in the world, Trying to, Very, very passionately, Pursue some perfection in their life. Someone is trying to become a big politician. Someone is trying to become a big businessman. Someone may be trying to become a big scholar. Someone may be trying to become a famous person. So sometimes people have these conceptions, Or not sometimes, Most of the times. People have some conception like this. And they are very devoted to that perfection. I must achieve that. So, Quest for perfection is not a, Quest for perfection is not an unusual thing. In human society, Even in our Kali Yuga society, That quest for perfection is there.

**Key Quote:** "But then, where is he now? Where is that person?"
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the transience of material achievements like power and fame by referencing historical figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Napoleon, questioning their current relevance.

Because all of these perfections, Like becoming rich, becoming powerful, This world has seen many, many powerful people, Rich people, successful people, famous people. Prabhupada used to often mention, Wherever Gandhiji went, Because Prabhupada was a contemporary of Gandhiji. Of course, Gandhiji was a few decades older. But Prabhupada had seen, And Gandhiji was a very, very famous and very powerful person. And wherever he went, Wherever he went, People would be glorifying, Bapuji, Bapu, Bapu, Like that. And, Sometimes, Gandhiji would get so fed up, Of people screaming, He would close his ears. They are all screaming, shouting. He would close his ears. And we know that, When finally Gandhiji was assassinated, And then, His procession of his body was being taken, For the final rites in Delhi, New Delhi. You must have seen pictures. Thousands and thousands, And probably lakhs of people, Participating in that. So you can see how powerful he was. But then, Where is he now? Where is that person? Of course, In our country, Every city has, A road named after him. Right? But mostly, It has all become MG Road, And many people don't even know what MG Road is. Right? So this is what happens to, Powerful, Powerful people. Okay, Mahatma Gandhi is in a, In one sense, Quite recent memory, We may say. If you take hundreds of years before that, There were very powerful kings, Napoleon, They were also very powerful, In their own countries, In their own kingdoms. But what is their power now?

Nothing remains. Adyantavantakaunteya. It has a beginning, And it has an end. But interestingly, We are all attracted to these things. Power, Influence, Fame, Learning. It's a fact that these features attract us. Somehow, Inherently, We are attracted to that. If somebody is very powerful, Somebody is rich, Just like, If somebody's son is going to, Son or daughter is going to America, That family, They'll say, Neighbors, friends, My son is going to America. Right? Big thing. Suppose their son got a job in Africa, And he's going. Our son is going. It's not so attractive. You see, America is a, Attractive country. Powerful country. So we are attracted. And that's how Srila Prabhupada explains, The Shastras explain, Krishna has all these opulences to an unlimited extent. And hence, He becomes captivating. That absolute truth has all of these attractive qualities, By which one can be drawn. And hence, That absolute truth, Has the name, Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Just like we have to be devoted, to our partial cause, Father and mother, we should also be, Absolutely devoted, To our absolute cause, Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker draws an analogy between devotion to parents (partial cause) and devotion to Krishna (absolute cause), arguing that we should be absolutely devoted to Krishna as our ultimate source.

Because, We are all, Coming from the Absolute Truth. If somebody is attached to his father and mother, They will say it is a natural thing. If somebody is not at all attached, Then something, What is this? He is not caring for his father, Caring for his mother. They will say like that. Because, We have come from our father and mother, To love them, To show affection to them, And to serve them, Is considered the right thing. But then, Our father and mother, They are, Our source, Our cause, To a limited extent. Not to an unlimited extent. Not the complete cause, A partial cause. So, If we, This is a philosophical aspect, We have to, We have to reflect on it. Yes, What caused me? My father and mother caused me. Now what caused my father and mother? My grandfather, And grandmother, They caused my father, My mother. So in other words, They are, My father and mother were, It's a chain of causes and effects, And they were one cause, One level of cause. And even in that, They were a partial cause. We cannot attribute everything to them, Philosophically speaking. Not that we are minimizing father and mother, But philosophically we are analyzing. Like say for instance, There is a child who was, Who was born blind. If you say father and mother, Are the cause of the child, We must blame that father and mother. Why did you give birth to a blind child? You couldn't do something properly, Child is nicely born. They'll say, What to do? It was not in our control. It was not in your control. That's exactly we are saying. They are partial cause, They are not the ultimate cause. So, Absolute truth, Is the ultimate cause, Of everything, Including us. So just like we have to be devoted, To our partial cause, Father and mother, We should also be, Absolutely devoted, To our absolute cause,

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "As spiritualists, we do not trust our mind."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of controlling the mind and not surrendering to its dictations, highlighting the need for introspection and understanding the forces within the body.

Prabhupada explains that a spiritualist has to be very sober, introspective, thoughtful, grave: vacho vegam, manasa, krodha vegam, jihva vegam, udhara upastha vegam. It means a kind of a force in the body. Prabhupada gives the example, just like our body is designed in such a way, when there is a nature's call, it creates a force, irresistible force. We all have to rush to the washroom. In the same way, there are other forces in this body, and one of them is the force of the mind. As spiritualists, we must know these workings of the mind, workings of the forces in this body, so that we know how to deal with them. Shukadev Goswami is giving one such example. He is saying, "This mind, which is unsteady and which comes with a force, don't trust this mind." This is the first instruction. So, Prabhupada explains, as spiritualists, we do not trust our mind, meaning we do not surrender to the dictations of our mind. The mind comes with a force. Mind comes with an idea: "Let's do this. Let's do that. You do this. You do that." And it comes with a certain force. Don't trust your mind. This is the instruction. Watch the mind's action. So, in other words, this is the instruction. In other words, intelligence is higher than the mind. Soul is higher than the intelligence.

**Key Quote:** "We first become devotees of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the paradox of becoming proud of pridelessness and emphasizes that genuine spiritual qualities arise from devotion to Krishna rather than mental attempts to acquire them.

Some time back, one devotee asked me, what if a devotee becomes proud of pridelessness? Yes, it happens. It can happen. We can become proud of many other virtues that a devotee is supposed to have. But, our method of developing all these qualities is not by trying to acquire those qualities separately. We first become devotees of Krishna. To become genuine devotees of Krishna, we have to come to a spiritual platform. Our principle is, in such a person's heart, all divine qualities will come about. If we make an attempt to become prideless on a mental plane, there is a chance that we will become proud of pridelessness. But our attempt is to come to a spiritual platform. And when one comes to a genuine, spiritual platform,

Not having a proper residence and carrying his suitcase and at early in the morning at 7 a.m. Moving around and in the house of somebody who's not very comfortable to have him. Going through all these kind of situations.

**Summary:** Prabhupada insists on the name 'Krishna Consciousness' over 'God Consciousness,' explaining that the society will make Krishna known worldwide and that the term was inspired by Rupa Goswami.

Maybe you should call it International Society for God Consciousness because nobody knows Krishna in America. So Swamiji says no God Consciousness is a very vague term and this should be known as Krishna Consciousness and this society will make Krishna known all over the world. If people don't know who is Krishna the society will make Krishna known all over the world. That was the kind of reasoning that Prabhupada had that God Consciousness is a very vague word and he used the word Krishna Consciousness and in fact, the word Krishna Consciousness was also coined by Shrila Prabhupada, which later on he would say that he drew that on the basis of one expression that Rupa Goswami had used in one of his works. Krishna Bhakti Rasa Bhavita Matihi. Matihi means consciousness consciousness. Bhavita means imbued with and consciousness, which is imbued with Krishna Bhakti Rasa. So that's how Prabhupada had coined that word Krishna Consciousness and he wanted this to be a society of Krishna Consciousness for devotees to come together, who are practicing and as per the vision of his spiritual instruction of the spiritual master and as per the prophecy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. This has to be an international society. And that's how the name International Society for Krishna Consciousness came up.

### devotional service, impediments, Vaishnava Aparadha, Krishna consciousness
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/i5ImCRHRxU8?t=126
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna consciousness is perfect and eternal, and therefore it cannot be lost under any circumstances."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the impediments to devotional service, including Vaishnava Aparadha and the Lord's desire, emphasizing that a devotee advanced in Krishna consciousness cannot be lost.

who has once absorbed his mind in the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may sometimes be influenced by impediments, but he still does not give up his exalted devotional position. According to Srila Vishwanath Chakravarthy Thakura, there are two kinds of impediments to devotional service. The first is an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaishnava. This is called Vaishnava Aparadha. Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu warned His devotees not to commit Vaishnava Aparadha, which He described as the mad elephant offense. When a mad elephant enters a beautiful garden, it destroys everything, leaving a barren field. Similarly, the power of Vaishnava Aparadha is so great that even an advanced devotee becomes almost devoid of his spiritual assets if he commits it. Since Krishna consciousness is eternal, it cannot be destroyed altogether, but advancement may be checked for the time being. Thus, Vaishnava Aparadha is one kind of impediment to devotional service. Sometimes, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee desires to impede one's devotional service. For example, Hiranyakashyapu and Hiranyakshya were formerly Jaya and Vijaya, the gatekeepers in Vaikuntha, but by the desire of the Lord, they became His enemies for three lives. Thus, the desire of the Lord is another kind of impediment. But in both cases, the pure devotee once advanced in Krishna consciousness cannot be lost. Following the orders of his superiors, Swayambhuva and Lord Brahma, Priyavrata accepted family life, but this did not mean he lost his position in devotional service. Krishna consciousness is perfect and eternal, and therefore it cannot be lost under any circumstances. Because the material world is full of obstructions to advancement in Krishna consciousness, there may appear to be many impediments, yet Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, declares in Bhagavad Gita, 9.31 Once one has taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost. In this verse, the word Shivatamam is very significant. Shivatamam means the most auspicious. The devotional path is so auspicious that a devotee cannot be lost under any circumstances. This is described in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita by the Lord Himself. Parthnaivehanamutra Vinashastasya Vidyavrata My dear Arjuna, for a devotee, there is no question of being lost, either in this life or in the next. In Bhagavad Gita, 6.43, the Lord clearly explains how this is so. Tatratam buddhi samyogam labhate pavarvadehikam yadate chatato bhuyaha samsiddho kuru nandana By the order of the Lord, a perfect devotee sometimes comes to this material world like an ordinary human being. Because of his previous practice, such a perfect devotee naturally becomes a devotee. He becomes attached to devotional service, apparently without cause. Despite all kinds of impediments due to surrounding circumstances, he automatically perseveres in devotional service and gradually advances until he once again becomes perfect. Below Mangal Thakura had been an advanced devotee in his previous life, but in his next life he became greatly fallen and was attached to a prostitute. Suddenly, however, his entire behavior was changed by the words of the very prostitute, who had so much attracted him, and he became a great devotee. In the lives of exalted devotees, there are many such instances, proving that once one has taken to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost. Kaunteya pratijanihi namey bhaktav pranashyati The fact is, however, that one becomes a devotee when he is completely freed from all reactions to sinful life. As Krishna states in Bhagavad Gita, 7.28, Esham tuantagatam paapam jananam punyakam te dvandhva moha nirmukta bhajan teman dhrdha vrataah Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of illusion, engage themselves in my service with determination. On the other hand, as Prahlad Maharaj said, Matirna krishne paratas svatova mito bhipadyeta grihavrataana A person who is too attached to materialistic things, family life, home, family, wife, children and so on, cannot develop Krishna consciousness. These apparent contradictions are resolved in the life of a devotee by the grace of the Supreme Lord and therefore a devotee is never bereft of his position on the path of liberation which is described in this verse as Shiva tamam padavim Dasan dhristavak chidantaprabhat So in this chapter of the Srimad Bhagavatam entitled The Activities of Maharaj Priyavrata we just saw Parikshit Maharaj asking different questions about Priyavrata's life how he was a great devotee renounced from all material activities but then he took up he became a grihasta, became a householder had two wives had many children and apparently became attached to family members and he was a ruler, he was a king dealing with all the complications of a king's life how did this happen? because if somebody is attached to family life and such materialistic things he cannot develop Krishna consciousness and if one has become advanced in Krishna consciousness he will not become attached to material things so this looks like Priyavrata's life seems to be a contradiction so that was the question that Parikshit Maharaj has raised and this entire chapter is going to resolve this apparent contradiction and today's verse Shukadev Goswami has begun he is saying bhaada muktam yes what you have said this is what you have said is correct muktam what you have said Parikshit just now bhaadham it is true and then Shukadev Goswami is further elaborating bhagavata utthama shlokasya srimaccharanaravindamakarandharasaaveshita chetasah bhagavata paramahamsadaitakatham it is all describing the position of a devotee bhagavata utthama shlokasya the lord bhagavata bhagavan the lord utthama shlokasya who is glorified by transcendental and eloquent prayers srimaccharanaravinda his lotus feet makharandha the honey or the sweet nectar rasa that is the sweet nectar rasa aveshita chetasaha once whose heart is aveshita absorbed by in the in remembering the lotus feet of the lord which is makharandha rasa bhagavata utparamahamsa and such devotees who are paramahamsas they are liberated daita katham and the lord's activities katham descriptions are daita very very pleasing to them so they are attached to the lotus feet of the lord they are absorbed in hearing the glorification hearing the glories of the lord such devotees kinchit sometimes what happens to them antaraya vihatam sometimes they may be checked by some impediments antaraya vihatam they may be checked by antaraya impediments some obstacles however swam shivatamam padaveem but that padaveem that position shivatamam padaveem that most auspicious position they have attained their own position swam shivatamam padaveem naprayena naprayena hinvanti nahinvanti they never lose that position they never give up that position prayena more or less in that sense almost naprayena hinvanti

**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of 'Shivatamam' as most auspicious and how devotional service is the most auspicious position, which is never lost even with impediments.

shishukadeva goswami said what you have said is correct badhamuktam the glories of the supreme personality of godhead who is praised in eloquent transcendental verses bhagavata uttama shlokasya srimad charanaravinda by such eloquent transcendental verses by such exalted personalities as brahma are very pleasing to great devotees daitha and liberated persons paramahamsa great devotees and liberated persons is very pleasing one who is attached to the nectarian honey makarandarasa of the lord's lotus feet shrimad charanaravinda and whose mind chetasa is always absorbed aveshita in his glories katham may sometimes kinchit be checked by some impediments vihatam antaraya vihatam but he still never gives up na hinvanti the exalted position he has acquired shivatamam padavim na hinvanti auratam na hinvanti this is the message of shukadev Goswami shukadev Goswami and Shila Prabhupad has explained some very interesting things so here the expression used Prabhupada has pointed out in the purport shivatamam padavim shivatamam शिवा means auspicious and शिवतमाम means just like गुह्यम, गुह्यतारा, गुह्यतमाम, it is superlative. In the same way, शिवतमाम means most auspicious. So, the living entity may come across, may have some things which are auspicious. Living entities may come across something more auspicious. And living entities may come across something most auspicious. And devotional service to Krishna. This position, आवेशित, मकरंदरस, आवेशित, चेतसहा, is the most auspicious. This is the most auspicious position of a devotee. And that position is never lost, even if a devotee has to encounter certain impediments.

**Key Quote:** "One may lose his devotional service, but one will not lose it completely, because devotional service is eternal."
**Summary:** This segment discusses two kinds of impediments: Vaishnava Aparadha and the Lord's desire, using the example of Jaya and Vijaya to illustrate how the Lord may impede devotional service for extraordinary reasons.

And then Prabhupada has quoted in the purport, Vishwana Chakravarti Thakur's explanation, Yes, this अन्तराय विहताम, there can be two kinds of impediments. One impediment, the first impediment is वैश्णवा पराथ. If someone commits वैश्णवा पराथ, that's an impediment. But, प्रभुपाद has clarified, even if it is an impediment, one may lose his devotional service, but one will not lose it completely, because devotional service is eternal. consciousness is eternal it cannot be destroyed all together but Advancement may be checked for the time being till the devotee corrects him his Vaishnav Aparath sets it right it may be checked so Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's warning is that one has to be very careful about Vaishnav Aparath so that's one kind of impediment then there is another kind of impediment the other kind is Lord or his devotees own wishes sometimes however the Supreme Personality of Godhead or his devotee desires to impede one's devotional service for some very extraordinary reasons devotee Lord himself wants to impede Lord's devotee wants to impede that must be under some very extraordinary circumstance what was the example Prabhupada has quoted Jaya and Vijaya they were the gatekeepers of Vaikuntha they were serving the Lord personally they had great personal Association of the Lord but then they were sent to take birth three lives and become asuras so that is another interesting pastime of the Lord and why did that happen Why did Lord decide impede their devotional service Lord had it why did the Lord desire like that and Jaya and Vijaya go there and the whole arrangement happened the four kumaras came and they were not

**Key Quote:** "The absolute truth is a personality. And what is the meaning of personality? Personality means somebody who has got desires."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the Lord is a personality with desires for enjoyment, which are variegated and multi-dimensional, and that He sometimes arranges for devotees to take on different roles to provide Him with different kinds of pleasure.

Actually, a conscious person, a very primary characteristic of a conscious person, personality is having desires for enjoyment. That's why ultimately Kama Deva means Krishna. Because Kama, desire to enjoy, ultimately belongs to the Lord. He is the ultimate Kama Deva. So He is the Supreme Personality, means He has desires to enjoy. And enjoyment is not one-sided, it is variegated, it is multi-dimensional. And so, Lord, sometimes everyone is praising me. Okay, let me, somebody should also fight with me. That's another nice thing. So the Lord may decide, okay, my dear two devotees, I will impede your devotional service here. You can do another kind of devotional service by going there and taking birth as Asuras. And I will come and fight. And you should be strong. Don't worry. It is a tough fight. Otherwise, what is the use? I come and fight and then suddenly you surrender. It doesn't please me. So I want you to become powerful demons. Shake the whole universe. Then I will come. Then we will have fight. You see how this is? This is actually, Bhagavatam is establishing the personality. The absolute truth is a personality. And what is the meaning of personality? Personality means somebody who has got desires. And he pursues those desires for enjoyment. And the pursuit of the desire for enjoyment constitutes activities. That is actually the Lord and His associates. That's actually the truth.

**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of a prisoner's perspective to explain how our understanding of the spiritual world is limited by our material existence, emphasizing that the spiritual world is the greater and dominant reality.

What happens is, our view of the world and the creation, it is just like the prisoner's view in a prison in our world. The prisoner is in the prison. He is used to things in the prison. Big walls. He is conditioned. He cannot escape. He cannot relate with the family members. It's all restricted. He wants to enjoy. It's all restricted. So this is actually the perspective of a prisoner. In the same way, our perspective is actually we see from the material world. Actually the truth is, we all know, we all are outside the prison in this world. So we know that how the world is full of irrigatedness. So many activities. There are parks. There are malls. There are restaurants. So many ways to enjoy. By the way, there is one small portion in our city, in every city, called the prison. In the same way, the reality is, the greater reality is, the Lord and His associates and the wonderful pastimes that happen in the spiritual domain. By the way, there is one part of the creation called the material world where all the rebellious living entities are put there. So, this is actually the reality. But, because we are in the material world, we are trying to understand the spiritual reality from the material domain. It's just like the prisoners looking at, oh, there is something called a free world, is it? Oh, there is some park. There are parks there. There are all such beautiful things. Okay, maybe there. So, that's the view of an inmate of a prison. Actually, that's the way we look at when we hear about the spiritual world. But, the greater reality and the dominant reality is the spiritual world.

### Lord's desires, devotee's roles, superior's orders, spiritual position

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One will not lose his devotional position if one is under the order of superiors one is acting in this way."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the Lord's desires and the orders of superiors can lead devotees to take on different roles, using the examples of Jaya and Vijaya and Priyavrata, emphasizing that following the orders of superiors ensures one does not lose their spiritual position.

The material world is a small portion. So, so this is the, so these are the reasons why certain times the Lord wants, Lord is a personality and He has got desires and He wants to pursue those desires for His pleasure and His own devotees take up different roles to give Him different varieties of pleasure and that is another example. So, this is an example Prabhupada has quoted of Jaya and Vijaya where their devotional service was in one sense impeded but actually not in another sense. It was meant for a larger, another kind of a pleasure of the Lord. So, sometimes we may see this kind of an impediment. Another one is Priyavrata himself. Priyavrata was not, his impediment came not from the Lord but from his devotee. Swayambhuva Manu and Brahma, both great personalities, great devotees, they went and told Priyavrata who was in his, like it is described here, Makaranda Rasa, Aveshita Cheta Saha, he was absorbed in transcendental mellows of the Lord but they went and told him, no, no, now you come, become a king, become a householder, have queens, have children, all of that. So, he may do that but Priyavrata when he is doing that, he never lost his shivatamam padaveena prayena hinvanti. They never lose their spiritual position. That is to be appreciated and understood because Krishna consciousness is perfect and it is eternal and it cannot be lost under any circumstance. So here, important point is following the orders of his superiors Swayambhuva Manu and Lord Brahma, Priyavrata accepted family life but this did not mean he lost his position in devotional service. This is the point that this chapter is going to point out. Bhakti is such that if one is in different kinds of roles, if one is in different kinds of situations, but those roles and situations are under the order of the superiors, then one will not lose his devotional position. This is the crux of the matter. shivatamam padaveena prayena hinvanti One will not lose his devotional position if one is under the order of superiors one is acting in this way.

**Summary:** This segment highlights Srila Prabhupada's life as an exemplary demonstration of spiritual principles, particularly following the orders of his spiritual master.

And this principle and many other principles of the Bhagavatam they were actually demonstrated in the life of Srila Prabhupada. I heard somewhere one devotee describing actually Prabhupada's life is so exemplary. It's not unlikely Vyasadeva will include Prabhupada's life in some part of the Bhagavatam which he composes in some other part of the universe. Because lives of devotees demonstrate spiritual principles and Prabhupada's life is a great demonstration of one of the important principles which is to follow the orders of the superior. Prabhupada's life was fully a manifestation of the following the order of his spiritual master.

**Summary:** This segment shares excerpts from Srila Prabhupada's lectures and letters, emphasizing that his motivation for traveling and spreading Krishna consciousness was solely to fulfill the order of his spiritual master, not for personal gain or recognition.

There was once a lecture Prabhupada gave somewhere in Canada. I'll read some portions of that. Prabhupada is speaking in Montreal 1969. In this old age I have come to your country. Why? Because we are trying to follow the footprints of Lord Chaitanya. Therefore we have come. Otherwise in old age who goes out of home? You see like we sometimes hear about our some spiritual gurus and Swami's spiritual God men in our country. They go open centers around the world and they have temples they have followers. Why do they go? Mostly it is that you know I want to expand my footprint by just India. I have a global footprint. Because you know these are all ideas from the from the world of business. And where they want to expand businesses around the world such ideas are there. Or maybe there are rich disciples there I can get rich disciples and so I can become very prosperous. Whereas when Srila Prabhupada was going what was his motivation? What was the what was actually driving him? It was not some kind of some kind of a global footprint and rich disciple. None of those things. Because my spiritual master ordered I have come I have gone to different parts of the world. In another letter Prabhupada wrote I have come to your country to carry out the wishes of my spiritual master and you are kindly cooperating with me.

**Summary:** This segment continues to illustrate Srila Prabhupada's humility through his letters, where he emphasizes that he is merely abiding by the order of his spiritual master and that all credit goes to him.

So Prabhupada was going to different places and we have Krishna Consciousness our attempts to expand Krishna Consciousness to different parts of the world it is because it was the wish of our predecessor Acharyas. In another letter that Prabhupada wrote to Brahmananda very very interesting letter. We can see the humility of Srila Prabhupada. Personally I am non entity. Prabhupada is saying I am nothing. Personally I am non entity. I have come here on the order of my spiritual master and he has kindly sent you all boys to assist me. So whatever is being done there is no credit for me. But all the credit goes to my spiritual master because he has arranged everything and I am simply to abide by his order. Just see this the mood of Srila Prabhupada. I am simply to abide by his order.

So this is actually the the life of Srila Prabhupada. All his struggles were to follow the order of his superior. And that is a that is a life that should be the life of a devotee. A devotee is not independent. What we do how we do what we like to do all those things we set aside we do what our superiors wanted us to do. This is the kind of a consciousness that a devotee we see how Srila Prabhupada is demonstrating that. Actually the words in the Upanishad yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau or acharya maam vijaniyan these are statements in the Vedic literatures yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau as you must have para bhakti to Lord you must have similar para bhakti to your Guru this is the instruction of the Upanishad

hence for those of us who are here in the material world like in the prison we are cut off from the prisoners are cut off from the free world in the same way we are cut off from the spiritual world we cannot get there in our present situation in our present consciousness we don't know about that spiritual world sometimes an important officer of the government comes to the prison and then he tells them what is the world outside like why are you all suffering here he brings information about the free world such a person is very special isn't it and he tells them if you do these things you can come there you don't have to be suffering like this here you come there there is real enjoyment there is real relationships are there relationships are not excluded in the material world relationships are temporary and it will not always give us happiness in the spiritual world there is a world of relationships between the devotees and the Lord and various other devotees once Prabhupada was asked what will happen to all of us when we go Prabhupada said in the spiritual world there will be another is gone and all of us will associate there so we will be with Prabhupada so this is the reality that Prabhupada was sharing see how when we are in the material world we don't know what it is and so an Acharya comes and his words have to be regarded very very specially and Prabhupada's own life is a demonstration of how he regarded his spiritual master's words so seriously another expression Prabhupada used we should take the words of the spiritual master as one's life and soul and Prabhupada's life is actually a demonstration of these things

in fact Prabhupada recalls another in connection with Bilwa Mangal Thakur I will read this small paragraph this was a class Prabhupada gave in Gorakhpur in 1971 my Guru Maharaj used to say like that finish this business in this life don't delay for the next life you see this kind of an intensity the kind of a seriousness that Srila Bhaktisiddhant Saraswati Thakur brought in his instructions carried down by Srila Prabhupada actually this is the mood of the Bhagavatam this is the mood of the Vedic literatures don't take it in a in a cool relaxed manner okay if I if possible let me make some spiritual advantage if it doesn't happen it's okay life is you know no Thivrena Bhakti Yogena a certain kind of a Thivra Thivra means intense it is expected the Bhagavatam's teachings are to bring that Thivra so that's why Bhaktisiddhant Saraswati Thakur is saying finish this business this business means Prabhupada explained in an earlier part of this lecture this business of lording over material nature like we are all interested to do lord over material nature and enjoy different things material pleasures finish this business lording business in this life don't delay for the next life he was telling also don't give me trouble again to come to deliver you don't give me trouble to don't give me trouble again to come here to deliver you that is the responsibility of the spiritual master spiritual master's responsibility is to take the disciple to Krishna until he is able to to help him to help him to help him that is the verdict of the Shastras just like Bilwa Mangal Thakur his spiritual master delivered him taking the shape of a prostitute just see so this is the position of the spiritual master it is his responsibility to take and see the way Prabhupada is saying until he is able to to help him to help him to help him and to help him if he has become so fallen hunting prostitutes come as a prostitute and help him these are very very transcendental dynamics that happens how the lord his and his devotees make arrangements to uplift a living entity take him back to the spiritual world so these are some very extraordinary things

**Key Quote:** "I am not revealed to everyone. There is a curtain of Yogamaya that is covering me."
**Summary:** Discussion of how Krishna is not revealed to everyone due to Yogamaya and the living entities' desire for independence from the Lord.

Contradictory. How can the festival which is joyous be a punishment? How can punishment which is miserable be a festival? So we will see all of that in a short while. Also, this festival conveys a very profound spiritual message. Krishna says, नाहं प्रकाश सर्वस्या योगमाय समावृतः, "I am not revealed to everyone. There is a curtain of Yogamaya that is covering me." So Krishna, who is the supreme personality of God, who is the Param Sathya, who is the Param Tattva, and in this material world, all the living entities are in a spirit of independence from the Lord, don't want to surrender to the Lord, want to lead a life independent of the Lord. To them, the Lord is not revealed easily.

**Summary:** Explanation of how Balaram, as the Prakasha Tattva, reveals Krishna, and how the guru is a representation of Balaram, giving Krishna to the forgetful living entities; Balaram is Nithyananda Prabhu.

So the living entities who are here in the material world, who have turned away from Krishna, how will they ever be rectified from their illusory, imagined position of being independent of the Lord? So Lord has one immediate expansion tattva called prakasha tattva. The Lord's prakasha tattva's function is to prakasha, to make, to illuminate, to reveal the truth to the living entities, to the living entities who are in ignorance. We are in such an ignorance, just like the sunshine thinking, "I will be independent of the sun," most ridiculous, most impossible. That is our situation. To such ignorant living entities, to bring prakasha, to illuminate them, there is an expansion of the Lord, and that expansion of the Lord is Balaram. So Krishna is the original person, and Balaram is his immediate expansion, and he is prakasha tattva. Krishna is para tattva or bhagavat tattva, non-different. Krishna and Balaram, Krishna and Balaram, both are on the same spiritual absolute position, but Balaram is the one who reveals Krishna, and one who reveals to the living entities about all this is guru, and that guru is actually a representation of Balaram prakasha tattva. This is the understanding. The guru is someone who reveals Krishna. Guru is someone who gives Krishna to the forgetful living entities. So when Krishna came as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Balaram, the prakasha tattva of the Lord, came as

He was longing to be with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to serve his mission, be in his association.

Chaitanya Charitamruta says he mixed bananas and honey to all of this and served Nithyananda Prabhu and all the associates on the banks of Ganga. And at that time, Nithyananda Prabhu made a statement, "We belong to the cowherd clan, and coming on a picnic like this on the bank of a river and having delicious food to eat is something that we love." Actually, this statement is significant because Nithyananda Prabhu is Balarama, and Krishna and Balarama and the cowherd boys would go on the banks of Yamuna and they would have their picnic everyday. All the things that their mothers had brought, had sent with them, they would share, called Vanabhoj. So that's what Nithyananda Prabhu was reminiscing. And at that time, Nithyananda Prabhu by his meditation brought Chaitanya Mahaprabhu there, and only a few fortunate souls, it is said, could see Chaitanya and Nithyananda, and there was ecstatic uproarious kirtan with Chaitanya and Nithyananda and chanting of the holy names which filled the air, and this Chiradahi which was given to Nithyananda and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was served to everyone. So this was a festival, and then towards the end of the festival, mystically Chaitanya Mahaprabhu vanished from the scene and only Nithyananda Prabhu and other associates were there.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "So, being a devotee in a transcendental relationship and not being envious of Krishna, these are the qualifications one must have in order to access the confidential knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita."
**Summary:** HG Chanchalapathi Dasa explains that devotion and lack of envy towards Krishna are essential qualifications for understanding the confidential knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita, based on Krishna's statements to Arjuna.

In the fourth chapter, Krishna says, "Bhaktosime Sakacheti Rahasyam Hetaduttamam Arjuna, this is a confidential knowledge, but you can understand because you are my devotee and friend." So, devotion to Krishna in a transcendental relationship, like a friendship relationship, is an important qualification to access that confidential knowledge. Later on, in the ninth chapter, Krishna says, "Idam Tute Guhyatamam Pravakshyamyana Suyave." There also he says, this is very confidential knowledge, but Arjuna, you can understand because you are not envious of me. So, being a devotee in a transcendental relationship and not being envious of Krishna, these are the qualifications one must have.

**Key Quote:** "Because he is absolute, both his anger and pleasure are the same."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while both Arjuna and Krishna are described as angry, Krishna's anger is transcendental and not subject to material nature.

Both Arjuna and Lord Shri Krishna are described here in an angry mood. But Arjuna's eyes were like balls of red copper, whereas the eyes of the Lord were like lotuses. This means that the angry mood of Arjuna and that of the Lord are not on the same level. The Lord is Transcendence. Please note, Transcendence with a capital T. And thus he is absolute in any stage. His anger is not like the anger of a conditioned living being within the modes of qualitative material nature. Because he is absolute, both his anger and pleasure are the same. His anger is not exhibited in the three modes of material nature. It is only a sign of his bent of mind towards the cause of his devotee. Because that is his transcendental nature. Therefore, even if he is angry, the object of anger is blessed. He is unchanged in all circumstances.

### Ashwatthama, Arjuna's anger, Krishna's anger, Srila Prabhupada's purport

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada is taking this as an opportunity to explain that Arjuna's anger was that his eyes were red. Krishna is also angry that his eyes are like lotus."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the context of Ashwatthama's capture and how Srila Prabhupada uses the situation to explain the difference between Arjuna's and Krishna's anger.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport. It's a very interesting part of the Bhagavatam. Ashwatthama has been captured by Arjuna. He is Rajva Bhadva. He is being tightly bound by the ropes. Ripum, he is his enemy. Shibiraya Nishantam. And it is Arjuna's intent that he should bring him to the Shibira military camp. Praha, at that time, spoke. Krishna spoke. Praha, Arjuna. And to Arjuna, Prakupitaha. Praha, who is angry. Bhagavan, Ambujekshanaha, Lord, who has lotus eyes, spoke. Praha, because in the next verse we see Lord Krishna speaking. So Bhagavan, Ambujekshanaha, Krishna, who has lotus eyes, spoke. Prakupitaha, to angry Arjuna. And in the purport, Srila Prabhupada has expanded the understanding and he has said that not only Arjuna was angry, even Krishna was angry about the whole thing. If you see the next statement of Krishna, which you will see in your next class, he is telling Arjuna, kill him. Obviously, you can't be telling Krishna to kill him in a very happy way. Kill him. So there is anger even in Krishna's voice. So even Krishna is angry. Arjuna is also angry. Kill him. So that's the kind of... It's not a simple, normal conversation that's going on. So it's full of anger. And so, in the purport, we see how Srila Prabhupada is taking action. Srila Prabhupada is taking this as an opportunity to explain that Arjuna's anger was that his eyes were red. Krishna is also angry that his eyes are like lotus.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's position, Krishna's personality, Krishna's form, Krishna's nature, Krishna's name, Krishna's activities, all of these are transcendental."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the transcendental nature of Krishna, contrasting it with the material world composed of Panchabhootas (five elements) and influenced by Kala (time).

That is the difference. Srila Prabhupada takes every opportunity to explain the position of Krishna as a transcendental person. Krishna's position, Krishna's personality, Krishna's form, Krishna's nature, Krishna's name, Krishna's activities, all of these are transcendental. Transcendental meaning, it is something not of this material domain. In the material domain we are familiar with Panchabhootas, right, earth, water, fire, all our bodies, table, all of this is actually transformation of the Panchabhootas. And the Panchabhootas are always undergoing transformation, that is the nature of the Panchabhootas, and they are undergoing transformation under the influence of Kala. So in this material world we see material nature constituting of the Panchabhootas under the influence of Kala undergoing transformations. But Krishna's position is not within the Panchabhootas, not within the Kala, something that is beyond all of this. He is beyond. Whether it is the Rig Veda, whether it is the Upanishad, whether it is the Bhagavad Gita, all of them constantly repeat this

**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's transcendental position using references from the Bhagavad Gita, particularly focusing on how Krishna establishes this in the fourth chapter by stating he spoke yoga to Vivasvan long ago.

point. Krishna's position is Tamasaha Parastaat. Tamasaha refers to the material world, the Panchabhootas under the time. Tamasa also refers to ignorance, also refers to darkness. This nature of the material world is dark, and so Parastaat is beyond. Let's see how this material world is beyond. Let's see how Krishna establishes this, that his nature is very different and he is transcendental in the Bhagavad Gita. They say, there are many places, but in a very early part in the fourth chapter of the Gita, Krishna begins to establish this. Let's see how Krishna does this in a very interesting manner. In the fourth chapter, Krishna begins by saying, imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam. This knowledge, yoga knowledge, yogam, imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam. This avyaya yogam, this immutable, indestructible knowledge of yoga. imam vivasvate yogam proktavan prokta means I spoke. proktavan aham avyayam yogam aham proktan to whom? imam vivasvate yogam unto vivasvan. vivasvate yogam proktavan aham proktavan. avyaya yogam aham proktavan imam vivasvate unto vivasvaan. This imam avyayam yogam. Because in the second chapter of the Gita, Krishna spoke. He concluded about transcendental knowledge. Sorry in the third chapter. Krishna concluded that about thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material senses, mind and intelligence, one should control the lower self by the higher self and thus by spiritual strength conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.

That's how the third chapter ends. And then this, how this evam buddhe param buddhva, by this transcendental knowledge, transcendental intelligence, how you should conquer. So this knowledge concerning transcendence, yoga, this I spoke long ago to Vivasvan. This is how Krishna is beginning the fourth chapter. And when he hears this, when Arjuna hears this, he gets a doubt. And in the fourth verse, Arjuna, as I'm skipping a few verses, keeping focus on a certain point that we are discussing. Arjuna uvaca aparambhavato janma param janma vivasvataha katametad vijaniyam tvam adahoproktavaniti Arjuna is asking, Krishna, you are saying that you spoke this knowledge to Vivasvan. How could you do that? aparambhavato janma param janma vivasvataha You are born, you are very junior.

How can I understand? Just like, suppose I say, we are all here going to celebrate book distribution success, right? So, suppose I tell you this story. Three weeks back, I went to Delhi and I was aware there is some problem. There was a book marathon going on. And even I thought I should distribute some books to some important people. So I went to Delhi. I took with me a carton of books. And there was another devotee with me. We went to Red Fort in Delhi. And there was a big lawn beside the Red Fort. We went to the lawn in the Red Fort. And this devotee was with me with a carton of Bhagavad Gitas. And there I saw, there was a gathering and there was some security men and went through all of that. And there, you know, Delhi means security. All these are big issues. So, went there. And had an opportunity to meet Jawaharlal Nehru. And I told the devotee, I said, you know what? And I told the devotee, bring the books. And he opened the carton. And I presented the book to Jawaharlal Nehru. And next to him was Mahatma Gandhi. And I presented, get another book. And he gave me another. I presented another book to Mahatma Gandhi. He looked through the book. And next to him was Dr. Radhakrishnan. Then I remembered, oh, Prabhupada has criticized Radhakrishnan. He didn't understand Gita. So let me give him. I took another book. Dr. Radhakrishnan, this is Bhagavad Gita. You must read. You will understand better. And they were all very happy. And then I said, thank you very much for receiving. And then me and the devotee with me, we were happy. We gave the books to the first prime minister of the country. And we came back. And I come this and come back to Bangalore. And I tell you all of that. This is what we did. Then you will ask the question. Prabhu, how could you give Bhagavad Gita to Jawaharlal Nehru, your junior? Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhiji, they are very senior. How could you give? This is the question that Arjuna is asking. Just see. Aparambhavato janma param janmavivasvatah. How can I understand? You spoke this knowledge to Vivasvan. Vivasvan is param. He is much much senior to you. Katametadvijaniam tvamadau proktavaniti. You spoke. How can I understand? You distributed Gita to Jawaharlal Nehru.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's answer to Arjuna, emphasizing the difference between them: Krishna remembers his past lives and is unborn and inexhaustible, while Arjuna does not.

And now let's see what Krishna says for this. Only one question, Arjuna. Next verse is Sri Bhagavad Gita. Krishna is answering. bahunime vyatithani janmani tava ca arjuna tanyaham vedasarvani natvam vedtaparanthapa bahunime vyatithani janmani Many, many births, I have taken. Arjuna. bahunime vyatithani janmani many many birds I have passed, you have also passed Arjuna, not that only I have taken many birds and I have appeared many times, even you have taken many birds, TANI AHAM VEDA SARVANI, I am aware of all of those different appearances of mine, NATVAM VETA PARANTHAPA, THVAM NAVETA, you don't understand, you don't remember them, you are not able to remember all of that PARANTHAPA, so immediately Krishna is making a clear point, pointing out there is a difference between you and me just see very clear BAHUNI ME VYATI TANI JANMANI TAVACHARJUNA, TANI AHAM VEDA SARVANI, NATVAM VETA PARANTHAPA and let's see the next verse what Krishna says AJO PISAN NAVYAYATMA BHUTHANAM ISHVARO PISAN PRAKRITIM SWAM ADHISHTAYA SAMBHAVAM YATMAMAYAYA this is my position AJA I am unborn ABYAYATMA I am inexhaustible BHUTHANAM ISHVARO PISAN all existence, all living entities, I am the controller my position is different, Arjuna PRAKRITIM SWAM ADHISHTAYA this is my position situated in my position PRAKRITIM SWAM ADHISHTAYA SWAM PRAKRITI my own nature this is my nature nature, transcendental nature, situated in my adhishthaya, svam prakritim adhishthaya, adhishthaya means being fixed, being situated, prakritim svam adhishthaya sambhavami, I appear in this world, so my appearance, my taking birth here in this world is not the same as you taking birth, it is different, I am Aja, Avyaya, Bhutanam, Ishwaraha, and sprakritim

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's appearance in the world, using the analogy of a king visiting a prison to distribute sweets, and connects it to Krishna's purpose of protecting devotees, annihilating demons, and establishing dharma.

svam adhishthaya sambhavami, so Krishna is establishing that his position is transcendental, this is a very important point because Krishna is talking about, he is speaking to Vivaswami, he is coming to this world, to help us understand Srila Prabhupada gave an example, a simple example, one day there was a king and it was king's birthday, and the king decided, oh today is my birthday, how shall I celebrate, anyway so many parties and all those kind of things, all that happens, but this time the king decided, let me go to this world, to the prison and distribute some sweets, in the prison, prisoners suffering, so the king came to the prison to distribute sweets on his birthday, and the prisoners were watching, oh Maharaja has come, so the prisoners were discussing among themselves, see Maharaja has come to our prison, that means he has also become a prisoner, so Maharaja has come, now the king may come to the prison, but he maintains his royalty, his position as the king, prakriti svam adhishthaya sambhavami, situated in his transcendental position, he comes to this world, atmam ayaya, after saying this let us see what Krishna says, now you will immediately recognize, this is the famous verse of the Gita, yad kriyay, ya yadayadahi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata abhyuttanam udadharmasya tadatmanam srjamyaham After that, paritranaya sadhunam vinasayacha duskrutam dharmasam sthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge yuge So this is the context in which Krishna is telling how he appears yuga after yuga in order to protect the devotees, to annihilate the demons and to establish dharma. He is telling about his appearance in this world. And he is telling that how prakritim svamadhisthaya sambhavami atmamayaya So that we understand how he appears. Soon after that, let's see the next verse what Krishna says. janma karma chame divyam evam yo vethi tattvatah Just see. My birth, my activities are divyam. This is the position of Krishna. Krishna's position is transcendental. He is not a person of material world. His position is transcendental. His personality is transcendental. His nature is transcendental. His name, form, activities are all transcendental. janma karma chame divyam evam yo vethi tattvatah And if someone learns this, Krishna's nature, Krishna's appearance, Krishna's activities, all of these are transcendental.

We were meeting him in the evening, and he came, and he said, he had, in the morning, he had attended an address by Narendra Modi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and he said, Narendra Modi came to the gathering, and we could see he was full of anxiety. Narendra Modi said, Oh, now I understand, I don't want to worry about this. What happened? There was a kind of anxious appearance. And then he started speaking, and of course, after he started speaking, you know, he is a good speaker, he is a good orator, newspaper, so many kinds of difficulties, right? Very depressing, somebody is shouting India should happen this, that should happen, JNU campus and police attacking this, that. And you read the newspapers, it's very depressing. So many difficulties and our leaders in our country, they must be going through a lot of anxiety. Imagine Prime Minister's situation, so much anxiety and now in a few weeks few few days he has to release the budget for the country. So much tension. So if you look at the material world situation, whether it's in our country or whether it is in our world, you look at the world situation. Terrorists, Bombing and Taliban and this problem, that problem, refugees running away, all kinds of problems, international, national, and look at our own lives.

But this knowledge has an ability to help us come out of all of these problems. How does this work? I'll give you an example. This is an example that Srila Prabhupada also gives. Like say for instance, I am sleeping and in my sleep I am having a dream. And in the dream, I'll just take few minutes, extra minutes and wind up. And in the dream, I go with my friends to Banerjata, picnic, Banerjata we know, famous place. And while I am in the, I am having nice time, suddenly a leopard begins to chase all of us. Right? Familiar story. And we all start running. And we look behind, the leopard is running and we are all running. And here are my friends, here they are all, someone jumps up a tree and climbs. Oh my God, he made it to the tree and I am still running, looking behind. And somebody else goes away this side, that side. And finally I see the leopard has singled out on me. Oh God. And it's chasing me and I am running, running, running, oh full of anxiety and I look behind, all my friends, they are all feeling great relief that leopard has left them and I am seeing them, they are all just feeling it, you know, what, what they relieved, but I am still running and how anxious I will be. And then I am running and running in the midst of the forest. I see one building. Oh, great relief. I run towards the building and the leopard is behind me chasing and I, there is a door there, I push the door open and I jump, run in, get into the building, into that room and then I shut the door, latch it. Oh. And there is a window, I look out of the window, I look outside, the leopard is just there. Oh. Oh. I am so relieved and I look around and inside the room, there are ten more leopards. Oh. And these ten leopards are just getting up from their sleep and they are all, one dozen pairs of leopards staring at me. What an anxiety. What an anxiety it is, right? What shall I do? Again, I am slowly going towards the door, but I am remembering there is a leopard outside. What an anxiety I will be going through. How can someone help me? There is one way, one wonderful way to help me. Wake up. And I wake up and I say, oh. Oh. There is no leopard. There is no one dozen leopards, there is no one leopard, nothing. It was all a dream. How relieved I will be.

**Key Quote:** "Material existence is actually a dream... Each one of us being his part and parcel are also transcendental."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material existence is like a dream, and that we are all transcendental beings belonging to Krishna's world, but are currently absorbed in material energy.

So, material existence is actually a dream. What Krishna teaches in the Bhagavad Gita, in the Bhagavatam is that, not only is Krishna transcendental, each one of us being his part and parcel are also transcendental. We don't belong to this material domain at all. We belong to another world. Our coming into this world, taking this body made of Panchabhutas, our existence in this Panchabhuta existence of this material domain under Panchabhuta and Kala is itself a dream-like existence. And in the dream we will be having, we'll come across a lot of situation. This material domain is designed in such a way it constantly creates one anxiety after another anxiety. And that's what we are all going through individually, collectively, nationally, internationally. Just like you see how very good leaders in our country, in our world, brilliant people constantly applying their minds, constantly applying their intelligence, solving one problem after another problem, another problem, but still another new problem comes up. Just like you see how it is. Now this is our position. We are transcendental. We belong to Krishna. We belong to Krishna's world. But we are right now completely absorbed in the material energy, in the material domain. And it is said in the Vedic literatures When the living entity Jeeva is absorbed in this Panchabhuta, Kala existence, Swatha Yin yang by ourselves we cannot figure out what they really are because we can't actually come up with the exact meaning they really are. What is happening? We will go on solving one problem. By then another problem comes. Yet another problem will come. Like this we will be suffering. Maya Mugdha Ji. Nahi Swatha Krishna Gyan. Who is Krishna? Who we are? This knowledge we will not understand by ourselves.

### renunciation, Krishna consciousness, anger, liberation, sense control

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Becoming liberated does not necessitate losing one's sensual activities; sense activities continue even in the liberated stage."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, focusing on the role of a sanyasi, Krishna as the best friend, the nature of anger in liberated souls, and the continuation of sense activities in Krishna consciousness.

Purport by Srila Prabhupada According to the Vedic system, a sanyasi, a person in the renounced order of life, is dressed in saffron-colored garments. This saffron dress is practically a passport for the mendicant and sanyasi to go anywhere. The sanyasi's duty is to enlighten people in Krishna consciousness. Those in the renounced order of life have no other business but preaching the glories and supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, the Vedic sociological conception is that a sanyasi should not be restricted. He is allowed to go anywhere and everywhere he wants, and he is not refused any gift he might demand from a householder. The four Kumaras came to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. The word Suhrtama, best of all friends, is important. As Lord Krishna states in the Bhagavad Gita, He is the best friend of all living entities. suhrtam sarva-bhuta-anam No one can be a greater well-wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is so kindly disposed towards everyone that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord, He comes Himself. Sometimes personally, as Lord Krishna appeared on this earth, and sometimes as His devotee, as did Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and sometimes He sends His bona fide devotees to reclaim all the fallen souls. Therefore, He is the greatest well-wishing friend of everyone. And the Kumaras wanted to see Him. The doorkeepers should have known that the four sages had no other business, and therefore to restrict them from entering the palace was not apt. In this verse, it is figuratively stated that the younger brother of desire suddenly appeared in person when the sages were forbidden to see their most beloved personality of Godhead. The younger brother of desire is anger. If one's desire is not fulfilled, the younger brother anger follows. Here we can mark that even great saintly persons like the Kumaras were also angry, but they were not angry for their personal interests. They were angry because they were forbidden to enter the palace to see the personality of Godhead. Therefore, the theory that in the perfectional stage one should not have anger is not supported in this verse. Anger will continue even in the liberated stage. These four mendicant brothers, the Kumaras, were considered liberated persons, but still they were angry because they were restricted in their service to the Lord. The difference between the anger of an ordinary person and that of a liberated person is that an ordinary person becomes angry because his sense desires are not being fulfilled. Whereas a liberated person like the Kumaras becomes angry when restricted in the discharge of duties for serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the previous verse, it has been clearly mentioned that the Kumaras were liberated persons. Vidit Atma Tatva means one who understands the truth of self-realization. One who does not understand the truth of self-realization is called ignorant. But one who understands the self, the super-self, their inter-relation and activities in self-realization is called Vidit Atma Tatva. Although the Kumaras were already liberated persons, they nevertheless became angry. This point is very important. Becoming liberated does not necessitate losing one's sensual activities. Sense activities continue even in the liberated stage. The difference is however that sense activities in liberation are accepted only in connection with Krishna Consciousness. Whereas sense activities in the conditioned stage are enacted for personal sense gratification.

**Key Quote:** "They were eager to see their beloved master Lord Hari, and that was stopped by the two doorkeepers, and hence they became very disturbed."
**Summary:** The speaker breaks down the verse, explaining the context of the Kumaras' attempt to enter Vaikuntha, their qualifications, and the reason for their anger: being prevented from seeing Lord Hari.

So this verse is talking about So we have been reading about the sages trying to enter Vaikuntha and the two doorkeepers stopping them from entering the Vaikuntha Loka. These sages were, it is described here, Suarhatama. They were very, very qualified. They were not some unqualified persons trying to enter Vaikuntha. They were Suarhatama. And still, Nishidhyamanaha, they were forbidden. And when they were forbidden, Animesheshu Mishatsvu, there were many other personalities of the Vaikuntha. Animesha, Animesha refers to unblinking eye. It refers to Vishnu and it refers to Vishnu's associates. So Animesheshu Mishatsvu, they were all other residents of Vaikuntha. They were also watching over this. Nishidhyamana Suhratamahyapi Hare Pratiharapabhyam, Hari's Pratiharapabhyam, His doorkeepers, His associates, Pratiharapabhyam, they stopped them. So the sages began to speak, Uchuhu. From the next verse onwards, Munaya Uchuhu, sages will be speaking. So why were they and how did they speak? They were with angry words they spoke. Kamanujena sahasata upapluthakshaha, upapluthakshaha, their eyes became very agitated. And with what? With the Kama Anujena. Anuja means a younger brother. Kama Anujena refers to a younger brother of desire, Kama. And so Prabhupada has said that figuratively it means the anger. Kamanujena sahasa, suddenly they became angry. And importantly why did they become angry? They were suarhatta maha, they were most qualified. And in the previous verse we saw viditaatma tatvam, they were self-realized. And why did they become angry? That is disclosed in this verse. Because suhrthama didrikshita bhanga, they were didrikshita, very eager to see. They were eager to see whom? suhrthama, their beloved master Lord Hari. And that was bhanga, that was stopped by the two doorkeepers. And hence they became very disturbed. When the Kumaras although by far the fittest persons suarhatta maha api were thus forbidden entrance nishidhyamanaha by the two chief doorkeepers of Sri Hari Hare pratihara pabhyam while other divinities looked on animisheshu mishatsu Their eyes suddenly turned red upaplu thakshaha because of anger kamanujena due to their great eagerness didrikshita to see their most beloved master suhrthama didrikshita bhanga Sri Hari the personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "The sages are carriers of the message of the Lord; they have no interest other than to share the information about the Supreme Lord, the purpose of life, and what is that we should do in this human form of life."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's points about the Vedic sociological conception, emphasizing the importance of saintly persons (sadhus) in society and their role in disseminating spiritual knowledge.

So Prabhupada has touched upon many important points. The first one is that the sages were not to be forbidden because it is so in the, it is the sanyasi or a mendicant or a sage is permitted to go to any place and no one shall stop them. That is the, what Prabhupada has said here. This is the Vedic sociological conception. How a Vedic society is organized, how the Vedic society conducts is what is being described. Why is it so? Why is it that the sages should be allowed to go anywhere and no one should stop them? Because the sages are carriers of the message of the Lord. They have no interest other than to share the information about the Supreme Lord, the purpose of life and what is that we should do in this human form of life. So they have, they are meant to enlighten the society and hence they should not be stopped. This is the, important position of the sadhus in the Vedic sociological conception. From this we see, the important position given to a saintly person in the Vedic society. He is discharging a very important duty of enlightening the people about the spiritual values of life.

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Giving knowledge about self-realization is even far superior and more important than becoming a king and ruling over a kingdom."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of King Vena to illustrate the elevated position of brahmanas and the importance of spiritual knowledge over material power in Vedic society.

In another place, in the Bhagavatam, King Vena was a very impious king. And then, in the Vedic system, the king has to follow the directions of the brahmanas and rule and encourage and not only maintain the citizens in his kingdom, fulfilling their material needs, he also has an obligation to ensure that their spiritual needs are also fulfilled. But King Vena was not a good king. He was a sinful person and he didn't care for the brahmanas and he was not encouraging any spiritual activities in his kingdom. At that time, all the brahmanas in his kingdom come together and they discuss what is to be done. And they decide that they should kill King Vena. And they kill him. And then, it says, from Vena's body they created another person and made him the king. Now the question comes, if the brahmanas were so powerful that they could kill and dethrone a king, why couldn't they become the king themselves? After dethroning King Vena, because after all he was a bad king. And there Prabhupada explains, no, the brahmanas would not become the king because they had more important duties than becoming a king, which is, they were engaged in self-realization and they were engaged in teaching others in the society in the matter of self-realization. So you see from all of these kind of instructions, where Srila Prabhupada positions that activity of giving knowledge about self-realization is. It's even far superior and more important than becoming a king and ruling over a kingdom. So this is the kind of conception that Srila Prabhupada in all his teachings he brings about, about the role of a saintly person in the human society. And hence in the Vedic conception, such a saintly person should have free access to move around in the human society and give this knowledge to whoever was ready to receive this.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the reason for the Kumaras' anger, emphasizing their eagerness to see Krishna and the frustration of being prevented from doing so.

Then the important thing that we have been discussing in these verses is the sages becoming angry and the reason why they became angry is very nicely described in this verse. That is, suhrutthama didrikshita bhanga. Didrikshita means great eagerness, I want to see. So that was the drive for the sages. They were heading towards Vaikuntha to see their beloved Lord, suhrutthama didrikshita. They wanted to see their beloved Lord and bhanga and that was stopped. And hence they became kamanu jena sahasa.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'suhrutthama' (best friend) and introduces the question of why a benevolent God allows suffering.

Hence they became angry. Here Prabhupada has explained in the purport, suhrutthama. Suhrut means friend. Suhrutthama means the best friend. A superlative. Just like we have in Bhagavad Gita the words guhyam, guhyatama means the most confidential knowledge. In the same way here, suhrutthama, suhrut, suhruttara and suhrutthama. Suhrut means friend. Suhruttara means greater friend. Suhrutthama means most well-wishing friend. So the superlative is used. So Krishna is such a friend of all living entities.

**Key Quote:** "People suffer so much when there is a death in the family, rightfully someone very beloved to them."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts a personal experience of witnessing a family's grief after a death, prompting reflection on the nature of suffering and God's role in it.

Sometimes people ask this question. Especially when there are some miseries in this world, somebody is suffering. Why God is giving this suffering to me? Very recently I was in a, you may know that we had a program in Lucknow. So we were staying in a, in a devotees house. And so early in the morning at about 2.30 am I was suddenly woken up. What sounded like, you know sometimes in the night you hear the howling of dogs or something. It sounded like that. So woke up for a moment for a while. And then okay some dogs, stray dogs everywhere you know. And went back to sleep. And then again after a while at about 3.30 I was woken up. And then I realized what I had heard was not actually howling of dogs. It was wailing of people. And it was much louder at 3.30 am. I woke up and I tried to intently hear. I could make out there were at least two male grown up men's voice wailing. And many women wailing. And some children also wailing. Crying out. It was a very shocking thing. And you know it's all very cold in North India this time. So the windows were all shut. So I went to the window and tried to see. And then with great difficulty pushed the window open and I immediately as, as the cold wave hit, similarly there were loud wailing voices. Just hit me back. Just shut the door and I didn't know what to do. Something's wrong with the neighbors. And then I turned on the light and then I came out. And then the devotee of the house, the host where we were staying, he came down the steps and he said Prabhu, wait, wait some neighbor I'll just go see and come. And he wrapped himself with him. And then he walked out. And then and this wailing was continuing. And then after a while he came back and he said Prabhu, the neighbor somebody passed away. Some some old woman. And at 2.30 they rushed her to the hospital. And then at 3.30 they brought her back and they are dead. And she is dead. And there are her sons and daughters and grandchildren eight of them all of them are living there. And so then he went back and then by then I just got ready and we were chanting. So in the morning when I was chanting at that time it went on for about an hour. Loud wailing of men women children. So at that time when I was chanting you know when you come across this kind of a thing multiple thoughts come to your mind. At that time I was particularly thinking about how people suffer so much when there is a death in the family. Rightfully someone very beloved to them. And then I was also thinking about how people suffer when there is a death in the family. And it went on and on and on for nearly one hour. You know to be wailing like that so intense. And here we see Krishna is the best well-wishing friend of all living entities. And Krishna the Supreme Lord the Supreme Powerful Lord He has sanctioned such a misery to a family. Everyone is suffering. Why is this so? How do we understand why the Lord has sanctioned such intense suffering that people are crying so much? Why there is death like this? At that time I was

**Key Quote:** "Krishna devotes an entire chapter on the modes of material nature because they are very important for spiritual life."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of the three modes of material nature (sattva, rajas, tamas) from the Bhagavad Gita, explaining their influence on our consciousness and their importance in spiritual life.

reminded of one verse in the Bhagavad Gita. Very interesting verse. In the fourteenth chapter of the Gita Krishna is talking about the modes of material nature. Krishna devotes an entire chapter on the modes of material nature. Of course Krishna talks about modes of material nature very early even in the second chapter onwards. But there is an entire chapter devoted even in the eighteenth chapter Krishna is talking. But there is a there is a this fourteenth chapter is specially dedicated for the three modes of material nature because they are very important for spiritual life. Why it is important is very nicely described before I come to the verse connected with the wailing family members. Here Krishna says, sattvat sanjayate jnanam rajaso lobha evaca pramada mohav tamaso bhavato ajnanam evaca In summary Krishna describes in this verse what happens because of the influence of sattva, rajas and tamo gunas. sattvat sanjayate jnanam From sattva guna jnana comes about. So that is why for spiritual life sattva guna is very important. sattvat sanjayate jnanam rajaso lobha evaca By rajas greed comes about. sattvat sanjayate jnanam rajaso lobha evaca pramada mohav tamaso bhavato ajnanam evaca And because of tamasa three things Krishna is listing. One is pramada madness moha illusion ajnana bhavata ha and ignorance comes about. Just see because of tamo guna, because of tamasic influence. So this is the influence of the rajas, tamas, sattvam, rajas and tamas. And hence if we are under tamo guna we will be mad, we will be in illusion and we will be ignorant about the realities. So after describing all these effects of the three gunas, Krishna says something, as a last verse in this discussion. And then Arjuna asks a question. And the last verse that Krishna is describing in this, not the last verse of the chapter, but in this series of verses describing the three gunas and their influence and what happens and all of that. guna netan atitya triyam deha deha samud bhavan janma mrtyu jhara dukhair vimukto amrutam ashnute

**Key Quote:** "One will be freed from the dukkha of janma mrutyu jara dukkhair vimukta and amrutam ashnute, and one can enjoy immortality."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how to transcend the three modes of material nature, leading to liberation from birth, death, old age, and disease, and the attainment of immortality.

And then Krishna is saying there is one state of existence. What is that? etan gunan etan triyam gunan atityah gunan etan atitya triyam There is a state of existence when we can transcend the three modes of material nature. atitya triyam gunan atitya Dehi deha samud bhavan Deha samud bhavan The three modes, the three gunas are associated with the body. Deha samud bhava They are produced in this body. It's connected with the body. It's not connected with the Dehi. Dehi is the soul. Dehi is the occupant in the Deha. So there is Deha and there is Dehi. And the Deha, Deha samud bhavaha Trigunan The three modes of material nature are associated with the body. Gross body and the subtle body. Whereas Dehi, the soul is not connected with this and he is, he can be situated in a atitya gunan atitya ha stage. Then what happens if we do that? If we come to that stage of being transcendental to the influence of the three modes immediately Krishna gives a wonderful benefit. What is that? janma mrutyu jara dukkhair vimukto amrutam ashnute One will be freed from the dukkha of janma mrutyu jara dukkhair vimukta and amrutam ashnute ashnute means to enjoy. And one can enjoy immortality. One can enjoy what is deathlessness. In other words one will come to a transcendental state. One will come to a spiritual state when one understands that I am not the body I am a spirit soul and when he is able to understand that he is a spirit soul and nothing can affect that spirit soul. No weapon can destroy. Nothing can touch that spirit. Material things can touch that spirit soul. So janma mrutyu jara all these are things connected with the body and he will be freed from the sufferings. janma mrutyu jara dukkhair vimukto amrutam ashnute So the Supreme Lord Krishna is very concerned about our suffering. He is the Supreme Friend. And he is naturally concerned about our suffering. And hence he has given us a process how we can become freed from that. And we close our eyes to all that become influenced by the rajoguna and tamoguna become greedy in the material world become involved in material activities because of the tamoguna become mad after material things be in illusion be in ignorance and then complain what is this so much suffering Krishna is giving us in this material world? This is not fair. So Krishna has given us a process of becoming enlightened. If we don't take up this process by nature we will be like that especially in Kali Yuga. Kali Yuga things are not at all congenial for spiritual life. So in Kali Yuga the circumstances are arranged in such a way that rajas and tamas influence is very strong. So we have to take up some methods some spiritual process by which we will come out of the influence of rajoguna and tamoguna and then we will strive to come out of these influences come to sattva guna and even beyond guna netana tityatrin dehi deha samudbhavan we can come to that state. And this is what Krishna is teaching.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is meant for something very serious, something very grave; something serious is happening around us, there is suffering in this world, and we must know what to do, how to solve this problem."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes superficial approaches to spirituality, emphasizing the seriousness of human life and the need for genuine spiritual wisdom to address suffering, especially in Kali Yuga.

And that is why Srila Prabhupada says so this is not some kind of a magic thing magical thing some ashes are given some other magic is given some gold is given these are all actually very silly things. Human life is meant for something very serious something very grave something serious is happening around us there is suffering in this world and we must know what to do how to solve this problem there is some there is a spiritual wisdom connected with this and how to get that spiritual wisdom our most well wishing friend Krishna has provided that information instead of taking all these things very seriously very frivolously we consider we pursue spiritual life somebody is giving some ashes somebody is solving some problem somebody is giving some gold and people run after all these this is simply because of ignorance not knowing what is spiritual life what is going on in this world and very unfortunately there are many many people like this in Kali Yuga who are misleading people

**Key Quote:** "No one can be a greater well-wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead; he is so kindly disposed towards everyone that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord, he comes himself."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Krishna's unparalleled kindness and willingness to reclaim fallen souls, even when they have forgotten Him.

so Krishna being the well wishing friend Prabhupada has made a very nice point just like sometimes it happens in our human interaction if someone doesn't recognize us or respect us we will become very upset and turn away from that person next time he is coming this way you turn away that side look at that man he didn't recognize me last time why I should even smile at him we become very upset like that in the same way in a sense we have turned away from Krishna we have forgotten Krishna Krishna Baheer Mukha and that's what Prabhupada is saying here no one can be a greater well wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead he is so kindly disposed towards everyone that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord he comes himself sometimes personally we have forgotten him we have no interest in him and yet he comes personally Krishna comes personally as Lord Krishna appeared on this earth and sometimes as his devotee as did Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and sometimes he sends his bona fide devotees to reclaim all the fallen souls

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the unity of purpose between Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and the spiritual master in delivering spiritual knowledge and reclaiming fallen souls.

so sometimes Krishna comes himself in fact it is explained that Krishna came Prabhupada explains this Krishna came and he gave the spiritual knowledge he gave this there were many many occasions where Krishna gave this information but still people of Kali Yuga did not pick it up they did not understand so Krishna had to come once again next time as a devotee to demonstrate what is spiritual life and that happened as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu so Krishna coming or Krishna coming again as a devotee Chaitanya Mahaprabhu coming and then here something to be surprising very to be noticed in the same way it is of the same category Lord's descent Lord Chaitanya's descent a spiritual master appears in this world it's not a small thing because they have the same mission Krishna's mission Chaitanya's mission the spiritual master's mission is the same to reclaim the fallen souls to give that spiritual knowledge by which we can become janmam rutyu jhara dukhair vimukto amrutam ashnute how we can come to the platform of enjoying ashnute means to enjoy to relish that to relish that transcendental state free from immortality free from any worries about death disease old age all these things to give that wisdom the spiritual master appears so that is why the spiritual master appearance such a spiritual master who appears with this knowledge with this information with this purpose of giving this knowledge such a spiritual master

**Key Quote:** "The Guru is actually non-different from Krishna. Guru is Krishna Roopa. Krishna Roopa Hane. Shastrera Pramane."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Chaitanya Charitamrita to explain that the spiritual master is non-different from Krishna and delivers devotees on Krishna's behalf.

is not to be considered lightly this very there is a very nice verse in Chaitanya Charitamrta which describes this position of the spiritual master it says I had mentioned this some time back also I noticed another very interesting feature in this verse guru krishna roop guru krishna roopahana shastrera pramane guru roope krishna krupa karena bhaktagane this is a this verse says shastrera pramane by the evidence of all the vedic literatures shastrera pramane guru krishna roopa has one word here krishnaroo is one word that is why in Sanskrit when we read Bra היא s books if you see a hyphenated word if you go to the original you will see it is a one word just for the sake of reading it it has been hyphenated but here it is a guru krishna roopa krishna roopa is one word one word it is a hyphenated word guru krishna roopahana Shastrera Pramane. The Guru is actually non-different from Krishna. Guru is Krishna Roopa. Krishna Roopa Hane. Guru Krishna Roopa Hane. Shastrera Pramane. And in the next line, Krishna Das Kaviraj Goswami is writing, Guru Roopa. Guru Roopa is one word now. Guru Roopa Krishna Krupakarena Bhaktagane. Krishna Krupakarena. Krishna will deliver Krupakarena Bhaktagane. He will deliver the devotees. Krishna will do that. But how? Guru Roopa. In the form of the spiritual master, Krishna delivers. It's Krishna who is delivering. But how does he deliver? Guru Roopa. So Guru Roopa is one word. Guru Roopa Krishna Krupakarena Bhaktagane. So that is why Prabhupada translates this as, from the evidence of all the Vedic literatures, the spiritual master, Krishna Krupakarena Bhaktagane. So that is why Prabhupada translates this as, from the evidence of all the Vedic literatures, the spiritual master is to be considered as good as Krishna himself. Guru Krishna Roopa Hane. In the form of the spiritual master, Krishna delivers his devotees. Guru Roopa Krishna Krupakarena Bhaktagane. So this is the position of the spiritual master, who comes to deliver. He is playing the same role.

**Key Quote:** "The best use of intelligence is to realize, recognize, and realize this intimate relationship we have with Krishna, because that realization is going to put an end to all our suffering."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of realizing our intimate relationship with Krishna, who is our greatest well-wishing friend, and how this realization can end all suffering, connecting back to the initial verse about the Kumaras' eagerness to see Krishna.

He is playing the same role, same purpose that Krishna descended, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu descended, and the spiritual master descends for the same purpose, to reclaim the fallen souls. And they are playing the, representing Krishna, who is Suhruddhama. He is the best friend. And in one class, Prabhupada mentions, that if there is a, if there is a very close friend, with somebody we have a very close intimate relationship, just like our father and mother, we all have intimate relationship, right, because we, they gave birth to us, they looked after us when we were small. And we naturally recognize father and mother. And if we don't recognize father and mother, they will say, what kind of a man you are? Right? You are supposed to have, you are supposed to recognize the role of father and mother, with whom we have an intimate relation. But actually we understand that relationship is on a bodily level. We understand that ultimately we are a spirit soul. Now in the same way, or in a real way, as spirit soul, we have an intimate relationship. As a spirit soul, we have an intimate relationship. We have an intimate relationship with Krishna. He is Suhruddhama. He is the best well-wishing friend. Now, the best use of intelligence is, to realize, recognize and realize this intimate relationship we have with Krishna. Because that realization is going to put an end to all our suffering. And hence, when we don't recognize Krishna and come to the point of Krishna realization, if we don't come, we have not used our intelligence wisely. So, this is the message of the Gita and the Bhagavatam, that our greatest well-wishing friend is Krishna, and we must realize our relationship, we must recognize this, and come to the point of realizing that relationship. Suhruddhama. And because these sages were rushing to see their Suhruddhama, and because they were stopped, they became very angry like this. We will stop here.

### impurity, desire, anger, lust, Vaikuntha, Krishna consciousness

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "People should learn Bhagavad Gita and accept the Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna as the Lord of everything, they should practice satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord instead of trying to satisfy their own senses."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the Srimad Bhagavatam verse and Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the causes of falling into the material world and the path back to Vaikuntha through Krishna consciousness.

Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 15, Text number 34. He is stated in Bhagavad Gita, 7th Chapter, Verse 27. It is stated that as long as a living entity is pure, he is in complete harmony with the desires of the Supreme Lord. But as soon as he becomes impure, he is in disharmony with the desires of the Lord. By contamination, he is forced to transfer to this material world, where the living entities have three enemies, namely, desire, anger, and lust. These three enemies force the living entities to continue material existence, and when one is free from them, he is eligible to enter the kingdom of God. One should not, therefore, be angry in the absence of an opportunity for sense gratification, and one should not be lusty to acquire more than necessary. In this verse, it is clearly stated that the two doormen should be sent into the material world, where criminals are allowed to reside. Since the basic principles of criminality are sense gratification, anger, and unnecessary lust, persons conducted by these three enemies of the living entity are never promoted to Vaikunthaloka. People should learn Bhagavad Gita and accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna as the Lord of everything. They should practice satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord instead of trying to satisfy their own senses. Training in Krishna consciousness will help one be promoted to Vaikuntha. Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Let them go to this material world, where paapi asaha, sinful people live with three enemies."
**Summary:** The four Kumaras' curse on the doormen is explained, focusing on the doormen's destination: the material world, a place of sin and the three enemies (desire, anger, and greed).

So we are seeing in this part of the Bhagavatam, the four Kumaras trying to enter Vaikuntha, and they have been stopped by the two doormen, and the sages have become angry, and now they are speaking their angry words. And we are seeing in this part of the Bhagavatam, in this particular verse, they sort of take an action, what should be done with these two doormen. Manthadhi means intelligence. Manthadhi means they are not acting very intelligently. Manthadhibhyam, these two. So let us consider, dhimahi, let us consider what should be done. Karatumprakrshtumiha, we should do something to them that will actually eventually benefit them. Karatumprakrshtumiha. And what do they decide? Lokan itho vrajatam. Let them itaha, from here, in this Vaikuntha. Lokan vrajatam, let them go, go away from here. Lokan itho vrajatam, because, antharabhava drishtya, they have developed a vision of antharabhava. They have, the Lord has one bhava, but they have developed an antharabhava. So, they have developed this kind of antharabhava drishtya. So they should not be here. Lokan itho vrajatam. They should go away from here. Where should they go? Paapi asas, place where paapi asa, paapis, sinful, wicked people, go. And where? Traya ime ripavo asya yatra. Ripaha, ripavaha, is enemies. Traya ime ripavaha, is enemies. Traya ime ripavaha, traya ripavaha, where people in this material world, let them go to this material world, where paapi asaha, sinful people live with three enemies. Ripavaha, traya ripavaha, let them live there, let them go to the place where living entities live with three enemies. Therefore let us consider, dhimahi, how these two contaminated persons, mandadhibhyam, should be punished. Kartum prakristam. The punishment should be apt. For thus, benefit can eventually be bestowed upon them. Prakrshtam ehah! Since they find duality in the existence in vaikunta life. Antharabhava drishtya. They are contaminated, mandadhibhyam, and should be removed from this place, vrajatam, to the material world, lokan, itho vrajatam, where living entities have three kinds of enemies,

**Key Quote:** "The reason why pure souls come into existential circumstances of the material world, which is the purport of the material world, is because of the purport of the material world."
**Summary:** This segment discusses why pure souls enter the material world, referring to it as the 'criminal department' of the Supreme Lord, as explained in Bhagavad Gita.

traya ime ripavo asya yatra ha. So Srila Prabhupada has mentioned some very significant things in the purport. This is an example of two perfected living entities in the spiritual world, the doorman. The doorman of Vaikuntham, lokan, itho vrajatam, living the spiritual world and coming to this material world. So Prabhupada has used this word in the purport. The reason why pure souls come into existential circumstances of the material world, which is the purport of the material world, is because of the purport of the material world. The purport of the material world, which is considered to be the criminal department of the Supreme Lord, is stated in Bhagavad Gita, chapter 7, verse 27. So how the living entities, pure souls, come into this material world, what causes that? Why they come into this material world? And that is what is happening here, and that is explained, Prabhupada is saying, that the purport of the material world is said in the purport of the material world. As the çünkü.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The living entities, bewildered, come into this material existence."
**Summary:** The lecture explores the fall of living entities from the spiritual world, citing Bhagavad Gita 7.27 and explaining the concepts of 'dvandva moha' (delusion of duality) and its connection to desire and envy.

So this verse, Prabhupada referred to this verse. Even during Srila Prabhupada's time, there would be discussions among devotees. So the living entities fall from the spiritual world. If they're in the spiritual world, the moral Ninevayas must be perfect. But, they fall to the material world. How does that happen? So that is explained in the seventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Ichcha dvesha samuthena dvandva mohena bharata. Sarva bhutani sammoham sargeyanti parantapa. Sarga means creation. Remember that verse in the Bhagavatam we read some time back. There are ten topics in the Bhagavatam: Sarga, visarga, creation, secondary creation, and so on. So Krishna is referring to the creation. Sargeyanti. Yanti means to come or to go, to go to the sarga, to go to the material creation. Yanti deva vratan devan. So yanti means to go. Sargeyanti parantapa. So this is actually referring to living entities going to the material creation. So living entities falling to the material world. So why does that happen? Sarva bhutani sammoham sargeyanti parantapa. The living entities, bewildered, come into this material existence. What is that bewilderment? Dvandva mohena bharata. Ichcha dvesha samuthena dvandva mohena bharata. Dvandva moha. Delusion of duality. That's what Krishna is saying here in the Gita. The same thing we are seeing here in the Bhagavatam. Antarbhava drishtya. Dvandva moha. Dvandva means duality. Having a desire and interest different from the Lord. That is called dvandva moha.

### desire, envy, Krishna, duality, dictionary analogy

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Having a desire and interest different from the Lord. That is called dvandva moha."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on 'dvandva moha' as having desires different from the Lord, using the analogy of parts of the body serving the whole and then suggests reading verses before and after for context, like looking up surrounding words in a dictionary.

Just like here, antarabhava drishtya. So as living entities, we are part and parcel of the Lord. It is natural that we must have an interest like the Lord. Our interest must be perfectly aligned with the interest of the Lord. But when we develop a different desire, a different understanding, a different mentality, antarabhava, then that is called dvandva moha. And then, because of that dvandva moha, itchha dvesha samuthena comes about. Prabhupada has explained very nicely what is this itchha dvesha. Itchha means desire. Here it is specifically referring to desire to become the supreme. In fact, if you see in this material world, everyone in every field tries to become the foremost. Businessmen try to become the richest. Students try to become the smartest. Famous people try to become the most famous. Powerful people try to become the most powerful. So they are actually, this is the desire. The living entity is driven by that desire. Itchha. And dvesha is envy of Krishna. When you hear that Krishna is the supreme, the thought, why should I accept Krishna is the supreme? Why Krishna is the supreme? Why can't I be the supreme? These two desires, itchha dvesha samuthena dvandva mohena bharata. Actually, a living entity is not expected to have this kind of a thinking. A living entity is part and parcel of the Lord. Just like every part of the body tries to serve the whole body. That is natural. And when the part develops a different attitude, it is called antarabhava drishtya. Dvandva moha. Sarvabhutha nisamoham sargeyanti paranthi. Actually, it's interesting to see in what context Krishna says this. It's good to, like I remember sometime long ago, someone had told, when you read a, when you see a word in a dictionary, like sometime, of course now you don't see a dictionary, all these days are gone. You google. When you see a word in a dictionary, some, you know, some old people's good advice, you see one word before that and one word after that and learn two words, so you learn three words. In the same way, when you read a verse in the Gita, it's good to see one verse before and one verse after, and you'll get to see the context, and it'll help us develop a certain interesting perspective.

### Krishna's knowledge, delusion, duality, desire, hate

**Key Quote:** "All living entities are born into delusion overcome by the dualities of desire and hate, this is the reason why they don't know me."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the verses surrounding Bhagavad Gita 7.27 to understand why Krishna says people don't know Him, attributing it to delusion, duality, desire, and hate.

So let's see why Krishna is saying this in the seventh chapter and we'll come back to the Bhagavatam verse soon after that. Krishna is saying, vedaham samatitani vartamanani caarjuna bhavishyani chabhutani mamtu vedana khaschana. Krishna is saying, I know, vedaham, aham vedah, I know samatitani, atitani sama, I know equally atitani, what is in the past, vartamanani, what is in the present, bhavishyani, what is in the future. I know the past, present, and the future. Chabhutani, and I know all the living entities. I know the past, I know the present, I know the future, I know all the living entities. Mamtu vedana khaschana, but me nobody knows. Mamtu vedana khaschana, khaschana mam na vedah, they don't know me actually. Krishna is developing this idea how people don't know me. Naham prakashasarvasya yogamaya samavrta hamudoyam na, anyway I won't go into those things. There is a very interesting line of thinking that Krishna is developing and then he has come to this point, mamtu vedana khaschana, me nobody knows. Why they don't know? Krishna is explaining in the next verse why is it that they have come to this state that they don't know me in the material world because, O son of Bharata, O conqueror of the four, all living entities are born into delusion overcome by the dualities of desire and hate. This is the reason why they don't know me because they are born into this material existence with this duality, delusion of duality and they have become, they have been overcome by this desire and hate, iccha dvesha samuttena. But what is this iccha? What is this dvesha? We need the help of the acharyas to understand that iccha refers to desiring to become the supreme ourselves. Dvesha means not willing to accept Krishna as the supreme, why can't I be the supreme? That envy, the desire and the envy and dvandva moha, duality, delusion of duality, a difference of understanding that we should not have actually.

**Key Quote:** "Those who have ended sinful activities and performing pious and virtuous activities, they have become freed from this duality."
**Summary:** The lecture shifts to Bhagavad Gita 7.28, explaining how to return to the spiritual world by ending sinful activities, performing virtuous deeds, and serving pure devotees.

In the next verse Krishna explains who is eligible to go back to the spiritual world. This first, this verse is talking about how the living entities came to this world, now how can they go back to the spiritual world that Krishna is saying in the next verse. Ye santmantagatam papam jananam punyakarmanam tedvandvamohamirmukthabha bhajanthemam dhrudabhrataham. Ye santmantagatam papam, those who have ended sinful activities, antagatam papam, jananam punyakarmanam, and performing pious and virtuous activities, tedvandvamohamimukthah. They have become freed from this duality, having a different idea. They worship me with firm determination. We will come to this verse a few minutes later. There are some interesting things. So, the sages are deciding that these two living entities, they have developed this, so they should leave this Vaikuntha and they should go to the material world. And what is that material world? Actually, the word Papi, we all generally understand, as one who has done Papa, right? Papi and Papa. So, actually, originally the meaning word, the word Papi means most wicked person, evil person, such a person. So, let them go to the place where such evil, wicked people go. People. And what do they do? They live with three enemies. Let them go to that world. See? That is why here, in this verse also, this contrast is there. Punya also, again, one understanding is pious. Papa means sinful. Actually, Punya means very elevated, very exalted, very exalted. Opposite of Papa, means very wicked, lowest. So, here, Punya-Karmana means activities in relation with Punya, virtuous. Acharyas describe that Punya-Karmana refers to serving a pure devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of serving devotees for liberation and introduces the three enemies (lust, anger, and greed) from Bhagavad Gita 16.21, which lead to the degradation of the soul.

If you read the purport also, Prabhupada is talking about that. It is stated in the Srimad Bhagavatam, that if one actually wants to be liberated, he must render service to the devotees. See, Punya-Karmana actually refers to serving devotees, because they are the most exalted people, and should have ended antagatam papam, that sinful desires, sinful activities, one should have ended. So, here, the sages are saying, they should go to Papiyasaha. Papiyasaha. Praya ime ripavo asya yatra. The three enemies, that is also Prabhupada has referred. That is also here in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna refers to in the 16th chapter, the three enemies of the living entity. Trividham narakasyedam dvaram nashanam atmanah. This is the chapter which we are all chanting now, 16th chapter. Dvaram nashanam atmanah. Kamah krodhas tatha lobhas tasmad etat trayam tyajet. So, Krishna is saying, Nara idam narakasyat dvaram. These three, Trividham narakasyat dvaram. Trividham narakasyedam dvaram nashanam atmanah. And this is one which, na atmanah nashanam. This can destroy. How soul can never be destroyed? What do we mean by that? Here, it is referring to degradation of the soul. Atmanashanam. It does not mean that soul will be destroyed, because soul can never be destroyed. It is already, na jayate namriyate. It is understood. Here, atmanashanam. That is why when we are reading the Vedic literatures, we should see it is to be, the meaning should be taken according to the context. So, Trividham narakasyetam dvaram nashanam atmanah. And what are the three things? The three doors to hell. Narakasya, kamah krodhah tatha lobha. Lust, anger, and greed.

**Key Quote:** "One should give up these three activities, kama, krodha and lobha."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses how lust, anger, and greed are glorified in modern society, making Kali Yuga a difficult age for practicing Krishna consciousness.

And Krishna's recommendation is tasmad. Therefore, see, Prabhupada says, whenever tasmad is used, it is like a conclusive statement. Krishna is making a conclusion after having analyzed something. These three are the gateways to hell and leads to the degradation of the soul. So, therefore, tasmad etat trayam tyajet. One should give up these three activities, kama, krodha, and lobha. And if you see in the material world, in our present civilization, these three qualities are highly glorified. Kama, lust. It is highly promoted. Kama, krodha. Okay, krodha to some extent it is very, even for good living, comfortable material living, is not very encouraging. So, it is not so much advised. Lobha, greed. There is no such thing. One can be, one could, material civilization, Kali Yuga civilization encourages one to rise to higher and higher and higher. Keep trying, keep struggling, working hard. So, these are the three which are considered to be ripavaha, enemies of the living entities. And, this is a world where paapiya sahatraya ime ripavo asya yatra. So, just see the, the things that are, how in the material world, how we look at things. And this is highly glorified. All the newspapers, media, everywhere, cinemas, everything, karma is encouraged. And, there is nothing wrong about it, people think. It is highly promoted. And, on the other hand, Krishna is saying, tasmadetatrayam tyajet. So, that is why, Kali Yuga is considered a very unfortunate age for those who are trying to practice Krishna consciousness,

**Key Quote:** "Material world is an abominable place."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the common perception of the material world as great with the perspective of enlightened sages, who see it as a terrible place where living entities are disturbed by the three enemies without even realizing it.

maybe we will find many, many kinds of hurdles. So, paapiya sahatraya ime ripavo asya yatra. And, we also see a certain perspective, the sages are showing. These two people, who have antarbhava drishtya, lokaan ito vrajatam. They should go away from here, and go to, paapiya sahatraya ime ripavo asya yatra. They should go to the material world. Actually, we here in the material world, we think, oh, our world is so great. Our country is so great. Our place is so great. Our, you know, so many nice things are there. But, the living entity, the great sages, in their estimation, material world is an abominable place. This is not a great place. That is why, Srila Prabhupada always quoted Bhaktisiddhant Saraswati Thakur saying, this is not a place, this is not a place for a gentleman. This is the perspective actually we must have. When we, this is an enlightened perspective. We should have a perspective of enlightened persons. The sages are enlightened persons. How they look at the material world, it's actually a terrible place. The living entities, they are caught up in this material world. And the three enemies are constantly disturbing them, and they don't even know that. Imagine you are thinking, he is your great friend and you are having always, you are always having him with you. You are always consulting him. But actually you don't know he is your enemy. How unfortunate. And he is always advising us and we are following that. Lust, anger, greed, these things are constantly influencing us, and we are accepting that influence and we are working in that direction.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes with Srila Prabhupada's recommendation to learn Bhagavad Gita, accept Krishna as the Supreme Lord, and practice Krishna consciousness, emphasizing the importance of pleasing a pure devotee.

Just see. And, finally, Srila Prabhupada concludes very nicely. People should learn, since the, that is why Prabhupada uses the word paapiya saha in the sense of a crime, criminality. In these last two purports, if you see, Prabhupada is using this, using the word criminal department. This material world is a criminal department in the sense of paapiya saha. Since the basic principles of criminality are sense gratification, anger, and unnecessary lust, persons conducted by these three enemies of the living entity are never promoted to Vaikunthaloka. People should learn Bhagavad Gita and accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna as the Lord of everything. So this is Prabhupada's recommendation here towards the end of the purport. People should learn Bhagavad Gita and accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna as the Lord of everything. They should practice satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord instead of trying to satisfy their own senses. And for doing this one, training in Krishna consciousness will help one be promoted to Vaikuntha. So there is a certain training that is required. Training in Krishna consciousness that will help one be promoted to Vaikuntha. And Srila Prabhupada has established an institution for training. And in this institution, in the process for this training to go back to Vaikuntha, a very important principle again and again explained in the Vedic literatures is that one should please a pure devotee.

**Key Quote:** "If you serve Tamal Krishna and Vishnu Jana nicely, I'll be very happy."
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the principle of pleasing a pure devotee through the example of Prabhupada instructing devotees to serve Tamal Krishna Maharaj and Vishnujan Maharaj, highlighting the importance of serving leaders within the institution to fulfill Prabhupada's mission.

This is an inescapable principle. So how has Prabhupada instituted this in this institution where Prabhupada has said that this institution can train us to go back to Vaikuntha? One very interesting example where Prabhupada points out this principle. During Prabhupada's time there were several devotees. It was headed by Tamalkrishna Maharaj and Vishnujan Maharaj. These two sannyasis they were heading a group of Brahmacharis called it was called Radha Damodar Traveling Sankirtan Party. RDTSKP it was called those days. So it became a very successful Traveling Sankirtan Party. The two sannyasis both very good preachers leaders at that time those days and they were traveling in from one city to another city conducting programs in American universities and they recruited many many devotees hundreds of devotees they were recruiting and they had three big buses and they used to have Radha and Damodar Deities that's why it was called Radha Damodar Traveling Sankirtan Party. So one time these some of these devotees they were who were made devotees they were all they had joined the temples or joined the traveling party and Prabhupada had come to one place and then these devotees were all lined up about hundred of them American young boys clean shaved up and they were all given a rose flower and they lined up and they came and offered the rose flower to Prabhupada offered their obeisance and then and Prabhupada was very happy and then he all of them were sitting there and then Prabhupada addressed them young Bhaktas all young from the American universities so in that short address Prabhupada says if you serve Tamal Krishna and Vishnu Jana nicely I'll be very happy so this is an actually Prabhupada showing an important principle if you serve Tamal Krishna and Vishnu Jana nicely I'll be very happy so this is the system that Prabhupada created in the institution institution has certain leaders and if we work to serve them nicely this is exactly this is what the devotees some of them recalled and they said Prabhupada said if you serve Tamal and Vishnu Jana nicely I'll be very happy and that will please the spiritual master because this is an institution serving Prabhupada's mission and in an institution it is expected that there is somebody playing the role of a leader and everyone following the leader's direction and the vision and going ahead and doing different activities and if we do this as an institution it is serving Prabhupada's mission that will please him so it's actually a very important principle of course the leaders have a very big responsibility they have to represent Prabhupada they have to themselves be following Prabhupada's instructions properly and they should be constantly having that vision of serving Prabhupada's mission that's the responsibility of the leaders and if the devotees are serving them in fulfilling the mission of the institution that is pleasing pure devotees spiritual master Srila Prabhupada this is the institutional system that Prabhupada has set up and if we work in this institutional set up we will be trained training in Krishna consciousness will come about and will help one be promoted to Vaikuntha so even in very simple occasions like this Srila Prabhupada what he said is something very significant and this is an important principle that is actually working in the institution and if the leaders are playing their role properly and if the devotees are serving the leaders and following the systems and the services that have been assigned then this whole training process will be working and Srila Prabhupada will be pleased and Prabhupada will be blessing the devotees and we will be making progress to go back to the spiritual world

**Key Quote:** "Although by chance the doormen committed a mistake by checking the brāhmaṇas from entering the gate of Vaikuntha, they were at once aware of the gravity of the curse."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains how the doormen of Vaikuntha reacted to being cursed by the Kumaras, understanding the gravity of offending devotees.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 15, Text No. 35: teṣām itīritaṁ bhāvava dhārya-gōraṁ tam brahma-dandam anivāraṇaṁ astra-pūgaiḥ sadyo hareranu ca rāvuru bhibhyatāstāt pāda-gṛhāva patatārāṁ tāmatikātare nāṁ teṣām itīritaṁ bhāvava dhārya-gōraṁ tam brahma-dandam anivāraṇaṁ Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupāda: "When the doormen of Vaikunthaloka, who were certainly devotees of the Lord, found that they were going to be cursed by the brāhmaṇas, they at once became veiled. They were very much afraid and fell down at the feet of the brāhmaṇas in great anxiety, for a brāhmaṇa's curse cannot be counteracted by any kind of weapon. Although by chance the doormen committed a mistake by checking the brāhmaṇas from entering the gate of Vaikuntha, they were at once aware of the gravity of the curse. There are many kinds of offences, but the greatest offence is to offend a devotee of the Lord. Because the doormen were also devotees of the Lord, they were able to understand their mistake and were terrified when the four kumaras were ready to curse them." Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport.

### material world, curse, fear

**Key Quote:** "So in other words, when they were told, go to the material world, that was considered to be a curse."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the doormen's fear of being sent to the material world, emphasizing that it was considered a curse by residents of Vaikuntha.

So we are seeing here, the four kumaras, who were checked by the two doormen of Vaikuntha from entering the Vaikuntha loka, and they were angry and they cursed the two doormen, and here we are seeing the response. We saw them cursing, or considering, in the previous verse, and in this verse we see their reaction of the two doormen. When they heard that they were cursed to go to the material world, they understood what a grave thing, mistake, they have done: avadharya ghoram. tad brahmadandam anivaranam astrapugaihi. And they also realised, they became fearful about brahmadandam, the curse of a brahmana, which is anivaranam, nivaranam, anivaranam, which cannot be counteracted. astrapugaihi. One may think that I am very powerful, I have so many weapons, you may have any kind of weapons, but by these weapons you cannot, anivaranam, you cannot counteract brahmadandam. So realising this, avadharya ghoram, brahmadandam, anivaranam, astrapugaihi, anivaranam, what did they do? sadyaha, immediately, harer anucarao, those devotees, who are followers of hari, uruvibhyatas, full of fear, tadpada grahao apatatam, they fell at the feet of the sages, holding to their feet, apatatam, fell down, atikatha rena, with great anxiety in their heart. So when the doorman of Vaikunthaloka, who was certainly devotees of the Lord, harer anucarao, found that they were going to be cursed by the brahmanas, brahmadandam, they at once became very much afraid, uruvibhyatas, and fell down, apatatam, at the feet of the brahmanas, pada grahao apatatam, in great anxiety, atikatha rena, for a brahmana's curse, brahmadandam, cannot be counteracted, anivaranam, by any kind of weapon, astrapugai. So, we can see here, and Prabhupada has mentioned, because they were themselves devotees, they understood how grave ghoram it was to have offended the sages, and the sages becoming upset with them, and cursing them. So they became, they were, they became aware, they understood, avadharya ghoram, they understood what a grave mistake they have committed, and they became fearful, urubhibhyataha, and they fell at the feet of the brahmanas, atikatha rena, with great anxiety. And, so, what was the curse that the brahmanas, the sages had pronounced on them, that we saw in the previous verse, loka nitho vrajatam, go to the material world. So that was the curse about which they became very fearful, they became very anxious. So in other words, when they were told, go to the material world, that was considered to be a curse.

**Key Quote:** "If you want to know the value of something, say some ornament... you have to go to a goldsmith... So in the same way, we have to get an estimation of anything, we have to go to a goldsmith."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a goldsmith valuing jewelry to illustrate the importance of understanding the material world from the perspective of enlightened individuals.

So now we should understand, we are all here in this material world, what people of the spiritual world, how they estimate this world. This is a world where people, when they are cursed, they go there. Right? But we think this is a very wonderful place, maybe some things are not alright, we will fix it. In course of time, we will fix it, and we will make it a very good place to live. In, in Indian government language, there is one expression, "punishment posting." If some IAS officer, bureaucrat, they don't cooperate with the politicians, or something, then the politicians will transfer them to Andaman, Nicobar Islands. And that's considered to be a punishment posting. So in the same way, this material world is considered to be a punishment posting for those living entities who are not willing to cooperate and be in harmony with the spiritual atmosphere. If we want to estimate, so in this way, we have to look at how this world is estimated by enlightened sages, or by residents of the spiritual world, how they rate this material world. We get a certain understanding from this verse. Just like if you want to know the value of something, say some ornament, sometimes we, some people drop some, some jewellery in the hundi, and then when we get that jewellery, and we want to make an estimate, how much it is, is it real gold, or some imitation jewellery, somebody dropped, now if you want to make an estimation of that, you have to go to a goldsmith, a goldsmith will check out, and then, because he is an expert in that, he will tell you it's worth how much money. So in the same way, we have to get an estimation of anything, we have to go to a goldsmith. If you go to a blacksmith, and take a piece of jewellery, you are not going to get very good understanding. So in the same way, we have to get an understanding of this, of this world, from those who are enlightened. That is the spirit, that is the perspective.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is using the word, you must approach, tatvadarshinah, those who have, those who have seen the truth."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize the importance of seeking knowledge from those who have realized the truth and are detached from sense gratification.

Because if people who don't, who are not enlightened, their views are not very important. That is why when Krishna says, tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya, upadekshanti te jnanam jnaninas tatvadarshinah, Krishna is using the word, you must approach tatvadarshinah, those who have, those who have seen the truth. In other words, those who are experiencing the truth, tatvadarshinah, no use going to an ordinary person if you want to get spiritual knowledge. In this context, Prabhupada also said, we should read books written by tatvadarshis, those who have actually seen the truth, very enlightened people. From their point of view, we should understand our life, our situation, our world, everything. Then we will be able to derive benefit from that. There is another verse in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna refers to the similar thing, that how, actually many times, but in this particular place, yasya sarve samarambha, kama sankalpa varjitaha, jnanagni dhadda karmanam, tamahuhu panditam buddhaha. In the chapter 4, text number 19, this is same as the, tamahuhu panditam buddhaha, these people are considered to be buddhaha, wise, by panditas. Sometimes somebody may consider them to be a wise man. Right? Like all our parents consider us to be very intelligent, my son is so intelligent. We may not be doing very well, but still our parents, out of love, they may say. So that's not important, we have to, whether we are wise, considered to be buddhaha, by panditas, tamahuhu panditam buddhaha. That is important. So Krishna is saying here, yasya sarve samarambha, kama sankalpa varjitaha, jnanagni dhadda karmanam, tamahuhu panditam buddhaha.

**Key Quote:** "In all endeavors, kama sankalpa varjitaha, they have given up the desire for enjoyment, kama, self-enjoyment, or sense gratification."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of 'kama sankalpa varjitaha' from the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting the importance of giving up desires for sense gratification to attain true knowledge.

In all endeavors, sarve samarambha, in all endeavors, kama sankalpa varjitaha, they have given up the desire for enjoyment, kama, self-enjoyment, or sense gratification. Because in every endeavor, a conditioned soul tries to enjoy. What is it that I can get for my sense gratification? Because that's the nature of the conditioned soul, when we come to spiritual life also, in spiritual life also we will be seeing how I can get some sense gratification. So that's the sad part. That is what we have to be watching out. So, yasya sarve samarambha, kama sankalpa varjitaha, so they have given up varjitaha, kama sankalpa, that determination or that desire for kama, varjitaha, jnanagni dhadda karmanam, such people who have become free from desire for sense gratification, in all their endeavors, such people have actually burned their fruitive reactions in the fire of knowledge. Which means, Prabhupada points out very nicely, kama sankalpa varjitaha is a result of being situated in jnana. So, if we are situated in transcendental knowledge, the effect of that is, in all our endeavors, we will not be looking for sense gratification. Conversely, if in all our endeavors we are looking for sense gratification, that is an indication we are not situated in jnana, we are still in ajnana. So, this is what great learned men consider. One is understood to be in full knowledge, whose every act is devoid of desire for sense gratification. He is said by sages to be a worker whose fruitive action is burnt up by the fire of perfect knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "This kind of a perspective, we must have an understanding, we must have an estimation of this material world. What is this material world about? From the perspective of enlightened people."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the need to view the material world from the perspective of enlightened individuals, using the analogy of animals praising each other to illustrate the importance of qualified praise.

This kind of a perspective, we must have an understanding, we must have an estimation of this material world. What is this material world about? From the perspective of enlightened people. And they consider this place to be a place, a most undesirable place, when compared to the spiritual world. If we don't have an estimation from enlightened perspective, we will be very mislead. Bhagavatam says, there is another verse in the Bhagavatam, shva-vid-varaha-ustra-karai samsthuta-purusha-pashuhu. Samsthutaha means to be praised by another person. samsthuta-purusha-pashuhu. In the material world, sometimes we come across one person praising another person. If one person is praising another person, who is that person who is praising? That is important. Otherwise, the example here given is shva-vid-varaha-ustra-karai shva-vid-varaha-ustra-karai, shva is dog, vid-varaha is a hog, pig, and ustra is a camel, karaha is a donkey. If these kind of animals, samsthutaha, they are glorifying, oh, he is such a great man. So these kind of animals will glorify another animal only. Because that is their perspective, after all. So, samsthutaha-purusha-pashuhu. Another person, they are glorifying, he is also like another, he is an animal only. So, the person who is praising must have requisite qualifications. So, if he is qualified, then his estimation, oh, he is praising somebody, he is praising something that has value.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the material world as a terrible place where living entities are in disharmony with their constitutional position and the Lord, emphasizing the lack of cooperation.

So, we see from the perspective that is presented here in the Bhagavatam about the material world, is that this is actually a terrible place. Constantly the living entities are absorbed in sense gratification. They are completely in harmony in disharmony with their constitutional position. They are completely in disharmony with the Lord. Although they are part and parcel of the Lord, they are not in harmony. Just like any part of our body, if it is not in harmony with the rest of the body, that part of the body, that organ of the body will become, is considered to be a diseased part. It will be a source of pain for us. So, all the parts of the body are meant to cooperate for the whole body. That's the constitution, that is the makeup, that is the way this body is constituted. If any part of the body is not in harmony with the whole body's well-being, then it will become a problem. So, just see what is our position in this material world. All the living entities who are not willing to cooperate with the Supreme Lord. And ours is a society full of people who are in this kind of a mentality. We are all, this material world is meant for people who are unwilling to cooperate. This is the understanding. And so when the two doormen heard that these sages are cursing us to go there. Oh! Uruvibhyataha! Became very, very fearful. Aniva... Avadharya ghoram! Oh! What a mistake! What a ghoram! What a big thing, mistake we have done. They started realizing that. So, this is how, this is the conception we must always maintain about this material world.

**Key Quote:** "Then we will not become attached. We will not become attached to any particular circumstance, particular situation. We can remain detached. And it will help us to be focused on Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that understanding the undesirable nature of the material world leads to detachment and focus on Krishna consciousness, quoting Srila Prabhupada's view of the modern world as a great calamity.

Then we will not become attached. We will not become attached to any particular circumstance, particular situation. We can remain detached. And it will help us to be focused on Krishna, Krishna Consciousness. Otherwise there is every chance that we will become very attached to this material world, not knowing actually this is not a very desirable place. Once in 1974, Srila Prabhupada wrote a letter. He had one disciple who had some law background and educated person. And then Prabhupada was encouraging him to... I mean he was also in a very senior position. At that time he was a GBC. And Prabhupada was saying, Prabhupada was encouraging him. Even in an earlier occasion, Prabhupada had encouraged him after he became a devotee, he should try to participate even in American politics. And... And Prabhupada had a wish that if devotees can become leaders in the society and if the society can be changed in that way, then it can be great. It is a great benefit. So in 1974, Prabhupada writes in a letter, "At the present moment, there is nothing but great calamity. But by injecting Krishna consciousness into the masses, we can change the situation greatly." So Prabhupada saw our material world, modern world situation to be, there is nothing but great calamity. In Kali Yuga, material world itself is a very fearful place. And in the material world, there are phases of time and Kali Yuga is considered the worst of all the phases of time, of all the Yugas. And we are here in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual learning is a very vast learning. And any learning requires qualification. If one does not have the qualification, you cannot learn higher things."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the gradual development of spiritual knowledge, highlighting the need for qualification and the compassionate role of Lord Buddha in addressing the misuse of Vedic principles.

Some time back, just about 2-3 weeks back, I went to a place, a Buddhist place. And then there was a Buddhist leader and there was a big gathering of Buddhist followers. And then the organizers told us there are 30,000 people here, all Buddhists and following and from all over the world they have come. Then suddenly dawned, I was just reflecting, 30,000 people from all over the world practicing Buddhism seriously. They have come and hearing some discourses and all that. And we understand from the from the parampara knowledge, it is Lord Himself who came as Buddha. Right? And He gave a certain knowledge. But actually that knowledge was, is not the highest knowledge. It was a knowledge that was essential for that particular circumstance. Because people had, were completely misled. And they were not following the real principles of the Vedas. They were completely misled. And so at that time, Buddha came and He had to teach a certain aspect. Because spiritual learning is a very vast learning. And any learning requires qualification. If one does not have the qualification, you cannot learn higher things. Just like if you want in our modern day, if you want to do law, you must be a graduate. And after you have done your graduation, then you can go for law. That's the system. Because you cannot appreciate. Legal things are all very complex. A young mind cannot understand that. One has to grow up a little bit and mature, and then can understand legal complications, why law exists, and all of those kind of things. So in the same way, spiritual knowledge also, there is gradation, and there are very advanced aspects of spiritual understanding. And if you have to understand higher and higher aspects of spiritual understanding, it requires higher qualifications. And the whole Vedic program is to gradually build that qualification in the human society, over many lifetimes, even if it takes many lifetimes. So not understanding all of these things, there was an occasion, there was a situation in our country, in our world, when people had misunderstood. And so at that time, Lord Buddha appeared. Nindasi Yajnavidera Shruti Jatam Shruti Jatam Yajnava Nindasi and he condemned, he rejected. Why? Sadaya Hrudaya Pashugatam Out of sadaya, daya, feeling great compassion for Pashugatam, for the killing of the animals. Animals were being killed, not understanding the real purpose, and why they were killing animals? And when they were questioned, they said Shruti Jatam Yajnava It is the Yajna according to the given in the Shruti, in the Vedic literatures. So they were citing their example. So Buddha said, Nindasi Yajnavidera Shruti Jatam. So it was a temporary arrangement. And then after Buddha, we understand came Shankaracharya. He set right several things. And then came many other Acharyas. So like that, the whole, there was a gradual, and progressive, development of the spiritual thought, spiritual understanding, and that reached its pinnacle, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came, Krishna himself came, and gave this knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada has given that highest knowledge, in an easily understandable way, and we have come in touch with that."
**Summary:** The speaker traces the history of spiritual knowledge propagation through various Acharyas, emphasizing Srila Prabhupada's contribution in making the highest knowledge accessible and the importance of viewing life through the prism of transcendental knowledge.

But then, after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu left, one or two generations after that, two or three generations after that, again Chaitanya's knowledge, Chaitanya's understanding, what he had taught, was also misunderstood. And again there were Acharyas like Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who had to come and restore that. And then Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, continued the work, and then Srila Prabhupada. So if you see the whole, if you trace this history, last five thousand years, history of spiritual development, or spiritual knowledge propagation, in the last five thousand years of Kali Yuga, it has gone through ups and downs, and how it has been gradually elevated. And then, Srila Prabhupada has given that highest knowledge, in an easily understandable way, and we have come in touch with that. Being in the material world, a place which is actually meant for all those who are not law abiding, conditioned souls, a place where cursed people from the spiritual world are sent here. And for us, we have come in contact with this knowledge. And we are able to, and so, when, if we want to have an understanding of anything in this world, about our lives, what should be or how we should act in our life, we should see from the, through the prism of transcendental knowledge, given by Srila Prabhupada. Then we will understand things properly, in proper perspective. And, the proper understanding is that this is a great calamity, there is nothing but great calamity at this moment. But things can be greatly benefited, can be changed, by injecting Krishna consciousness. This was the understanding that Srila Prabhupada always had. This was the spirit of how to look at this material world.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Brahma gives in the Bhagavatam, a formula, which, we will never go wrong, with our words, we will never go wrong, with our mind, we will never go wrong, with our senses."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how to avoid mistakes in the material world by controlling our words, mind, and senses through constant devotion to the lotus feet of Hari, following the example of residents of the spiritual world.

And in the material world, we generally act through three things, according to Vedic understanding: by our words, we act. Right? By words we interact in this world, with our mind, and with our senses. And, sometimes, we have all experienced, sometimes we say something and things go wrong, in our relationship, or something happens. And we hurt somebody, and then after that we regret, oh my god, my words were not, I shouldn't have spoken like that. Or some emotions, or some thinking, through our mind also, we may sometimes make a mistake. But we act. And then, or through our senses, we act, knowledge acquiring and active senses. We act, and then we regret, oh I made a mistake, I shouldn't have done that. Right? These are the three ways by which we interact in this material world. And we can make mistakes in this. So, Lord Brahma gives in the Bhagavatam, a formula, which we will never go wrong with our words, we will never go wrong with our mind, we will never go wrong with our senses. And he says, if we follow this, we will be very safe. What is that? na bhārati meṅga mṛśopalakṣyate na bhārati meṅga mṛśopalakṣyate. Bhārati means untruth, or false, or a wrong path. Bhārati, Bhārati, generally refers to Mother Saraswati, right? But in studying Vedic literatures, we must see the context and understand. Here the word Bhārati means one's words. na bhārati meṅga mṛśopalakṣyate. Lord Brahma is saying this to Narada Muni, "My dear, my words never fail. My words never go wrong. My mind never goes into a... My senses will never go astray. How am I ensuring that?" That is by... Here the word used by the... In this verse... Because in my heart... Utkanta means similar sense as... With great anxiety... With great fervor... I am constantly holding on to the lotus feet of Hari. If we hold on to the lotus feet of Hari, with great eagerness, with great zeal... Prabhupada translates that word Utkanta. Utkanta is connected to the word Vaikunta. Vaikunta means free from anxiety. Utkanta means with full... Not exactly anxiety... With full zeal... With a great deal of fervor I am holding on constantly to the lotus feet of Hari in my heart. But because of that... So this is the formula that Lord Brahma is giving, that how we can ensure in our life our words, our mind and our senses don't go astray. And that is by holding on firmly to the lotus feet of Hari all the time. Holding on to the lotus feet of Hari means always living by Harer Anucharaha. In the spiritual world, the residents are all Harer Anucharaha. They're always Anucharaha. They're constantly following the directions of Hari. That is the position of the pure living entity in the spiritual world. So by doing that, even in this material world, which is great calamity around us, we can be very safe. This is the instruction of the Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "In Bhagavad Gita, the Lord declares that his devotees cannot be vanquished at any time."
**Summary:** The Lord intervenes to prevent harm to his devotees, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita.

In Bhagavad Gita, the Lord declares that his devotees cannot be vanquished at any time. The Lord could understand that the quarrel between the doorman and the sages was taking a different turn. And therefore, he instantly came out of his place and went to the spot to stop further aggravation so that his devotees, the doorman, might not be vanquished for good. Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport.

**Key Quote:** "So, the Lord arrived there."
**Summary:** The lecture begins to explain the Srimad Bhagavatam verse about the doormen, the sages, and the Lord's arrival.

We are reading in the Srimad Bhagavatam, in this part, about the two doormen stopping the sages. And the sages becoming angry, and we just saw in the previous verses, they cursed that they should go down to the earthly planet. And we also saw that the two doormen very graciously accepted the curse that was delivered to them. And in today's verse, we are seeing how the Lord responded when he was aware that this was going on at the seventh gate of his Vaikuntha. evam tadhaiva bhagavan aravindha nabhah svanam vibhudhya sadatikramam arya hridyah tasmin yayo. He arrived there. evam in this way. Thus, tadhaiva bhagavan. At that moment, the Lord appeared there. And the Lord appeared there how? Sahashrihi, along with Lakshmi. So, this verse talks about the Lord at that moment arriving at the scene where the sages and the doormen and all of this cursing and humbly accepting and the sages being angry, all of this is going on. As Prabhupada mentions here, the Lord did not want further aggravation and something more should not happen to his devotees, the doormen. So, the Lord arrived there.

And so here, the svanam sadatikramam vibhudhya. Svanam, his own servants, sadatikramam, they had, atikramam, they had committed an offense. They had gone beyond what they should do. Atikramam towards whom? Sadatikramam towards the great sages, the four sages. Sadatikramam, svanam sadatikramam vibhudhya. The Lord became aware of that. And immediately, the Lord tasmin yaya. And how did he go there? Charanau chalayan yaya. With his own feet, he arrived there. Sahashrihi, along with Laxmidevi. Now, what is the Lord's lotus feet like? There is an interesting adjective here: Paramahamsa mahamuninam anmeshaniya charanau. Anmeshana means to search out or to seek after that lotus feet. So, the lotus feet which are sought after by whom? Mahamuninam, Paramahamsa mahamuninam. Paramahamsa means the most elevated transcendentalists. And mahamuninam, and very, very great sages, transcendentalists, great sages, they seek out that lotus feet. Anmeshaniya charanau chalayan sahashrihi. Walking on those lotus feet, which is sought after by the great transcendentalists and the great sages, the Lord arrived there.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord who is the delight of the righteous."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the verse, focusing on the Lord's qualities as Aravindanabha and Arya Hridyaha.

And another expression that is used here is Arya Hridyaha. The Lord who is Arya Hridyaha, the Lord who is Aravindanabha, Bhagavan Aravindanabha, one who has a lotus in his navel, referring to the Garbhakshayi Vishnu, and from the lotus sprouts, from his navel sprouts the lotus on which Lord Brahma is situated and all the lokas are in the stem of the lotus, so he is known as Aravindanabha. And here he is also described as Arya Hridyaha. Arya, righteous, Prabhupada has used that word, Hridyaha, the delight of one who is attracted to. So, Arya Hridyaha, the Lord who is the delight of the righteous, who is Aravindanabha, and whose lotus feet are sought after by Paramahamsa Mahamuninam Anveshaniya Charanah Chalayan Sahashrihi along with Lakshmi Devi, he arrived there. At that very moment, Tadaiyava, the Lord who is called Padmanabha, Bhagavan Aravindanabha, because of the lotus grown from his navel, and who is the delight of the righteous, Arya Hridyaha, learnt about the insult, Vibhudhya, Sadatikramam, learnt about the insult offered by his own servants, Svanam, to the saints, accompanied by his spouse, the Goddess of Fortune, Sahashrihi. He went to the spot, Yayav, Tasmin Yayav, on those very feet, Charanah, sought after, sought for by the recluses and great sages. Paramahamsa Mahamuninam Anveshaniya Charanah Chalayan Sahashrihi. So, very beautiful verse.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Lord's concern for his devotees and contrasts the Vedic concept of a civilized person (Arya) with the modern materialistic view.

Describing how the Lord is so concerned about his devotees and what was happening in the Vaikuntha, and he personally arrived there immediately along with Lakshmi Devi. So, there are some very interesting points here from the verse. The Lord here is described as Arya Hridyaha, the delight of the righteous. This word Arya Prabhupada also describes in other places. Arya refers to a civilized person. Aryan refers to civilized. In the Bhagavad Gita when this word comes up in the second chapter, Prabhupada explains the word Arya is one who knows the progressive values of life. So, human life is meant for progressing in values in understanding, and one who is conscious of this, that human life we can achieve something which is very special which is not possible in other living entities. So, human life and human consciousness is very special and so we must attain that higher understanding. One who is conscious of this, they are called Aryans, one who is conscious of the progressive values of life.

**Key Quote:** "A person has to be judged by his tastes."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that true civilization is defined by refined consciousness and elevated tastes, not just external appearances.

Unlike in today's world, you see who is called a civilized man? A man who is wearing a nice suit and a tie and a boot and going in a big car and living in a big house, and these kind of things, he is considered to be a very civilized man. That is what is thought of. But actually in the Vedic culture, it is not just your attire. So, somebody may be in those kind of a very polished attire, but in his consciousness may have some other kind of a very lowly understanding. So, that is not important. What is important is Arya Hridyaha, and so the yardstick, the test that is used here, what Srila Prabhupada is setting forth is Arya Hridyaha, a person has to be judged by his tastes. What are his tastes? What is he attracted to? What is he, what delights him? You see. So, Arya Hridyaha means those who are very civilized, who know the progressive values of life, who have a refined consciousness, who have actually refined their consciousness, and how do we know they have refined their consciousness? Because their tastes have changed. That is the test. What is it that delights them? What is it that they are attracted to? What is it that they go after? So, that is an indication of the level of consciousness of the person.

**Key Quote:** "They are attracted to the transcendental Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that evolved individuals are attracted to the transcendental Lord, highlighting the Lord's position as the source of everything.

So, Arya refers not simply external dressing and those kind of things, but somebody who is evolved in his consciousness, and hence his likes, what engages him, what attracts him, those objects have changed and they are not some lowly material objects of this world, but the highest level of consciousness, they are attracted to the transcendental Lord. And so, the Lord is known as Arya Hridyaha. In that sense, Arya Hridyaha means those Lord who is the delight of the most civilized people. So, the Lord is the delight of the most civilized people, most enlightened people. That is why Krishna says itimatva bhajante maam budha bhavasamanvitah. They are enlightened, Buddha, and they are bhavasamanvitah, their heart is filled with bhava for the Lord because they are enlightened and they know who is the Lord, what is Krishna's position, He is the source of everything. So, this is the position of the Lord and there is another expression

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Shukadeva Goswami is charmed by Hari's transcendental qualities and his mathihi his consciousness is charmed by the transcendental qualities of Hari."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Shukadeva Goswami's attraction to the Lord's qualities with the superficiality of modern society, emphasizing the deeper understanding of an evolved person in Vedic culture.

in the Bhagavatam, a very interesting expression about Shukadeva Goswami, who is the speaker, great celebrated speaker of the Srimad Bhagavatam, and Bhagavatam when it is introducing Shukadeva Goswami, Bhagavatam says Shukadeva was harer gunaakshiptha mathihi. harer gunaakshiptha, akshiptha is a similar word like hridyaha, aarya hridyaha, akshiptha means charmed by, what is it that is, what is it that he is charmed by, and it is said that Shukadeva Goswami is charmed by harer guna, Hari's transcendental qualities and his mathihi, his consciousness is charmed by the transcendental qualities of Hari, so harer gunaakshiptha mathihi. So, we can see the contrast in modern society, we have people, they are just dressed up very well, but their consciousness, their tastes are actually very, very ordinary, they are attracted to women, they are attracted to some material sense gratification, they are full of greed and jealousy and all of those things, so those things are manifest, that is what is there in their heart, but externally they are dressed up very well and they appear like great civilized gentlemen. So, we can see the yardstick in the Vedic culture, such a much more deep understanding of a person who is an evolved person, and according to the evolution of the person, his tastes will differ, what he is attracted to will differ, you see in the 17th chapter

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "According to the level of development of consciousness we are attracted to different things."
**Summary:** The speaker references Bhagavad Gita chapter 17 to illustrate how different modes of nature influence our faith, understanding, and attraction to different types of food, reflecting our level of consciousness.

which we are chanting in the morning, Bhagavad Gita, Krishna also talks about the different kinds of Shraddha, the chapter is called divisions of faith based on the three modes of material nature, so Krishna talks about how according to the modes of material nature we are influenced, we have different kinds of faith, we have different kinds of understanding, and when it comes to food, Krishna talks about this is what they are attracted to, so people who are in the mode of ignorance, tamasa, tamasika, they are attracted to one kind of food because that is their nature, that is their consciousness is affected in that way, if they are in rajoguna, they are attracted to some, if they are in satvaguna, they are attracted to some other kind of food, if they are in mode of transcendence above all the three modes, they are attracted to something else. So, this is the important point, according to the level of development of consciousness we are attracted to different things, and what we are attracted to, from that you can conclude what is the level of the consciousness.

**Summary:** The speaker shares a story about Prabhupada discussing a popular Ramayana edition and emphasizing that true spiritual literature should bring readers to the spiritual platform.

So, arya hridyaha and similarly this another word paramahamsa mahamuninam anveshaniyacharanam, what are the paramahamsas and mahamunis, what are they seeking, what is it that they are looking for, that lotus feet of the lord, anveshaniyacharanam. So, this is the important thing, there was one conversation with Shila Prabhupada and some devotees brought up, some Indian guests brought up the discussion about one very popular edition of a Ramayan which is very well known in our country, and then they brought up that book and the discussion about that, and then Prabhupada started discussing, telling about that author and that how the author does not come in a proper parampara and is understanding his mixed with mayavada understanding, impersonal understanding, although he has written on Ramayana and so on, and then when the discussion went on, at one point Prabhupada brings out something very interesting, he says by reading that book, I have not come across one person who has come to the spiritual platform, not a single person has come to the spiritual platform. So, this is the intent of the original Vedic literatures or for that matter any spiritual literature, it is meant to bring the reader to the spiritual platform, it is a very wonderful test that Prabhupada sets out.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the criteria for judging spiritual literature, emphasizing its ability to bring readers to a liberated state where their tastes are transformed and they are delighted by Krishna.

And if there is a literature and we want to judge that literature, we have to see if that literature is able to bring the readers and the followers of that literature to a spiritual platform. So, spiritual platform means the brahmabhuta platform, it means the liberated platform, and once you are on that liberated platform, your tastes will be different, you are charmed by different things, you are delighted by different things, and what are you delighted? The most exalted spiritualists, they are delighted by Lord Shri Krishna, his personality, his name, his form, his service, his pastimes, remembering them and chanting about the Lord's pastimes, chanting the Lord's holy name, this is what delights them.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the transformative power of Prabhupada's books with a news article about Pope John Paul II, setting the stage for a discussion about the contrast between worldly and spiritual tastes.

So, this is the important point that Prabhupada brings out that a literature has supposed to bring about the readers to the transcendental platform. We see that happening with Shri Prabhupada's books and the Gita and the Bhagavata, when we read these books, it brings about the change in the heart of people, we are inspired that yes, this is the goal of life, this is what we should be doing, not that we should be running after sense gratification like cats and dogs do, running after the senses. So, there was another news article just a few days before BBC released a documentary film and there was a news about that, the news is about Pope John Paul the second, he was the Pope, the Vatican, the head of the Catholic Church and he was the head for about 27 years.

**Key Quote:** "Look at his tastes, what are his tastes and what is he attracted to."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the controversy surrounding Pope John Paul II's letters to a married woman, questioning his tastes and attractions in light of his status as a saint.

And he was, and then they have somehow come to know, the BBC filmmakers got access to some about 350 letters that he wrote to one married woman over 30 years, and those letters reveal an intense friendship that he had with her which lasted for 30 years, and then they have analyzed the letters that some of the letters become intimate and so on, and so it goes on like that, and after about few years after he died in some time and then after his death he was also declared, they have a process, the Vatican church has a process and by which they declared him to be a saint also. So, we see on the one hand this is, he is considered to be a saint, a Pope for so many decades and look at his tastes, what are his tastes and what is he attracted to, and then it also says that how he went on a skiing holiday, he went on a camp and he went on a so on and so on with that married woman and so on, all those kind of things. So, we can see that by these kind of things and of course Srila Prabhupada made the very, very strong objection about all of them eating meat, so they are eating meat, they are having these kind of understanding and all of, so these are the things that delight them.

**Summary:** The speaker shares an anecdote about priests at a seminary who are allowed to watch movies and drink alcohol on weekends, contrasting this with Prabhupada's standard of reaching the spiritual platform through religious practice.

I remember once not very far from our temple here, there is one seminary and I had an encounter with some of the priests of that seminary, then when I was talking to them, they said that over the weekend they are allowed to go out of the seminary and go to a cinema, you can go and watch a cinema that is allowed, but in the seminary they should not watch anything, they should be very strict, and then they also said that in the seminary when they are in the seminary they have to be very strict, they cannot drink alcohol, but over the weekend when they are outside they can take a little bit of alcohol. So, this is the kind of thing, so you can see what there, what is the, in today's world, what is the understanding of spirituality and look at the standard that Srila Prabhupada sets, it should bring, one, one should come to the spiritual platform, Brahmabhuta platform, by the practice of religion, by the practice of spirituality, we should come to the Brahmabhuta platform, to the spiritual platform.

**Key Quote:** "Rasopyasya paramdrishtva nivartante."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the verse 'niraharasya dehinam' from the Bhagavad Gita, explaining the difference between abstaining from sense objects and achieving complete detachment through transcendental experience (paramdrishtva).

It's a very interesting verse, the verse talks about two things: niraharasya dehinam. One meaning of the word nirahara means not eating food, ahara nirahara, so not eating food, but here niraharasya refers to negative restricting principles, negative principles, don't do this, don't do this. vishaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinam rasavarjam rasopyasya. Here the niraharasya dehinam, one who is abstaining, following all of these negative restrictions, niraharasya dehinam, dehinam, a person who has an embodied person, a living entity, niraharasya dehinam vishaya vinivartante rasavarjam. vishaya vinivartante means he is abstaining from the vishayas, that's what the meaning of niraharasya, he is not supplying the vishaya. vishaya refers to indriyavishaya, so he is abstaining from vishaya, vishaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinam rasavarjam, only vishaya vinivartante rasavarjam, vishaya meaning rasa other than rasa, rasavarjam means apart from the sense of enjoyment, in other words the sense of enjoyment is still there, so he may be niraharasya dehinam vishaya vinivartante, but rasavarjam vishaya vinivartante, he is still attracted to that rasa for enjoying the vishaya is there, other than that, other than that he is abstaining from the vishaya, but rasopyasya paramdrishtva, what is that paramdrishtva nivartante, but when you do paramdrishtva, when you have the transcendental experience, raso api nivartante, even the desire, even the sense of enjoyment goes away. So, it is not that he is only abstaining strictly on the basis of certain principles that no I must not, one he has, one who has developed paramdrishtva rasopyasya paramdrishtva nivartante, so the first point in this verse is

vishaya vinivartante niraharasya dehina rasavarjam, this is the first point, he is niraharasya dehina, abstaining from vishaya and but his desire for enjoying the senses may still remain, but rasopyasya paramdrishtva nivartante, one who is paramdrishtva, one who has had the transcendental experience, even the taste goes away, that is the important thing. So here we see arya hridyaha, so in other words they are naturally drawn to the Lord. This is an indication, this is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu talks about, after sadhana bhakti one comes to the stage of a spontaneous devotion, one is drawn to Krishna, drawn to serving Krishna, chanting the holy names, hearing about Krishna, remembering Krishna, so that is the stage that one can come to. So, this is a great revelation by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, otherwise religion is considered simply to be a set of rules and following the rituals and doing this, doing that and all of those things, but no, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches that all of that is meant to change your heart and you should become arya hridyaha, you are delighted by Krishna, you are drawn to Krishna, you are charmed by Krishna's qualities, that is the stage one should aspire to come to.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the descriptions in the Bhagavatam are actual transcendental accounts of events in the spiritual world, as taught by the acharyas.

And here we see directly there is a mention in these kind of descriptions in the Bhagavatam that the Lord arrived there sahashrihi along with his consort, spouse, Prabhupada has used the word along with his consort, Sri Lakshmi Devi, so the Lord and Lakshmi both arrived there in the spiritual, in this particular place. So, we understand as the acharyas have described, have taught that these are all actual transcendental descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord, what happened in the spiritual world and we have to take this as it is.

**Key Quote:** "What kind of consciousness you have at the time of death decides the next body."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the trivialization of Vedic stories as myths by modern thinkers and Mayavadis, referencing the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize the importance of consciousness at the time of death.

Unfortunately in modern times we come across people who don't have this understanding and even the mayavadis have joined that kind of an understanding and they trivialize all of these things as no no these are all just mythical stories, these are fictitious stories, this is just a fiction, these are just not true stories, but that is not the way acharyas have described, like in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna is telling in the eighth chapter that we must always think of him, right? tasmat sarveshu kaleshu mam anusmaram yudhya ca mayarpitam anuva buddhir mam eva yasyasi asamsyeh and Krishna says that in what context, because Arjuna has asked the question what happens to, what state, what state one will attain after he leaves this body, so for that Krishna has said that what state of consciousness one has at the time of death determines the next body and then after saying that Krishna is saying therefore yamyam vapi smaran bhavam tyajatyante kalevaram, so what kind of consciousness you have at the time of death decides the next body and therefore tasmat sarveshu kaleshu mam anusmaram therefore think of me always and fight.

**Key Quote:** "You should think of me as one who has achintya roopam."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's instructions in the Bhagavad Gita on how to remember Him, emphasizing His inconceivable form (achintya roopam) and transcendental nature (tamasah parastat).

Now soon after that Krishna explains how we should think of him, it's a very nice instruction by Krishna, he says kavim puranam anushasitaram anoraniyam anoraniyamsam anusmaret yaha, so he says sarvasya dataram achintya roopam, very clearly Krishna is saying you should think of me as one who has achintya roopam aditya varnam tamasa parastat and his achintya roopa, this is how we should think of him, kavim puranam anushasitaram kavim, he is the most learned one who knows everything, the Lord is the knower of everything, kavim puranam he is primeval, most ancient, anushasitaram everything is under his anushasana, he is the giver of the rules, everything is under his control, kavim puranam anushasitaram anoraniyamsam and he is smaller than the smallest, the soul is considered to be very small, very fine and Krishna is so fine he can enter even the finest soul anoraniyamsam anusmaredhya in this way one should remember me, sarvasya dataram one who is the giver, one who is the maintainer of everyone, achintya roopam one who has got an inconceivable form, he has a form but that form is not conceivable by our material senses, he has a different kind of a spiritual form aditya varanam and his form is always luminous never in ignorance tamasah parastat he is parastat he is transcendental to this reality, this reality is called tamasah reality, dark reality because in this world everything is dark because of the sun, because of the light bulbs we have light otherwise this goes back to a dark state that is why this world is considered to be dark because of the sun this world is considered tamasah parastat and he is transcendental to that. So, very clearly in the Vedic literature this is, this aditya varanam tamasah parastat is a statement that comes in the Rigveda, is a statement that comes in the Shvetashvatar Upanishad.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the transcendental reality described in Vedic literature cannot be accessed through material senses or intellect, requiring spiritual learning and faith.

Many other Upanishads in the Bhagavad Gita, so again and again Vedic literatures have described that his position is transcendental, cannot be accessed by these materials, the material senses and the material mind and intelligence, you need another kind of a spiritual learning then you will be able to access that, then you will be able to experience param drishtva, you will be able to see, you will be able to experience that transcendental reality, there is a process one has to go through that process, by that process you can have access to that higher reality and so all of this is described, but still the mayavadis along with the other materialistic people who don't have faith in the Vedic literatures, they say all of this is myth, these are not to be taken seriously, if at all it has got some message, some good message you can take that, so that is why people think that

educated people, intelligent people, they think that these are all just some entertaining stories and if you check the mayavadis even they will think in the same way, yes these are all some, it has a message and it has got no reality, but this is not the way acharyas have presented, this has a transcendental vedhyam vastu matra vastu vedhyam vastava matra vastu shivadam, this Bhagavatam is teaching us the reality, ultimate reality, vastu vedhyam, it enables us to understand the ultimate reality and that ultimate reality is a transcendental reality, not seen, not accessible to the material senses. So, these pastimes of the Lord have to be taken as it is and as it is given by the scriptures and as it is given by the acharyas and not be confused by these modern interpretations and the mayavadis interpretations. We will stop here grantharaj shivad bhagavatam ki sila pravupad ki.

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord cannot be seen by ordinary eyes But he now became visible to the eyesight of the Kumaras"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Supreme Lord is not visible to ordinary eyes but became visible to the Kumaras due to their devotion and meditation.

In this verse we find the word Achakshat Akshavishayam. The Supreme Lord cannot be seen by ordinary eyes, but he now became visible to the eyesight of the Kumaras. Another significant word is Samadhi Bhagyam. Meditators who are very fortunate can see the Vishnu form of the Lord within their hearts by following the yogic process, but to see him face to face is a different matter. This is only possible for pure devotees. The Kumaras, therefore, upon seeing the Lord coming forward with his associates, who were holding an umbrella and a chamara fan, were struck with wonder, and they were seeing the Lord face to face.

**Key Quote:** "That devotees being elevated in love of God Always see Shama Sundara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Within their hearts But when they are mature The same God is visible before them face to face"
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how devotees, through love of God and devotional service, can see the Lord within their hearts and eventually face to face.

It is said in the Brahma Samhita that devotees, being elevated in love of God, always see Shama Sundara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, within their hearts. But when they are mature, the same God is visible before them face to face. For ordinary persons, the Lord is not visible. However, when one can understand the significance of his holy name, and one engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, beginning with the tongue by chanting and tasting Prasad, then gradually the Lord reveals himself. Thus the devotee constantly sees the Lord within his heart, and in a more mature stage, one can see the same Lord directly, as we can see everything else.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of the President of India visiting their temple, highlighting the extensive preparations and the large entourage that accompanied him.

Some years ago, we had a president of India visiting our temple here, and we had gone and invited him in Delhi, and then he agreed to come, and when he came, there were a lot of preparations made, and security personnel, protocol officers, they would advise us how to, what he should do, etc. And finally when he came, he didn't come alone. There was a motorcade of 24 cars all over on Hare Krishna hill. By the time the long motorcade came, and he got off, and there were a few cars before, and a few cars behind him, and all of them stood, the next two hours or so that he was there, all these cars were parked on the road, and all big cars, and big officials, like that. And when the president of India comes, it is a protocol that the chief minister, or the chief minister himself must come, the governor must come from the state. So all of them were there. So it's not a small thing when the president comes. And quite recently we had president of India coming to our temple in Vrindavan, which is far away. And there when he came, three helicopters landed. And so we were all waiting there and receiving, to receive him. First the governor's helicopter came from Lucknow. So that was another one. And then these three, Indian Air Force helicopters, massive helicopters. And they all landed there. So, when we see in this material world, a big person coming, it's marked with his entourage, and all of these kind of manifestations of his power and position.

And that's natural. And so here we see, when the Lord is appearing, naturally, and he also has his associates and entourage, all of them appear, and it's a grand appearance. Long ago, I had, I remember one interaction with a doctor. I had fallen sick, not very sick, some extent sick. And I had gone to a doctor. And this doctor was very friendly, very, very, he talks a lot with, he engages in a conversation with the patients. That's his one of his techniques, and puts them in comfort, and talks to them nicely. So he started talking to me, and he saw me because I was a devotee. Then he started asking, I can't remember the exact subject that we discussed. Something I mentioned about Krishna, Radharani, Lakshmi, Vishnu, and something like that. When you should please Lakshmi, then Narayana will be pleased. You please Radharani, Krishna will be, something like that we were talking. And then he heard all that and he said, very interesting. All of these are anthropomorphic concepts.

**Key Quote:** "Some people think and say, that our human ideas, we are imposing on, God. So this is called, anthropomorphic concepts."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the idea that some people believe religious concepts are human ideas imposed on God, dismissing them as mythology.

Meaning, he was saying that anthropomorphic means having human attributes. Like here we see, we have experience, if you want to get the check from a big man, our devotees often do. They go and please his wife. And when the wife is pleased, there is a good possibility you will get the check. So these kind of things are human experiences. And so some people think and say that our human ideas, we are imposing on God. So this is called anthropomorphic concepts. So this is what he was trying to say. And of course, I don't remember what I said, maybe I was not well enough to answer this kind of a question. So anyway, so people think that these are all ideas that have come from human society, now we are mapping on to the spiritual domain. And this is a kind of a human creation. Basically, it's an idea that it's a human creation. So that's how some people think. And the Mayavadis also have a similar idea. And they say that these are all just stories. Vishnu, Vishnu having four arms. Okay, here we have a human experience of two arms. And for the, because he is God after all, he should have something more than us, and let's give him four hands. You know, these kind of ideas. So these are all just mythology.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the anthropomorphic view with the traditional understanding of Acharyas, who do not dismiss these concepts as mere mythology.

They dismiss it like that. And they think that you should see some ideas, some good message behind that, that you must appreciate. So how do Acharyas explain this? If you study, none of the Acharyas, including Mayavadi Acharyas, will say like this, especially the Vaishnava Acharyas. They never derided these as mythological stories, a human idea carried forward to a spiritual realm. This is not the kind of an expression. No Acharya has ever said these things. Even Shankaracharya, he said, Narayano Paro Vyaktad. He said, yes, Narayana's existence, Para, is transcendental. So none of the Acharyas have said these things. And Srila Prabhupada, also following this, the line of the Acharyas, Srila Prabhupada, none of our Acharyas in our Sampradaya, none of them have said that these are all mythological, imaginary, some human idea imposed on divinity.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's perspective that Krishna is not accessible to the mundane senses and is transcendental.

This is not the understanding. How does Srila Prabhupada explain this? Srila Prabhupada, like here it is explained in this verse. He is, Desa, Achakshata, Akshavishayam. Vishnu is not Akshavishayam. He is not a Indriyavishaya. But here, Achakshata, Akshavishayam, he, they began to see him. So, Vishnu's position, Krishna's position is, he is not Akshavishaya, he is not a Indriyavishaya. He is not seen, he cannot be accessed by our senses. This is again and again explained in the Vedic literature, Athashree Krishnanamadhi, Nabhavet Grahya Mindriyaihi. Indriyagrahya Nabhavet. Senses cannot access him. He is beyond the senses. He is beyond sense perception. This is what the Vedic literatures have often explained about Krishna's position. And Srila Prabhupada also says that, Yes, Vishnu or Krishna, he is transcendental. He is beyond material sense perception. He is not the subject matter of the mundane senses. And he is beyond the range of human sense, and mental and intellectual conceptions.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's reality, the reality of Krishna or Vishnu, is inaccessible, to our mundane senses. Our mundane senses can only access, a certain amount of reality."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna's reality is beyond the reach of our limited mundane senses, which can only perceive a fraction of reality.

This is the understanding. This understanding is presented throughout in the Vedic literatures. And Srila Prabhupada also says the same thing. He is, Krishna's reality, the reality of Krishna or Vishnu, is inaccessible to our mundane senses. Our mundane senses can only access a certain amount of reality. Not even all of the material reality. Right? Our senses cannot understand. Our eyes cannot see the mind and intelligence. But we know people have mind intelligence, and they are working, and it is working. We can see the effects of the mind and intelligence, although we cannot see the mind and intelligence. So our senses have limitation. Even our mind and intelligence has limitation, what they can access in this reality, as material reality. So there is a certain reality beyond what is accessible to the mind, senses and intelligence. And Krishna or Vishnu belongs to that higher reality. So our senses don't have the powers to access that realm of reality.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a mobile phone unable to make international calls to illustrate that the limitations of our instruments do not negate the existence of a higher reality.

That is the important point. Just like suppose you have a mobile phone. And your mobile phone, you don't have international, you only have facility to make local calls, India calls. You can't make any call outside of India. And somebody comes and tells you, I have a friend in America, and this is the number of my friend. And you use your phone and try to call that number. It's an American number. Call will not go through. You try many times, it will not go through. Now somebody may say, no, no, you charge properly, then it may go through. You can have charge many times, still it will not go through. Somebody may say, no, no, you change your phone version, get a upgrade, a better phone. You can get a better phone, still you try, it will not go through. Go to a place where there is very good signal, and try. You can do anything you want, anything you want, you will not get the call. Then can you say, see, I have tried so much. I don't think you have a friend in America. Or even better, I don't think there is something called America. Because if there is, I must be able to make a phone call and talk. No, it is not so. Just because our phone, our instruments, cannot reach out, we cannot say such a reality does not exist.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the spiritual reality is beyond the reach of our senses, but there is a process to perceive the Lord, such as through samadhi.

This is the principle that is used by the Acharyas, by Srila Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada gave very contemporary articulation of this idea, that this reality, this spiritual reality is beyond the access, beyond the powers of our senses. This is the perception, this is the perspective that is presented in the Vedic literature. Now, if this is the reality, how do we ever know that reality? Is there a way to know that reality? Yes. Although the senses cannot perceive, atha shri krishna naam aadhi na bhaved grahyam indriyaihi sevon mukho hi jihvadau svayam eva sphurathi adaha. This is the way, this is the method that is given in the Vedic literatures, how to perceive the transcendental reality. And here in this verse, in today's verse, also it is described, that he is, he became akshavishayam, although he is not akshavishayam, he is adhokshaja. Adhokshaja means not accessible to the senses. Because, and he was samadhi bhagyam, sva-samadhi bhagyam. Lord is seen in samadhi, in trance. This is the idea. The senses ordinarily cannot perceive, but there is a process. If we follow that process, then we will be able to perceive the Lord in samadhi.

There are many verses in the Bhagavatam, one of them is the verse spoken by Shukadeva Goswami in his prayers, which we used to chant, or we chant sometimes, yadangri abhidhyana samadhi dhautaya dhiyanupasyanti hi tatvam atmanah samadhi dhautaya anupasyanti dhiyanupasyanti. In the Vedic literatures, like in this verse in the Bhagavatam, it is describing how anupasyanti, pasyanti means to see. The Vedic literatures talks about tatva darshi vihi, those who have seen the truth. They are seeing the truth. So there is a way to see that truth. How to see the truth? yadangri abhidhyana samadhi dhautaya dhiyanupasyanti hi tatvam atmanah atmanah tatvam Atma here refers to Paramatma. Vishnu. Vishnu Tatva. So tatvam atmanah tatvam anupasyanti How one can see that? yadangri abhidhyana samadhi dhautaya Angri means the lotus feet of the Lord. Angri. yadangri abhidhyana When one does abhidhyana of Angri, the lotus feet of the Lord, and becomes mature, samadhi, reaches samadhi, fully absorbed in the lotus meditation of the lotus feet of the Lord, and by such meditation, dhauti, yadangri abhidhyana samadhi dhautaya dhautaya, dhauti means to become purified. And when one's intelligence is purified, samadhi dhautaya dhia dhautaya dhia When one's intelligence is purified, then, anupasyanti hi tatvam atmanah This is the way one can perceive

**Key Quote:** "Most people don't take the trouble of actually following the process, purifying the senses, purifying their consciousness by intense meditation, absorption on the lotus feet of the Lord. And hence they don't have a perception of the truth."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that most people don't achieve true realization due to a lack of dedication and instead rely on mental speculation, contrasting this with the Hamsa Guhyas prayers.

the transcendental reality. And then, in this verse, Shukadeva Goswami says, vadanti chaita kavayaya tharucham. And most people don't have this, come to this realization. Most people don't take the trouble of actually following the process, purifying the senses, purifying their consciousness by intense meditation, absorption on the lotus feet of the Lord. And hence they don't have a perception of the truth. But they still talk about the truth, and they talk in their own way, without proper understanding. That is why innumerable ideas and opinions have come about in this world about God. Those who have seen God, truly experienced God, they have one understanding, all the bona fide acharyas. So, vadanti chaita etat vadanti yatharucham vadanti kavayo As they want, their own opinions, they talk. But the Lord can be perceived in this way, same mukundo bhagavan prasidatam May that Lord Mukunda be pleased with me, and reveal His true nature. That's the prayer of Shukadeva Goswami. So, Lord can be, like it is explained here, samadhi bhagyam. They were seeing the Lord in their samadhi. And now, He became akshavishayam. They were able to see Him. In another place in the Bhagavatam, which we also chant, we used to chant, probably we chant occasionally, called the hamsa guhyas prayers in the Bhagavatam,

**Key Quote:** "Only ones whose heart has become completely pure, such people, can be experienced, that Lord, when one is in a state of complete purity, one will be able to experience the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Hamsa Guhyas prayers and emphasizes that only those with pure hearts, in a state of complete absorption, can experience the Lord.

a similar idea is described. Hamsa guhyas prayers were actually spoken by Prajapati Daksha. And generally, Daksha is not considered to be a very exalted person. Of course, he is one, in one sense in the material domain, considered an exalted person because he serves the Lord in his mission of creation of this material world, and populating the world. But still, his prayers are considered very special, and it has become part of the Bhagavatam, because Bhagavatam explains that he did not compose those prayers himself. Already those prayers were there in the Vedic literatures since time immemorial. And so those prayers, which were already present in the Vedic literatures, which he was trained in, so he offered those prayers, and hence, hamsa guhyas prayers have a transcendental significance, and it is part of the Srimad Bhagavatam. So, in this verse, in the hamsa guhyas prayers, Prajapati Daksha says, yaiyate kevalayasva samsthaya, hamsa yatasmai shucisadmane namah. Here again, hamsaya, the Lord's position is completely pure. Hamsa, generally, hamsa in Sanskrit means pure. It also refers to the swan, which is very pure, white, pure. And that's how very exalted persons are called paramahamsas, because they are very very pure. hamsaya tasmai shucisadmane namah. shucisadma, shuchi means pure again, sadma means an abode of purity. Only ones whose heart has become completely pure, such people, sadmane, yaiyate kevalayasva samsthaya, yaiyate, yiyate means to perceive, just like anupashyanti, tatvadarshinaha, seeing the Lord, experiencing the Lord, yaiyate, to experience, to perceive the Lord. kevalayasva samsthaya, again, kevalaya means in a complete absorption, state of complete absorption, swasamsthaya, in his original position, yaiyate, can be experienced, that Lord, hamsaya, shucisadmane, when one is in a state of complete purity, one will be able to experience the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "When our consciousness is saturated, spiritually saturated, in that state, one can perceive. This is the message in the Vedic literatures consistently."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the consistent message in Vedic literature that spiritual perception requires a consciousness saturated with transcendental service.

So this is the position that the Vedic literatures have consistently presented. Whether it is in the ancient prayers of Hamsa Guhya, whether it is in the prayers of Shukadev Goswami, or it is in the Padma Purana, which Prabhupada often quotes, ata shri krishnanamadhi nabhaved grahyam indriyaihi sevonmukohi jihvadam, jihvadam. In one place in the Bhagavad Gita, when Prabhupada is quoting this verse, Prabhupada translates the words, the words, sevonmukaha, as when one is spiritually saturated with transcendental service. When our consciousness is spiritually saturated, saturated, we understand that when it is completely absorbed, and nothing else is there, remember in chemistry we used to study, concentrated, saturated solution, means it won't, it is fully saturated, nothing else, you can't add any more salt and it won't dissolve anymore, because the solvent is now saturated. In the same way, when our consciousness is saturated, no material conception, no material desires, no material contaminants, no contamination, no anartha, when it is saturated, spiritually saturated, in that state, one can perceive. This is the message in the Vedic literatures consistently.

**Key Quote:** "If we want to have a perception, a spiritual perception, a transcendental experience, we have to have, these words indicate, there is a certain amount of intensity, there is a certain amount of dedication, and absorption, that is essential."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the need for intensity, dedication, and absorption in spiritual practice, acknowledging the difficulties that may arise in service.

So now we can see, the Lord, the literature, Vedic literature is talking about Samadhi, here Samadhi Bhagyam, Dhyanupashyanti, Samadhi, Dautaya, and Shuchi Sadmane, spiritually saturated, which means, if we want to have a perception, a spiritual perception, a transcendental experience, we have to have, these words indicate, there is a certain amount of intensity, there is a certain amount of dedication, and absorption, that is essential. It's not some kind of a frivolous thing. And if we take it in a very frivolous way, like Shukadeva Goswami says, vadanti chaitat kavayoyata arucham, we will have our own understanding on, based on our mental speculation. But this is not a subject matter of mental speculation, spiritual reality, it is something that we can experience. And for that, it requires a certain dedication, certain intensity, certain absorption. So we should remember this, because life takes us through certain difficulties. When we are doing our service, even with devotees, very often difficulties will come about. Somebody will speak to us in a very harsh way, we will be hurt. Sometimes we will be discouraged by some experience, or we attempt something, and we don't get the result, some discouragement may be there. All of these kind of things will happen, and is bound to happen, in the life of a devotee.

**Key Quote:** "We should remember, what is the purpose of our existence? What is the purpose of our, what we are doing? Isn't it for that single purpose, of that spiritual experience, that we have come to Krishna Consciousness?"
**Summary:** The speaker reminds the audience that the purpose of their existence in Krishna Consciousness is to achieve spiritual experience, which requires dedication and intensity.

At that time, we should remember, what is the purpose of our existence? What is the purpose of what we are doing? Isn't it for that single purpose of that spiritual experience that we have come to Krishna Consciousness? It is not for some better material experience, for a more enhanced and amplified sensual experience, we are here. It is not for some kind of an honor, and distinction, and adoration, and good words from other people, that's not the purpose we are here. So we should remember that it is for that transcendental spiritual experience of the Lord, which the Vedic literatures are promising, the great Acharyas are offering. It is for that. And for that, it requires a certain amount of intensity, dedication. And when we remember that, and all of these material difficulties will become very simple and trivial. We will know how to face all these things. This is the greatest spiritual potency that comes about by our absorption, and that we can face any of the difficulties in this material world. So here we see that these sages now they saw what was actually, what they were seeing in their trance. Now they saw face to face. And throughout the purport, Srila Prabhupada has explained that yes, this is the way it is. At one stage of spiritual development, one will see the Lord in the heart, as Paramatma. And when one becomes more mature, in other words, there are in our spiritual progress, there are gradations. We can become mature, more mature, more mature, and become most mature. And when one becomes most mature, Prabhupada is making a statement, just like we see other things, we can see. Thus the devotee constantly sees the Lord within his heart, and in a more mature stage, one can see the same Lord directly, as we see everything else. You see. And Srimad Bhagavatam is presenting all of these ideas, so that we gradually, we understand the transcendental technique, the science and the technique,

of spiritual perception. And here in these cantos, early cantos of the Bhagavatam, describing about how Vishnu can be seen, and how the great sages saw Vishnu, in all regality, transcendental regality. Because Bhagavatam further intends to present even more higher concept, higher aspects of the absolute truth. Because the highest conception of the absolute truth is not even Vishnu. It is Krishna. And that Krishna, when the Bhagavatam describes about Krishna, and when you see Krishna in Goloka Vrindavana, He will not come with the transcendental regality, and the splendor that you are seeing in the Vaikunthaloka. He will just come with cows and calves, holding a flute, holding a stick, with simple cowherd boys. That is the highest conception of absolute reality. If you cannot have Vishnu conception, if you cannot experience Vishnu, no, forget it. You cannot have access to even higher concepts of the absolute truth. Krishna.

So we can see here how the Bhagavatam is gradually training us about the transcendental reality, gradually understanding. And what is this happening here? With all the chamara, beautiful swan like, appearing like swan, and on all the different paraphernalia, with the associates in grandeur, Vishnu made His appearance. Actually, this is Shantarasa. This is Shantarasa and Dasyarasa, which is prominent in Vaikuntha. Now, if you want to know the highest aspect of the absolute truth, then you must be familiar, and you must know even higher rasas, and what the transcendental interactions with the associates in higher rasa is like. So Bhagavatam is gradually preparing us, telling us about the different transcendental realm. How this transcendental realm of Vaikuntha, how the interactions and the pastimes happen there. Then we will be able to understand even further about Krishna, and Krishna's reality.

You go to a big store and there'll be CCTVs in different places. They'll put a board: "This area is under CCTV surveillance." That means they put a CCTV and they're informing you. Somebody could be watching or somebody is recording. And if we see such a board there, "This is a CCTV surveillance zone," we are careful. We become alert. We don't do some wrong things, right? In the Bhagavatam, it is said, Krishna is the witness of the innermost core of our heart. And the highest yogi is one who is devoted to Krishna in the innermost core of his eye. That is why in Bhakti, we cannot cheat at all. We may cheat externally, others, but Krishna is seated in the heart and He is watching. So we are...

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada wants us to pursue very sublime, very noble, very exalted goal that is love of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of having a mission in life, particularly self-realization and developing love of Krishna, as the most exalted goal.

We must have a mission in our life, so you should be preoccupied. There must be something very exalted in your life that you are pursuing. That's what gives meaning to your life, otherwise life is miserable. I was reading one Australian psychologist, he says, "When you get up in the morning, that exalted thing that you are pursuing in life should be the foremost thing that comes to your mind, and that energizes you. Wow, let me get up and do the work." Vedic culture tells us that the most exalted thing in human life that we should all be doing is self-realization. There are different grades of self-realization, and then there is the highest level of self-realization, and that is awakening our own relationship with the Lord. That should be the dominant thing in our life when we wake up in the morning. That should come to our mind. Prabhupada wants us to pursue very sublime.

## Three Dangerous Diversions from Bhakti-yoga | Sri Chanchalapathi Dasa

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "If you are able to somehow resist the temptation of these three exits, then you can head towards the supreme personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of an expressway to illustrate how karma, mukti, and yogasiddhi can be diversions from the path of bhakti-yoga.

You're driving on the expressway, you're heading very quickly, but then you see exit, food court, and so you exit, and then you'll see so many different kinds of food all displayed there, and then you get absorbed and lost there, and then you missed the purpose that you were heading in the expressway. So, the shastras point out, when you are trying to advance in the mission of human life, you will encounter three exits. The first exit is called karma. The second exit is called mukti, and the third exit is called yogasiddhi. If you are not careful, you can take that exit, and you can be lost there completely, and forget coming back to the exit. So, you're driving on the expressway, and heading towards the goal that you set out. If you are able to somehow resist the temptation of these three exits, then you can head towards the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because, if you want to associate with Krishna, you should be free from the temptations of karma, jnana, and yogasiddhi. That is a pure devotee, who only wants to serve Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the role of Prana in animating the body and how the body will return to its constituent elements (Panchabhutas) when Prana departs, highlighting that all these are products of passion.

Our bodies are activated, are animated, because there is Prana in this body. One day Prana will go, then the body will just remain. The body that we care for, the body that we feed and nourish, the body that we dress and give nice dwelling, will just become Panchabhutas. It will return to Panchabhutas, because Prana Shakti, Prana has gone. So Prabhupada translates Prana as the living energy. It's an energy. Chathai, Jaso, all of them are products of passion.

**Summary:** The lecture discusses how ahankara gives a sense of identity based on the body, such as gender, which is a false sense of identity.

This is an eighth element in the body, just like mind, we think, intelligence, we solve problems, we discriminate, this is right, this is not right, these are all functions of intelligence. In the same way there is an element of ahankara in us which gives us a sense of identity, I am. But it gives a sense of identity in terms of the body. I am a man, I am a woman, that's the first identity we all have, isn't it? Just as soon as we are born, a father, a mother, oh, boy is born, girl is born, you see? Connected with the body, the gender connected with the body. So. So this sense of identity, I am a man, I am a woman, from birth till death that continues.

This life we have taken a male form. In our previous life what we were? Maybe female form, maybe some other form. And in that body we think I am male, I am female. And because we have a male or a female human form, we think I am a human being. This is also part of our self-identity. You see, Vedic knowledge is dealing with these subjects about identity. What is going on in our mind? What is going on in our consciousness? Let's understand. What is the truth behind these things? And since we are born in India, we think I am an Indian man. I am an Indian woman. Someone else born in some other part of the country, they think I am American man. I am German woman or whatever.

This is the kind of a false egoism that is so intrinsic. We live with it. It comes with us all our life. Many things are decided because of these things. I am a man, I am Indian, I am woman.

Like this, many, many, many descriptions of ourselves, ourselves, in terms of the body, we create all through our life. This is the Ahankara manifestation. Next thing the Vedic literatures are pointing out. Now this Ahankara can come under three kinds of influence: Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. And this verse is discussing about this Ahankara under the influence of Rajas.

**Key Quote:** "The most important thing that Rajoguna does is, it puts us in a framework as I am an enjoyer."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Rajoguna leads to the desire for enjoyment, often mixed with Sattva Guna (enlightenment) and Tamoguna (ignorance).

The most important thing that Rajoguna does is, it puts us in a framework as I am an enjoyer. So, I am an enjoyer. I must enjoy. Now I have a body. I must enjoy with this body. Sattva Guna creates a certain kind of an understanding. It enlightens. But usually in the material world, Sattva Guna is never alone. It gets mixed with Rajoguna. So, with a certain kind of an enlightened outlook, we try to become enjoyer. And it is not just that, Sattva Guna and Rajoguna mix. There is also always an element of Tamoguna. And Tamoguna's influence is to create ignorance. So, a sense of enlightenment and knowledge and understanding, with the fundamental desire to enjoy, but covered with a certain amount of ignorance.

**Key Quote:** "Intelligence to counteract the hard struggle for existence, is assisted by the senses for acquiring knowledge. And the living energy maintains himself, by manipulating the active organs, like the hands and legs."
**Summary:** This segment explains how knowledge, when combined with the desire to enjoy, leads to manipulating the world for personal gratification, resulting in a struggle for existence driven by passion.

This is actually what each one of us are. There is some knowledge. And knowledge, when it is charged with enjoying tendency, we look at this world, and we look at, we develop knowledge about this world, and how to manipulate this world, with our knowledge and understanding, for our enjoyment. You see? That's why Prabhupada says in the purport here, the living condition in material existence, depends more or less on one's intelligence and powerful living energy. Intelligence to counteract the hard struggle for existence, is assisted by the senses for acquiring knowledge. And the living energy maintains himself, by manipulating the active organs, like the hands and legs. But on the whole, the struggle for existence is an exertion of the mode of passion.

**Summary:** The lecture discusses how modern knowledge and technology are often used to manipulate the material world for personal enjoyment, stemming from a false sense of identity as a citizen of this world.

Today, there is so much knowledge of science, technology, economics, management. So, all of this is a certain kind of a knowledge. But, it is charged and influenced with Rajas. And so, we use our intelligence, we use our systematic thinking, we use our school and college education, everything, how to manipulate the material world, for my enjoyment. Now, this thinking that, I am a citizen of this world, and I must enjoy this world, this is actually an aspect of ignorance. Because we are not really a citizen of this world. We have come here. We are not these human bodies. We have got a human body. We see around us, there are so many other non-human bodies also. And there are living entities there also. So, this passion, knowledge, and ignorance, combine together, in different ways, and create the material world.

**Summary:** The lecture introduces Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings on detachment from material desires like wealth, followers, and sensual pleasures, contrasting them with the desire for pure devotion.

So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches, na dhanam, na janam, na sundareem, kavitam vajagadisha kamaye, kamaye, na kamaye, I don't want to desire, these things, na dhanam, kamaye, na janam, kamaye, na sundareem, kamaye, na kavitam.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts fleeting material pleasures with the pursuit of moksha and ultimately emphasizes Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's establishment of pure devotional service (bhakti) as superior.

So, in spiritual, in Vedic culture, we learn, these are all not, these are all fleeting things, all the pleasures, of the senses, the pleasures of wealth, the pleasures of women, the pleasures of honor, and fame, and position, and all these things, they are fleeting. Even going to swargaloka, that is also fleeting. Next, we should aspire for moksha, so that we can end, this birth and death cycle, and we can be situated in moksha, and in that way, in moksha there is, ananda of moksha. Again, ananda came there, enjoyment came there. No. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is saying, mama janmani janmanishvare, bhavata bhakti rahayi tukitvayi, I just want to render service to you, life after life. So, I do not want even moksha also. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is establishing the principles of pure devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "When we serve Krishna, we get happiness naturally."
**Summary:** The lecture uses the analogy of the hand feeding the stomach to illustrate how serving Krishna naturally brings happiness, contrasting it with the unnatural attempts at happiness through karma and jnana.

But of course, we are constituted in such a way, that when we serve Krishna, we get happiness naturally. The other methods were not natural to our constitution. Just like, if the hand puts food into the stomach, the hand gets nourished. Natural. But the hand putting the food in the stomach, is a natural constitutional activity. But if the hand says, no, I won't put food in the stomach, I'll only be touching the food. I'll only be mixing rice, chapati, dal, and just, I won't, why should I feed the stomach? Stomach should enjoy, is it? No, I won't allow. Only I'll be touching. Or I'll be only seeing food. We know that won't nourish us. You see, in the same way, all attempts of karma, all attempts of jnana, are attempts for happiness, in an unconstitutional manner. Constitutional meaning, Swaroopa, our makeup, how we are made, how we are constituted. This is the most important thing.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is the ultimate enjoyer and our purpose is to make Him happy, comparing our current material situation to a diseased and uncooperative part of Krishna's body.

That we are not the enjoyers. Krishna is the enjoyer. Krishna alone is the enjoyer. We have only business is to make him happy. Just like the hands, only business is to keep the body in a comfortable situation. We want to have bath, the hands and the legs will work to give bath. We want to dress up, we want to put tilak, hands and legs assist me to put the tilak. We want to eat, hands and legs help. See how hands and legs are parts of the body, they are constantly working for the upkeep and well-being of the whole body. If hands and legs don't cooperate, it is called a diseased condition. We have to go to a doctor, we have to take some treatment, we have to take some treatment. Hand is not working, I am not able to lift my hand, I can't bend, fold my hand. Oh, you have to go to your doctor, you should examine. See hand is not able to work for the whole. Today our material situation is, we are also components, parts of Krishna, but we are the diseased, uncooperative, unwilling to serve the pleasure, for the pleasure of Krishna.

And that spirit of enjoyment is not natural to us. It is infused through the Rajoguna. Why, who is doing this? Krishna is only doing this. Oh, Krishna is, why Krishna is doing? Because we want it.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna has created this material world. You need a platform for activity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna created the material world as a platform for our spirit of enjoyment and that even after entering spiritual life, the desire to be the enjoyer and controller persists.

He has given us a material body with the five senses, dasha indriya, dasha buddhi, and he has created this material world. You need a platform for activity. Suppose I am a great singer, or I am a great dancer, I am a great performer. All the artists, they always say, can we come to your temple and sing? Can we come to your temple? Of course, they are devotional people, they say. Because they want a platform for their activity. In the same way, we want a platform for our spirit of enjoyment. So Krishna has created this material world. See how this is what's happening. Now another thing that happens to us, Srila Prabhupada, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu won. Now we come to spiritual life, spiritual understanding, we come to a spiritual organization, but that spirit for enjoyment won't go away so easily. In the spiritual society, in the spiritual organization, we will try again, I should become the enjoyer, I should become the controller.

To free ourselves from that enjoying spirit, first is our determination and our desire that yes, I want to be free from this. And when Krishna sees that, when Balarama sees that, when Nithyananda Prabhu sees that, they will bless us. Because by our own we cannot get out. It's a Daivi Guna. These forces of Rajoguna, they are all divine. So it's very powerful.

That is why we must desire, we must make that desire sincere, and we must make that desire strong. And a strong desire is nothing but determination. And through that determination, we demonstrate to Krishna that I want to abstain from acts of enjoyment. We use our body, we act, we feed our body, take care of our body, to the extent of, to the extent required for self-preservation only. If you don't feed the body, we cannot do, the body will not have energy, we cannot do anything productive. So, some Shakti is required. So we eat, we sleep, we accept these some comforts, only to the extent of self-preservation. And otherwise, our intent is to only give pleasure to Krishna. So, this enjoying tendency created by passion, how this is all brought about...

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding our situation and constantly reminding ourselves of Vedic knowledge through classes, reading, and discussions for self-purification, especially in Kali Yuga.

So we should know our situation, we should know this, what is happening, so that we can be constantly reminded in Kali Yuga, or in every time in a material existence, a mind is weak. And we need to constantly remind ourselves. That is why the Shastras are there, Vedic knowledge is there, so that we refresh our memory, our intelligence, our understanding, daily, by class, by reading books, like Srila Prabhupada has given those, these books. So, and by discussing among ourselves, and by telling others, because when we are telling others, first person who is hearing is ourself. I am giving class, but the first hearer is, some of you may slightly doze off a little, you won't, something you may miss. But one person who is not missing anything, very attentively hearing the class, is myself. So it is for my own purification. So, we speak in different kinds of forum, one on one, one to many, or different ways, mean our purification, self-purification, self-purification. This is the most important thing that we should try for.

And what is just like you study in anatomy you see there is a bone stress skeletal structure that gives strength to this body there is a muscular structure there is a nervous structure nervous system in the same way that what is energizing this body is the consciousness and that consciousness is the sitting place ultimately of karma that karma sitting in consciousness it will just sit there no it will come through mind intelligence and senses so that we can act and we can fulfill that karma for our karma is not a static thing desire is not a it is it is dynamic force you see and the dynamism is brought through these instruments of mind intelligence and sense organ like that so kama is sitting in all these places krishna is describing.

**Key Quote:** "In an ideal pure devotee state even he is in the material world we He is called a Jeevan Mukta."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that spiritual advancement involves decreasing the desire for personal enjoyment and increasing the desire to serve Krishna, culminating in the state of Jeevan Mukta, where one is fully devoted to Krishna even while in the material world.

Our desire to enjoy the material world is 100, our desire to enjoy to serve Krishna 0 in one sense. But okay, we have moved up in spiritual life, maybe 95 percent is desire to enjoy and 5% we want to serve Krishna, we have understood little bit. This is our situation, we have a mixed situation. So the material world is a platform, is an opportunity where we can try to experience that ninety-five percent desire to enjoy oneself and also 5% to serve the Lord. And as we become spiritually advanced, 95 keeps decreasing, the five keeps increasing. And in an ideal pure devotee state, even he is in the material world, he is called a Jeevan Mukta. He is in this material world. 100% desire to serve Krishna, 0% to enjoy himself. He is called Jeevan Mukta.

**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges the duality of our current situation and emphasizes the spiritualist's struggle to minimize self-enjoyment and maximize Krishna's enjoyment, describing the spiritual world as one where everyone is engaged in serving the Lord, and defining mixed devotion.

There is a dual situation like you are describing. But the struggle of a spiritualist is how I can minimize my self-enjoyment, sense my self-enjoyment, how I can maximize Krishna's enjoyment. In the spiritual world, everyone, 100% is engaged in serving the Lord and giving pleasure to the Lord. That's another world. Just like here you see there is one world here. Everyone. Everyone is trying to enjoy for oneself. But we have some religious, due to culture. Our parents were taking us to temple. We had some religious functions in our home. So there is some cultural religiosity is there. By culture there is some, which recognizes God. And hence, we go to God. We go to a temple and pray. Krishna, I've got these so many desires. Can you please bless me so that I can enjoy in this world? Yes. But we are going to temple. That's Bhakti. Yes, that's Bhakti. It is called Mishra Bhakti. Karma Mishra Bhakti. It is Bhakti, but largely combined with the desire for enjoyment.

**Summary:** The lecture explains that through bhakti, unwanted desires (anarthas) gradually diminish, leading to a stronger desire to serve Krishna and becoming a strong devotee.

But by doing Bhakti, Anartha Nivrutti Syat, what happens is that all these desires for enjoying, gradually diminishes. Anartha. These are unwanted things. They are valueless things. Anartha. Artha means valuable. Anartha means no value. They have no value for us. Truly. But we are holding on to it. Now Bhakti makes us release all that. Nivrutti. Anartha Nivrutti. So gradually that desire for self-enjoyment diminishes. And the desire to serve Krishna increases. And when it is more and more stronger, then we are called strong devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Svargaloka offers enhanced material enjoyment but lacks true spirituality, reiterating Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's preference for pure devotion over the path to Svarga.

Yes, the body changes. Yes. What? . No. Svargaloka, these are all different arrangements for more material enjoyment. Not much of spirituality there. In Svarga, you will get a body which has a long life. We only live for about 100 years. Out of 100, after 70, what enjoyment you can do? Your body has become very old. So, in Svargaloka you will have 1000 years life. So long you can enjoy. So, Svarga is nothing but an opportunity for enhanced enjoyment. For one's own enjoyment, not for Krishna. But that also with Krishna's blessing. So, this is the kind of a situation. Svarga is also not desirable in that sense. That's why Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is saying, Na kavitam. I don't want to follow this path of Svargaloka, Vedic path and go to Svarga. I don't want that. Janmani janmani Ishvare bhavatad bhakti rahaituki. Bhavatad bhakti. Your devotion is only, I am asking.

**Summary:** The speaker establishes that everything, including our bodies and strength, belongs to Sri Rama, and we should use them in His service.

I have come into this world, I have this Panchabhuta Sharira, Antribhuta Sharira, Sukshma Sharira. To whom does all this belong? Am I the owner of all this? Am I the owner of this body and the owner of the senses? Am I the owner of myself? To whom do I belong? Oh, we have this body, whatever strength we have, may not be much, but all of this belongs to Sri Rama, and we all belong to Sri Rama. We must use all of this to serve Rama. This is the thinking of a Bhatta. This world belongs to the Lord. Isha Vasya Midam Sarvam. Everything that is there, everything, the Lord is the owner. The Lord is the owner.
