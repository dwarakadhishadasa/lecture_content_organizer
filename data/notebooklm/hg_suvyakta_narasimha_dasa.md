**Key Quote:** "Varahadeva is completely unperturbed because the Lord is the supreme proprietor of everything."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Hiranyaksha and Varahadeva, emphasizing the Lord's supreme power and the insignificance of demons before Him.

Because he wanted to show off. So then he approached Varanadeva and he said, I heard you are very powerful, why don't you fight with me? So Varanadeva said, I am old, I am retired, please leave me Baba, don't fight with me, don't worry, soon there will come one person, Vishnu will come, he will take care of you. So from that time, he was searching, where is Vishnu? So when he came across finally Varanadeva, Vishnu in the form of Varanadeva, so he was thinking that, ah, I am so powerful, I will finish off this Vishnu also, what is this Vishnu in front of me? So until that point of time, nobody had dared to stand up and talk to him even. So when he approached Varanadeva and started insulting him, Varanadeva immediately gave it back to him. So he got angry, how can somebody talk to me like this? So, Shaila Prabhupada is saying here, the Bhagavatam is saying here, that in the purport, Shaila Prabhupada is saying, that a cobra may be very fierce for an ordinary person. Like I said, if a cobra were to enter into this room, what would happen? Everyone would start running here and there, right? No one will sit here. But if there is a snake charmer, among the monsters, what he will do, he will not fear, he will immediately take out his, whatever that he blows, and he will immediately start chanting his mantras and he will subdue the serpent. Simply catch it with his hand and he will take it and go away, isn't it? Just like in Vandavan, because we are in the midst of open fields, sometimes snakes come into our campus. So when snakes come, then all the staff, everybody starts running around and everybody is yelling and shouting and all that, and we get some snake charmer. So when the snake charmer comes, everybody tells him, see, it's there in that bush, it is sitting there. So he will go there, he will put his hand, take it and he will have a basket, he will put in that, he will take and he will go. And you pay him something for that. So snake charmer is not afraid of the snake. For him, what is there, it is a plaything. So similarly, Hiranyaksha, a demon, might sometimes become very powerful. He may become extremely powerful. Just like this Hiranyaksha, he is so powerful, even the devatas, none of the devatas were courageous enough to stand in front of him. Even Varanadeva said, no, I don't want to fight with you. So a demon may become so powerful, but in front of the Lord, in front of Vishnu, in front of Krishna, they are nothing. So Varahadeva is not perturbed by Hiranyaksha's strength or his power or his reputation.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So no matter how powerful a demon may become, for the Supreme Lord, he is nothing."
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the source of power through the story of Hiranyakashipu and Prahlad, highlighting that even demons' power comes from Vishnu and devotees may face harassment from demons, but the Lord ultimately protects them.

Varahadeva is completely unperturbed because the Lord is the supreme proprietor of everything. He is the most powerful, he is all-powerful. And in fact, all power is coming from him. If the demon is powerful, where is that power coming from? Just like when Hiranyakashyapu, he was trying to kill Prahlad Maharaj, his own son, five-year-old son. He tried various means to kill him. Put him into a pit full of snakes, threw him down from the top of a cliff, tried to trample him with elephants, all of that failed. And when that failed, Hiranyakashyapu started getting afraid. And he questioned Prahlad Maharaj, where are you getting this power from? None of the devatas can stand in front of me, you are just a five-year-old kid, and all my attempts to kill you are failing. How have you become so much powerful? So Prahlad Maharaj replied, whatever is the source of your power is also the source of my power, which is Vishnu. So when he heard that, Hiranyakashyapu could not tolerate. That is how he said, where is your Vishnu, show me, is he in this pillar? And we know the rest, what happened. So, no matter how powerful a demon may become, for the Supreme Lord, he is nothing. And these demons, when they become powerful, they try to harass devotees. So sometimes devotees become perturbed that this demon is there, he is attacking, he is creating so much harassment for us. Just like Hiranyakashyapu, so much he harassed Prahlad Maharaj. And Prahlad Maharaj was very disturbed, but he pacified himself by remembering Vishnu and Krishna. By chanting Krishna's holy name, he managed to calm himself. So similarly, in all of our devotees' lives, there will be circumstances where we will see some demon become very powerful. And he will harass devotees. It may, the harassment may last for several years.

### Ravana's power and defeat, Lord Shiva's helplessness, Krishna's protection

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Rakhe Krishna Mareke, Mare Krishna Rakheke."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Ravana's defeat by Lord Ramachandra, emphasizing that even Lord Shiva could not protect Ravana when Krishna decided to kill him, illustrating the principle that whom Krishna protects, no one can kill, and whom Krishna wants to kill, no one can protect.

But finally, when the Lord decides to vanquish him, then nobody can come in the way. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada is mentioning the pastime of Ravana. Ravana was another demon who was so powerful. He was so powerful that he wanted to build a staircase directly to heaven. He was thinking, what is all this Punya, Girnya and all you have to go to heaven? I will build one staircase, let everyone go. What, only devatas should enjoy heaven or what? So he started building a staircase to heaven. He was so powerful. And he was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. And because of pleasing Lord Shiva, he had become very powerful. So when the battle between Ravana and Lord Ramachandra was going on, the fight was raging. And on one side, Ravana, on the other side, Ramachandra. And arrows were being exchanged, weapons were being aimed at each other. The fight was going on. And one by one, slowly all of Ravana's weapons were getting destroyed. So his chariot got destroyed, his horses were destroyed, his charioteer was finished, his flag was cut off, everything was finished. And then his bow also broke. So then Ramachandra fixed his last bow, last arrow on his bow. And he aimed it at Ravana. And Ravana knew, this is the end. Now, I cannot protect myself. So he immediately remembered Lord Shiva. And he started calling out to Lord Shiva. Go Shiva, please protect me, please save me. So Lord Shiva was sitting in Kailasa, sitting with Parvati Devi. So Lord Shiva heard Ravana's cry. Ravana's cry reached up till there. But Lord Shiva was unmoved. He was silently sitting. So Parvati Devi, naturally because she is Lord Shiva's wife, so she has a... She has that little bit of familiarity with him. So she said, What is this you are sitting here, your devotee is crying. Go, do something. Just like wives will tell husbands, No, what useless fellow sitting there, do something. No, like that. No, like that Parvati Devi will tell, What is this you are sitting here, your devotee is crying. Why don't you go and do something? So Lord Shiva replied, Devi, what can I do? Supreme Lord Ramachandra has decided to kill him. What will I do going to there? The Lord has already decided, I cannot do anything, sorry. So Ravana was crying and crying for Lord Shiva's protection. But in the meantime, Ramachandra fixed his arrow, released it and Ravana was finished. So even Lord Shiva refused to protect Ravana because he knew that now that Ramachandra Bhagavan, he has decided to kill Ravana, even I cannot protect him. Srila Prabhupada used to often quote that saying, Rakhe Krishna Mareke, Mare Krishna Rakheke. Rakhe Krishna, if Krishna wants to protect someone, Mareke, who can kill him? Just like Krishna wanted to protect Prahlad Maharaj, even Hiranyakashipu could not do anything. And on the other hand, Mare Krishna, if Krishna wants to kill someone, just like Ramachandra decided to kill Ramana, Rakheke, who can protect that person?

### Humility of devotees, Difference between Lord's and demon's anger, Source of anger for non-devotees
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/KTHudZWO2Ac?t=782
**Verse References:** BG 2.62
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So the source of anger amongst non-devotees is the desire for sense gratification."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the humility of devotees with the pride of demons, explaining that the Lord's anger is for the welfare of living entities, while the anger of non-devotees arises from the desire for sense gratification, as explained in Bhagavad Gita.

Nobody can protect. So, the demons become very puffed up by their own power and strength, thinking that they are all powerful. But devotees, as devotees, we should not become puffed up whenever the Lord invests certain power in us for executing certain services. So as devotees, devotees are always humble and they know that the source of my strength and power is Krishna, is Vishnu. So they always treat that power which is invested in them by Krishna with lot of humility. Another thing that we can notice here is that Varahadeva also became angry and Hiranyakashipu also became angry. Both of them became angry. So what is the difference between the Lord and the demon? So the difference is that when the Lord becomes angry, his anger is for the welfare of the living entity. The Lord for the welfare of the demons, he becomes angry with them. So that by his anger, he can punish them and by that punishment they become purified of their offenses and they can become liberated. Whereas, the source of anger for the asuras, it's something else. Actually, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 62nd verse, 62nd and 63rd verse, Krishna explains what is the source of anger for the non-devotees. So Krishna says in the 62nd verse, ध्यायतो विषयान पुम्सा संगस्तेशु पजायते संगार्थ संजायते कामहा प्रोधो विजायते While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them and from such attachment, lust develops and from lust, anger arises. So the source of anger amongst non-devotees is the desire for sense gratification. So because of the desire for sense gratification, when a person contemplates on the objects of the senses, he develops attachment for them, he wants to fulfill his desire to gratify his senses. And then when he, and out of that and from such attachment, when he lusts after satisfying that desire, eventually that lust becomes frustrated. He is not able to fulfill that lust to the fullest extent. Then because of that frustration, anger arises.

### Dangers of anger, Importance of sense control (Dhamma), Importance of mind control (Shama)
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/KTHudZWO2Ac?t=949
**Verse References:** BG 2.63, BG 2.58, BG 2.60
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "From anger, delusion arises and from delusion, bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost. And when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the dangers of anger, leading to delusion and downfall, and emphasizes the importance of both sense control (Dhamma) and mind control (Shama) for spiritual progress, referencing verses from the Bhagavad Gita.

Now when a normal conditioned soul becomes angry, Krishna explains further in the next verse what actually further happens, what does that anger lead to? क्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोहाथ स्मुर्थि विभ्रमः स्मुर्थि ब्रंशाद् बुद्धि नाश्यो बुद्धि नाश्याद् प्रणश्यति From anger, delusion arises and from delusion, bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost. And when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool. So we can see here, Krishna is describing the danger of becoming subjugated by anger. Actually in fact, in the little previous to this, in the 58th verse, Krishna mentions यदा सम्हरते चायम कोर्मों गानेव सर्वशः इन्द्रियाणि इन्द्रियार्थेब्य स्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws his limbs within the shell, is to be understood as truly situated in knowledge. So Krishna in the 58th verse, he spoke about Dhamma, controlling the senses. That we all have to control our senses. The senses cannot be freely left to enjoy the sense objects. Now Dhamma entails gross control of the senses. Whereas in the 62nd and 63rd verse, Krishna is speaking actually of Shama, controlling the mind. One is the force of the senses, which impels us to enjoy the sense objects. And the second is the force of the mind. The mind generates certain desires. So if the mind is uncontrolled, then it finally leads to anger, and anger leads to further entanglement in this material world. So, Shama and Dhamma. Dhamma is important, Shama is also important. If we do not control our senses, if Dhamma is not practiced, Krishna says what happens in the 60th verse. He says, यततो ही अप्यकाऊंते ये पुरिशत्सि विपस्चिता इन्द्रियानि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसवं मनः The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavouring to control them. So even a knowledgeable person, even a person who is a person of discrimination, not an ordinary person, विपस्चिता a person of discrimination, a learned person, an intelligent person, a person who is a ज्यानी even such a person, if his senses are not controlled, what will happen? He will be led to destruction. So, one is दमा another is शमा as we read in the 62nd and 63rd verses, if a person does not practice शमा, he may very well control his senses, but then, if his mind is not controlled, then that will eventually again lead him to destruction.

### Practice of Dhamma and Shama for devotees, Dangers of uncontrolled mind, Mood of the Brajavasis

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "I am not attached to doing something big or small, I am attached to pleasing Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while devotees easily practice Dhamma (sense control), Shama (mind control) is often overlooked, and emphasizes the importance of controlling the mind to avoid frustration and maintain interest in Krishna consciousness, highlighting the selfless mood of the Brajavasis who only desire to please Krishna.

So both दमा and शमा are important. Now, in the case of devotees, what happens is दमा is very easily practiced. We follow the four regularity principles strictly, then automatically दमा is practiced. And, but then शमा is something which we consciously, we may miss out in practicing. दमा is very conscious, we will consciously follow. I should avoid onion, garlic, I should not eat meat, I should eat only कृष्ण प्रसादम, very easily we can follow. But शमा is something which many times may miss our attention, that we have to control the mind also. On one level, controlling the mind means we do not allow the mind to dwell on material sense objects. On a higher plane, दमा also means that we cannot allow the mind to think whatever it wants. Sometimes devotees get carried away, that no according to me it should be like this, according to me we should do like this. And then when things don't happen according to the way they are thinking, they become frustrated. And they start thinking, what is all this, I thought I came to devotional service thinking that everything will be nice here, but there are so many problems here, this is not okay, that is not okay. And finally the person will lose his interest in कृष्ण consciousness. So, in the case of devotees, we have to be very careful to practice this शमा, this control of the mind. Sometimes this uncontrolled mind will generate some thoughts which will seem almost like devotional service, it will look like devotional service only. Sometimes devotees think, no I should do something big for कृष्ण and we give them some service, what is this small service you are giving me, I want to do something big, give me some bigger service. So, actually if one has such a mentality, even if one becomes a PR devotee, one will not be able to have permanent residence in the spiritual world. One will have to keep coming back to that. One will have to keep coming back to the material world. Because if we have that desire, I should do something big for कृष्ण. कृष्ण will say, okay, you continue doing that in the material world, you be there and you keep doing big things. Such people will generally become देवताःs. They are pure devotees, but they become देवताःs because they have some desire to serve कृष्ण in some big capacity. So कृष्ण says, okay, remain in the material world and do big things. So, a devotee of the highest order, will generally, will not have this kind of thought. If we look at the ब्रजवासीs, why are they considered the topmost devotees, even above the देवताःs? Why? Because the ब्रजवासीs, they have no desire other than to please कृष्ण. If कृष्ण is pleased by my doing some small service, I will do that small service. I will be happy doing that small service. If कृष्ण wants me to do some big service, then I will do that big service. I am not attached to doing something big or small, I am attached to pleasing कृष्ण.

### Srila Prabhupada's example, Surrender to Krishna's will, Glories of Goloka Vrindavan devotees

**Key Quote:** "Make me a success or a failure as you wish."
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the mood of a topmost devotee through Srila Prabhupada's example, emphasizing his surrender to Krishna's will and detachment from success or failure, highlighting the respect and glorification of devotees in Goloka Vrindavan.

This is the mood of the ब्रजवासीs. And we can see that very strongly reflected in प्रभुपाद's life also. When प्रभुपाद was going to the US on the जलदूता, he wrote the poem, मार्किने भागवत धर्म So there, प्रभुपाद says, he prays for प्रभुपाद, he prays to कृष्ण, प्रभुपाद prays to कृष्ण, saying that, you have brought me to this land of the मलेचास and यवनास I do not know whether I will be able to convince them about कृष्ण consciousness. And then प्रभुपाद says, make me a success or a failure as you wish. You see, प्रभुपाद did not pray, कृष्ण I have come here to serve you, please make me a big success. प्रभुपाद is saying, make me a success or a failure as you wish. And प्रभुपाद says, make me dance, make me dance, make me dance. You see, this is the mood of a devotee of the topmost order. He is not attached to doing something big or something small. He just sees what कृष्ण wants. If कृष्ण is happy by my becoming a failure, I will become a failure. If कृष्ण is happy by my going to नरका, I will go to नरका. If कृष्ण wants me to go to स्वर्गा, I will go to स्वर्गा. Doesn't matter where I go, the central point is pleasing कृष्ण. And this is the mood of devotees in गोलोक वृण्दावन. Therefore, those devotees in गोलोक वृण्दावन are always respected everywhere. They are glorified by all devotees, by देवताश्य, everyone glorifies them, they respect them, they look up to them. They aspire to become like them. This is the standard of the highest order of devotees. And the same thing is what Śrīla Prabhupāda taught us, and the same thing

### Following Srila Prabhupada's example, Satisfying Krishna in whatever service, Dangers of seeking attention and praise

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even the smallest thing, just cleaning the floor, you do it nicely, it's enough."
**Summary:** The speaker encourages devotees to follow Srila Prabhupada's example by satisfying Krishna and Prabhupada in whatever service they are given, emphasizing that even the smallest service done with dedication is pleasing to them, and cautioning against the desire for attention and praise.

Prabhupāda demonstrated in his life also. So we have to, we as devotees, following in Śrīla Prabhupāda's footsteps, following the example that Śrīla Prabhupāda said, we should try to satisfy कृष्ण and Śrīla Prabhupāda in whatever service we are given. It's not that we have to do something really big to satisfy प्रवुपा and कृष्ण. Even the smallest thing, just cleaning the floor, you do it nicely, it's enough. कृष्ण and प्रवुपा is pleased. If प्रवुपा and कृष्ण are pleased by my cleaning the floor, I'll keep cleaning the floor all throughout my life, no problem. This is the real mood of a devotee and one has to train one's mind to accept this mood and practice this mood. Otherwise mind always wants to do something which will gain lot of attention, lot of पूजा, प्रतिष्ठा, लाभा. So if I do some big service, many people will come and congratulate me, many people will come and praise me, that is very pleasing for me. Therefore I want to do big service. So the mind always tends towards these things. So actually in our condition stage, if we think that I want to do something big for कृष्ण, actually the motivation is not pleasing कृष्ण. The motivation is I want to do something big so that everybody will appreciate, people's attention will be there. Right now I am doing something nobody comes to know about it. What is this? I am going inside the अस्तन पुजार room, something I am scrubbing, nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody appreciates. So that's not the point. So we should be careful. So this will look almost like कृष्ण consciousness. We are serving कृष्ण only, what is wrong? But actually behind that there is another thing going. So we have to be careful about this, what we think, we have to control, we have to train the mind to be satisfied

### Satisfaction in assigned duties, Freedom from material duties, Reactions for not performing duties

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For him there is no duty."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees who do not find full satisfaction in performing their assigned devotional service become liable for not performing their material duties, quoting Bhagavad Gita to emphasize that only those who are fully satisfied in the self are free from all duties.

in whatever service is given to us. Actually कृष्ण explains in the third chapter of the बगवत गीता, I will read that verse. एस्तु आत्मरतिरैवस्यात् आत्मत्रप्तस्य मानवः आत्मसंतुष्टस्तस्य कार्यम्न विद्यते So for a person who is engaged in devotional service, what happens is we devotees, we do not practice any other duties that we are supposed to perform according to the Vedas. According to the Vedas we have so many रनाs to fulfill, रनाs to parents, रना to one's forefathers, रना to the देवता's, रना to the teachers, रना to the रिशी's, रना to the रिशी's, so many people, we have so many kinds of रनाs. But then what happens is we don't follow any of those, actually in Kali Yuga nobody follows any of those duties. Instead, it is said that in Kali Yuga we have to simply serve Krishna, right? Now if we don't perform our duties which are enjoined in the scriptures, actually one becomes liable to liable for the reactions to those sinful activities. It is considered a sinful activity not to perform one's duties. Now as devotees what happens is if we do not find full satisfaction in performing one's devotional service whatever is assigned to us, then actually we will also become liable for not performing those material duties. That is why Krishna says यस्त्वात्मरेतिरेवस्यात् आत्मत्रत्तस्यमानमः आत्मन्येवसंतुष्टस्तस्यकार्यम्नविद्यते कार्यम्नविद्यते means a person does not have to perform those duties. Who is the person who does not have to perform those duties? This is the seventeenth verses. One who is taking pleasure in the self, number one. Number two, one who is illumined in the self. And number third, one who rejoices in the self, number three, and is satisfied with the self only, fully satiated, for him there is no duty. So, until and unless we come to the point where one is completely satisfied in performing whatever duties are assigned to one by one spiritual master, then one cannot, until that point one cannot be free from the obligations to perform one's material duties. So as devotees we should train our mind to be satisfied, to take satisfaction only in performing the assigned duties to us in whatever service we are doing. If we are not feeling that satisfaction, then we have to understand that I am going to get the reaction for all, for not performing all my material duties.

**Key Quote:** "And thus one can be safe from the dangerous effects of Krodha."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of practicing Shama (mind control) to avoid sense gratification and the dangerous effects of anger, opening the floor for questions and comments.

So, this is another important thing that in the practice of Shama, that devotees have to diligently follow. So, if one practices controlling the mind in this fashion, if one practices Shama, then naturally one does not, one's mind will not try to find satisfaction in the sense objects. And when our mind is not engaged in trying to satisfying the sense objects, there is no question of frustration of one's attempts leading to Krodha or anger. And thus one can be safe from the dangerous effects of Krodha. So these are some of the points which we can glean from this. If there are any questions or comments,

### Desire to serve Krishna, Devotional service of the highest order, Serving Krishna according to His desire

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Desiring to serve Krishna in some big way, it is not that it is not devotional service."
**Summary:** In response to a question, the speaker clarifies that desiring to serve Krishna in any way is devotional service, but the highest order of devotional service is to desire to serve Krishna according to His desire.

A devotee is denying some, you said that if a devotee is denying some services, discriminating the services, and in the future he may become a pure devotee, you mentioned. So how does the devotee who denies, discriminates the services, becomes a pure devotee? I didn't get the question. What was that? You said in the class, if a devotee is denying the menial services, want to do some big services, so in the future if he becomes a pure devotee also, he will become Devata in the material world. So how does a devotee who denies the, discriminates the services, and he can become a pure devotee? Well, the point is that, desiring to serve Krishna, in any way, is also devotional service only. It's not that it is not devotional service. If somebody desires, I should serve Krishna in some big way, it is not out of the ambit of devotional service. Because of one's past conditioning, one may have that ambition to do something big. So you dovetail that desire in doing something big for Krishna. Nothing wrong in that. But then, one has to go beyond even that. One has to, one has to go to a stage, where one will be simply interested in, serving Krishna's desires, whether as a success or a failure. So, such a devotee, when he becomes completely liberated, he will go to the supreme abode. He will go to the Goloka Vrindavan. So that is the point. So, desiring to serve Krishna in some big way, it is not that it is not devotional service. So that is also devotional service only, but it is not devotional service of the highest order. The main point is, when, when, higher than that is, to desire to serve Krishna according to his desire. That is more, that is even higher than desiring to serve Krishna in some big way. Is that okay?

### Taking pleasure in the self, Atmarathi, Atmatruthah, Atmanyeva Santoshra, Progressive state of spiritual advancement

**Key Quote:** "By serving Krishna, everything else is performed."
**Summary:** In response to a question, the speaker explains the meaning of 'taking pleasure in the self' and the progressive states of Atmarathi, Atmatruthah, and Atmanyeva Santoshra, emphasizing that a person who is satisfied with the Self has come to a final conclusion and understands that by serving Krishna, everything else is performed.

Yes, please. Taking pleasure in the self, what it actually means. When we say taking pleasure only in the self, what it means is that, one, like Prabhupada is mentioning here, in the purport to that 17th verse, I will read that. Actually, those three things, that Prabhupada mentions, Krishna mentions, Atmarathi, Atmatruthah, and Atmanyeva Santoshra. These three are connected. So, Atmarathi means, a person, when a person engages in, when a, when a person, Atmarathi means one who takes pleasure only in the self. A person who is fully Krishna conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts in Krishna consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform. Due to his being Krishna conscious, all impiety within is instantly cleansed, and effect of many many thousands of Vijnaya performances. So actually Atmarathi means, a person who understands that, he is not the body, he is a spirit soul. So he is interested only in spiritual subject matter. He is not interested in satisfying his senses, right? So he is not interested in searching after the sense objects. He is more interested in understanding, he is more interested in understanding about himself, in spiritual subject matter. So such a person is said to be, taking pleasure only in the self. And, when one engages in, in devotional service to Krishna, with that understanding, that he wants to, with that, keeping away the desire for sense gratification, then what happens is, by such clearing of consciousness, one becomes fully confident of his eternal position, in relationship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated. So, Atma-tripta, Srila Prabhupada is translating, Atma-tripta as, one who is illumined in the self. So illumined in the self meaning, when one is engaged in understanding, when one is engaged in spiritual pursuit, and one engages in service to Krishna, one understands that, Oh! I am a servant of Krishna. This is my true position. So, such a position is called, self-illuminated, means he understands that he is a servant of Krishna, he is a part and parcel of Krishna, and he has to serve Krishna. And such a person, Atma-santushtaha, he is satisfied with the self only. Meaning, he is fully satiated, meaning he is satisfied, so by, first is he, he takes, he does activities only, related to spiritual subject matter. He is not interested in sense gratification. That is Atmarathi. And as an Atmarathi, when one understands that I am, I have to serve Krishna, I am a part and parcel of Krishna, then he becomes self-illuminated. Atma-tripta. And when in, when, when on that platform of understanding, I am part and parcel of Krishna, one is completely satisfied by serving Krishna. Oh! I am part and parcel of Krishna, I do service for Krishna, I am fully satisfied. He doesn't, he has come to a final conclusion. He is no more searching. There is no more search. What am I supposed to do? What are my duties? Nothing. This is the final thing. By serving Krishna, everything else is performed. So that is the level of satisfaction that a person feels. So then, that person is called an Atma-santushta. So that is a person who is satiated only in, only with the Self. So one is taking pleasure in the Self, one is illumined in the Self, and finally, one is satisfied with the Self. So this is, these are the three things. It's a progressive state.

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada is giving us residence in Goloka Vrindavan."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between Devatas and Brajavasis, highlighting that Brajavasis serve Krishna out of pure love, beyond a sense of duty, and emphasizes that by following Srila Prabhupada's instructions and understanding his mood, we can attain residence in Goloka Vrindavan.

Yes. Not necessarily, because Devatas have, there are many kinds of personalities amongst Devatas also. There are, there are, they are all devotees, they may, some of them are Sakama Bhaktas, some of them are pure devotees, Devatas are all kinds. Brajavas is, Brajavas is of course, they are, they are not only satisfied in serving Krishna, they are, they are serving Krishna out of full love. So they are beyond even this stage, right? You see, the difference between the Brajavasis and a normal devotee is, a liberated devotee is, a liberated devotee still has a sense of duty. He is performing his service to Krishna out of his sense of duty. I am a servant of Krishna, Krishna is the Supreme Lord, so I have to serve Him. That sense is there. Whereas in the Brajavasis, they are, they are not bothered whether Krishna is Supreme Person or not, they are not bothered. We just love Krishna, we want to serve Him. That's all. So they are even beyond that. So they are, the whole mood is simply out of love, they are serving Krishna. They are in Krishna Prema. That's the stage. We have to, we have to follow in their footsteps. That is the standard that Prabhupada has given us and that's what we have to. If we simply follow the instructions of Srila Prabhupada, if we study his books properly and understand Prabhupada's mood, just like I was explaining the poem that Prabhupada has written, so if you understand Prabhupada's mood and follow that, we will be, we will be following the footsteps of the Brajavasis. Because Prabhupada has given us the ultimate thing, nothing beyond this. There is nothing over and above what Prabhupada has given. Simply we follow Prabhupada's instructions, read his books nicely and, and understand that Prabhupada's mood, then we will, we will, actually Prabhupada is giving us residence in Goloka Vrindavan. Not even Vaikuntha Loka, not in any of the other spiritual planets. He is giving us opportunity to go back to the, to Goloka Vrindavan itself. That is the, that is what actually Prabhupada has given us. It is the ultimate that Prabhupada has given us. We can never, we can never appreciate enough the, the glory of what Prabhupada has given us.

### Accepting service from authority, Surrender to Srila Prabhupada, Flaws in surrender

**Key Quote:** "It all depends on the extent of surrender that we are having towards Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** In response to a final question, the speaker explains that accepting whatever service is assigned to one as coming from Srila Prabhupada requires a lot of surrender, and that any flaws or defects we see in the services or management are actually resulting from a flaw in ourselves and our surrender.

Yes please. Final question. Prabhu just wanted to know if, can one take for granted that whatever service comes from authority is perfect? You see, to be able to accept whatever service is assigned to one, as coming from Srila Prabhupada, requires a lot of surrender. If one is sufficiently advanced in Krishna Consciousness and one has surrendered sufficiently to the spiritual master, whatever service is allocated to one, that is actually it will be coming from Prabhupada. Because if you see, in that sense, what is this institution? This institution is set up by Srila Prabhupada. And Srila Prabhupada is giving instructions to all of us through a certain system that he has set up. There is a temple president, there is a temple commander, etc., etc. There is a hierarchy that is set up in the institution. And Prabhupada set this up to disseminate his instructions. So, if, actually, the, the, any flaw or any defect that we may see in the services or in the, in the, in the management of the temple actually is resulting from a flaw in ourselves. If we are flawed in our surrender, then to that extent, we will see flaws everywhere. We will see defects. If we are surrendered to the extent that we are able to appreciate whatever, this is a system that Prabhupada has set up, therefore whatever is coming in this, I accept as coming from Prabhupada. The service that is being allocated to me is coming to me from Prabhupada through this system, then actually what happens is it becomes direct service to the spiritual master. It is as good as Prabhupada directly calling you and telling, this is your service, please do it. So, the, it all depends on the extent of surrender that we, that we are having towards Srila Prabhupada. That is the whole point. So, it's as simple as that.

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of whether only full-time devotees can achieve Krishna consciousness, arguing that it's possible regardless of one's material circumstances, using Bhaktivinoda Thakur as an example.

This is the question: In Kali Yuga, is it only possible for a full-time devotee to attain Krishna consciousness until death, where we can remember Krishna at the time of death? That's not true. The point is that if we look at the example of great Acharyas like Bhaktivinoda Thakur, he was engaged in government service, but still he was Krishna conscious. Of course, he is a pure devotee, he is a great Acharya, we cannot compare with our own condition. But Bhaktivinoda Thakur, by his example, he established that no matter what condition we are in, we can

**Key Quote:** "Whatever we do, we have to surrender to Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing the importance of surrendering all activities to Krishna, regardless of one's material status or engagement, as activity is inherent to the soul.

become Krishna conscious. We can remain in pure devotional service irrespective of what material engagement we have. So Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita, yad karośi, yad aśnāsi, yad juhośi, dadāsi, yad tapasya sikaunte, yad kurusva madharpanam, whatever we do, we have to surrender to Krishna. And that's why we have to give up our devotional service. Sthane sthitaha. Sthane sthitaha, wherever, whatever material situation we are in, we need not give it up. If we are able to give it up and dedicate ourselves fully to our spiritual master's mission, that's the best thing, definitely. But if due to some commitments, some considerations, some opposition, we are unable to dedicate ourselves, still in whatever condition we have, it's not possible to give up. So we are not able to give up our devotional service, we are not able to give up our spiritual service, we are in, we can render devotion and service to Krishna, we can remain Krishna conscious, and at the time of death, by the mercy of the Guru, by the mercy of a pure devotee, spiritual master, which is Srila Prabhupada, by his mercy we will be able to remember Krishna and go back to Godhead. So remembering Krishna at the time of death and going back to Godhead is not dependent upon my status. My status as a full-time devotee, congregation devotee, folk devotee, Grihastha, Brahmachari, Sanyasi, these are all material considerations, material situations. According to our body, according to the circumstances, we may take up a certain status or position in life because everyone has to have some, the material world is such that you have to have some status. Either as a man or as a woman. Either as a married person or as a bachelor or as a full-time devotee or working outside. You have to do something.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When we start attributing the result to ourselves, then you are on the material platform."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while activity is essential, attributing the results of actions to oneself keeps one on the material platform, and receiving the mercy of Guru and Krishna is what truly matters for liberation.

Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that the nature of the living entity is to be active. And therefore Krishna says, "You cannot remain inactive because if you are inactive you cannot even maintain your body." So activity is the characteristic of the soul; the soul cannot remain inactive. Now, in what capacity he acts in the material world, as a Brahmachari, as a Grihastha, as a folk boy, as a congregation devotee, as a full-time missionary, whatever activities you do, in whatever condition, you have to situate yourself somewhere and carry out some activity. You cannot remain inactive. The point is, what do we do with the result of those activities? If I am a full-time missionary, then I cannot remain inactive. If I am a full-time missionary, but I am thinking, "Oh, this activity I am doing, because of this so much, this one result is coming is all because I have worked hard for it. I worked hard, therefore so much donation came to the temple. I worked hard, so many people became devotees of Krishna." When we start attributing the result to ourselves, then you are on the material platform. So, to whom do we attribute the result? No matter in what condition we are in, no matter what status we are in, no matter what is our field of activity, that actually determines whether we receive the mercy of Guru and Krishna and we are able to remember Krishna at the time of death and we are able to become free from the cycle of birth and death and go back to Krishna Loka or not.

**Key Quote:** "It is the consciousness of that individual which determines whether it goes back to Godhead or not."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes that while being a full-time devotee is conducive to Krishna consciousness, ultimately it is one's consciousness and surrender to Krishna that determines whether one returns to Godhead.

So it's not a matter of being a full-time devotee or not, it's a matter of receiving the mercy of Guru and Krishna. Guru is Srila Prabhupada and Krishna himself. And if we have the opportunity and the chance to dedicate ourselves to Krishna, our life, to Prabhupada's mission, to our Guru Maharaj's mission, then there is a very high degree of chance that every activity that we do, we will be able to surrender the result to Krishna. So the situation becomes more favorable when we are a full-time devotee, but ultimately it is the consciousness of that individual which determines whether it goes back to Godhead or not. So this is the fundamental point which we have to always keep in mind. Otherwise, being a full-time missionary, yes, is more definitely far more conducive to be able to practice Krishna consciousness and to be able to come to the point of remembering Krishna all the time, which will help us to remember Krishna even at the time of death and take us back to Godhead.

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of whether modern science accepts reincarnation, stating that opinions vary among scientists and that belief in science doesn't preclude belief in God, as they are different fields of knowledge.

I believe in reincarnation. Does modern science accept it or not? Modern science, well, it ranges from 0 to 100. There are people in science who don't believe in reincarnation. There are people who believe somewhere in between. There are people who believe totally in reincarnation. So we have all kinds of people. It's not that if you are a believer in science, you cannot be a believer in God. It's not like that, because both are different branches of knowledge. It's like asking, does someone who believes in physics really believe in mathematics? Or someone who believes in mathematics really believe in biology? Both are different branches of knowledge, so you cannot compare both of them. But yes, there are people who believe in God. There are people who believe in science who don't believe in reincarnation, don't believe in the existence of soul, etc. And there are many scientists, Nobel laureates, those who have achieved a lot in the field of chemistry, science, physics, etc. There are many people like that who believe that there must be a higher being behind this creation. There must be a higher intelligence behind this creation.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "And all the living entities are trying to control the material energy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of material and spiritual energies according to the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting the distinction between matter and the living entity that seeks to control it.

So we go by, see, the point is that science deals with matter, material energy. According to the understanding of the Bhagavad Gita, Apareyam itas tv anyam prakritim viddhi me param, Krishna says, First of all, there is, First of all, Krishna says, there is one energy of his, which is called the differentiated energy or the interior energy. And this interior energy of Krishna, it consists of earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intelligence and falsity. These eight elements constitute the interior energy of Krishna. Apareyam itas tv anyam prakritim viddhi me param jiva-bhutam maha-baho yedam dharyate jagat. And then Krishna says, the entire material energy that we see comprises different combinations of these eight elements. Whether you look at a human body, animal body, tree body, earth, planets, different planets, all of them comprise these fundamental eight elements in varying proportions, varying forms, etc. But Krishna says, beyond this, there is a higher energy, superior energy of mind, which is called the living entity, jiva-bhutam yedam dharyate jagat. And all the living entities are trying to control the material energy. You see how Krishna has beautifully put it. If you analyze this material, entire material manifestation also, you have matter, which is what scientists are all studying. Then there is the scientist who studies that matter, who wants to control all that matter by studying it. There are two distinct things, isn't it? One is matter itself. Then there is the person who is trying to harness material energy, control it, use it according to his purposes.

**Key Quote:** "They say that no, living force is also part of the material energy. Some point of time, when the chemicals mix together, consciousness is produced."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the scientific view that consciousness arises from material interactions and contrasts it with the Vedic perspective, using the example of AI development to illustrate the point.

So Krishna brings this distinction out, and he says, both of them are different energies. Even the living entity is also energy of Krishna. Many scientists, of course, they do not accept that living force is a separate energy. They say that no, living force is also part of the material energy. Some point of time, when the chemicals mix together, consciousness is produced. That's all. And so that's why they are saying very quickly, we will produce sentient AI. And once we are there, we have produced life. Okay. Sentient AI already to some extent, they have already done. If you look at, if you go to Google, there is an option, Google Lens. You take a picture of something and put it into Google. It will search and bring out all the information related to it. Just the other day, somebody was asking us, if you see next to our compound wall, there are a lot of trees. There are those big, big fruits coming from the tree hanging down. So somebody asked, there must be some use for this fruit. So much of it is hanging down. Why are you not using it? So I immediately pulled out my mobile, took a picture and searched and found out that the fruit is poisonous, so you cannot use it. So I said, see, it is here. So you see, vision, form, identifying form. Our sight is what? Our power of sight is to identify forms and to be able to discriminate and determine. Okay. This form belongs to that of a speaker. This is the form of a fan. This is the form of a TV. We see the form and identify what the object is, what its functions are, right? Similarly, AI is doing that. You capture a photograph. It will give you all information, what it is all about. So power of sight is already there, right? And power of sound is already there. Now, latest thing is you hum a tune. Some song is running in your mind. You are remembering the tune, but you have forgotten the song. You hum a tune into your mobile and search, it will search out that song and tell you. I don't know whether you have used that feature. So even sound, it is able to, and also we are able to see that Siri and in Google also, there is one lady. You speak to her and tell, call this person. It will immediately, she will immediately call. You ask for directions, she will show from where to where, how to go. So sound also is recognizing. And you can dictate. Now it has become part of all softwares. Word, MS word you open, olden days we had to sit and type. Now we are all from that dinosaur age. So we are, you know, automatically tuned to open a word file and start typing. But now you don't have to do that. Open a word file and start dictating, whichever language you want. You dictate in Tamil, it will type in Tamil. You dictate in Hindi, it will type in Hindi. You dictate in English, it will type in English. So sound also it has got recognized.

**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing AI, focusing on the senses it lacks and arguing that even sentient AI cannot replicate human consciousness, free will, or the ability to discriminate between right and wrong.

So AI, now what is pending in AI? One is smell, and second is touch, right? And so we have sight, taste, smell, taste, sound, taste, smell, taste, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, taste, taste, and touch. These are the three things AI still not done, and they will reach there also. You take one specific agarbatti, light it and bring it near the sensor. It will identify and tell you which fragrance it is. So that also they may be able to do it. If at all it is just a sensor that you have to develop. Similarly, taste also. I don't know how they are going to do it. Feed a rasgulla to that AI and it will tell you what has been noticed. Eat. Do not do anything. Eat. Don't ask for sleeping habit. You what the taste it is eventually it may be possible to do that also but by so you have you have developed a sentient AC AI already partially a is sentient if you bring in these three more senses than fully sentient air but does that constitute a conscious living being capable of taking decisions processing desires processing the power of discrimination differentiating what is the right and wrong those things will not exist whatever you the way you program that AI it will respond accordingly somebody has has you know inputted into the air program the AI to give all atheistic responses we wait these things somebody some Krishna conscious devotee if he makes an AI to give all Krishna conscious answers possible no we all know how AI works now it's all biased there's no non biased AI so it will have no what do you say it has no intention or desire of its own whereas a human being possesses those faculties so desiring consciousness

**Summary:** The speaker argues that AI, being an imitation created by intelligent beings, cannot prove that original life arose spontaneously from chemicals, emphasizing the need for intelligence in creation.

decision-making, these cannot be replicated by AI. So you can call it sentient AI, but it is still artificial intelligence. It's not going beyond that. So you see people get carried away by this kind of imitations. After all, ultimately what is the experience? It is imitating, mimicking human intelligence, that's all, you know. So we are using our human intelligence and mimicking, imitating original intelligence. So AI is created, you did not come up with that. That is no off佐 so we all gotta communicate Napoleon about it that is looping in the air modificationsμε is created by us, it is created by an intelligent human being. So to create an imitation, you need a living person. So how can you say that the original has come into existence on its own, that it has come about just by a combination of chemicals? So AI also you, you know, allow chemicals to combine and form AI. Why it is not happening? It will not happen. So you see, anything that we have to create requires intelligence. Creating some meaningful object cannot happen without intelligence. Some by chance some chemicals came together and created a beautiful object, not possible. So meaningful objects can be created only when you have a person behind it, and that person cannot be created by a combination of chemicals. So the person is beyond the ordinary or intelligent physical form

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the Vedic perspective of distinct material and spiritual energies, highlighting the superiority of spiritual energy due to its consciousness and the easily observable difference between a living person and a dead body.

called material energy. This is the way the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedic scriptures approach the world around us, that there are two distinct separate energies. Both are energies. One is material energy, another is spiritual energy. Spiritual energy is superior because it is trying to control and manipulate the inferior material energy. Why is one called the inferior and the other called superior? Because the superior energy has got the controlling tendency and manipulating tendency, whereas the other energy does not have. The spiritual energy, the superior energy has consciousness, therefore it is superior. Material energy cannot possess consciousness at any point of time, therefore it is inferior. So this is how we have to see distinctly, you know, any person with common sense can make out this distinction. There is a distinct difference between a living person and dead matter. And that is why very simple example, as long as we are alive, we look at each other and call each other by names. We go to a hospital, they will ask for the medical record and they will say so and so person is getting treated here and all that. And suppose a person goes to the hospital and he dies in the hospital. What happens? The doctor will come and tell, please take the dead body and go. They will not tell the name of the person because no more, that person is no more, that person is gone. Only body has been left behind. Very simple, no, what is the difference between a living person and a dead body? It is the person who is there within the body. So it's very common sense. It doesn't require much, very great intelligence

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes scientists who are blinded by the allure of material advancements, preventing them from seeing the simple truth of reincarnation and the limitations of material explanations for life.

to understand this. But unfortunately, scientists, although they are apparently very intelligent, they are not able to see even this simple truth. That is why Krishna refers to them in the Bhagavad Gita as mayaya apahrta-jnana. Their knowledge has been snatched away by the glamour, the glitter of material energy. They will invent one AI and they will say, we are almost there. We are going to create sentient air. We have, we have figured out how to create light. And they go on like this, like this. They will, you know, they will die. Their sons will come. They will also die. Their grandchildren will come. They will also die. Each of them will keep telling the people of their generation, we are almost there. We have figured it out. Don't worry. And life will go on. Death will go on. Business of science will also go on like this. So we should not get carried away by the glitter of the material energy. That's the whole thing. If you are carried away by the glitter of material energy, how much science and technology has had to do with it, how much science has advanced, what all discoveries have happened. So when you look at all those things, yes, we will be able to figure out what are the chemicals bringing about consciousness and life. This is how maya covers the intelligence of the living entity. This is called the avarana-atmika shakti of maya. Material energy, although it is inferior, it has the ability to blind us with her glitter, promising something in the future. In the future, we are going to find out. In the future, we are going to be able to create, recreate life. So these kinds of false assurances are given to us by maya which covers our intelligence and we are unable to see the simple stark reality.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by stating that some scientists, less influenced by illusion, can recognize the existence of God and a higher intelligence beyond human efforts, acknowledging the diversity of beliefs within the scientific community.

This is what the Vedic scriptures are pointing out. So it doesn't matter. Amongst the scientists, those who are mayapahrta-jnana, their intelligence has been stolen away by maya, will not be able to see how reincarnation is happening. Whereas those who are not completely bewildered by that illusory energy will be able to see the truth. That's why among scientists, you will see some of them are definitely, they believe in God. There are many others who don't believe in God. So many scientists will say, religion is all not required. We should remove religion. And there in his row, one scientist will be releasing one satellite and before that he'll be going and doing one Ganesha puja. So you have both varieties, because ultimately human beings, human beings, some people whose intelligence is not so much covered will be able to see that beyond our efforts and beyond our intelligence, there is a higher intelligence and we are dependent on that. So that's how things are.

## AAQ: How do we not Overthink, Over Analyze | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

### faith, knowledge, science, scripture

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Faith is common for any acquisition of knowledge, whether biology, botany, chemistry, physics, mathematics, any branch of knowledge if you want to acquire, faith is common."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of overthinking and argues that faith is essential for acquiring any knowledge, including scientific knowledge, drawing parallels between accepting scientific principles and accepting scriptural teachings.

Interesting question. How do we not overthink or overanalyze? How to avoid overthinking and overanalyzing? Well, if we look at the Vedic scriptures, if we look at the Bhagavad Gita, faith is given a very important role to play in acquisition of knowledge. Now of course, in the modern day, faith is given a very, you know, it is treated as a very contemptuous thing. All religions are all fakes. Leave it aside. Science is real knowledge. That's the way it is presented. It is true that to acquire spiritual knowledge, you need faith. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that ashraddha dana, those who are unfaithful, those who do not have faith, they will have neither peace in this life nor in the next one. So to be able to acquire spiritual knowledge, faith is very important. But then to acquire science also faith is required. All of us, we learn science. How? By going to the school and college, sitting in a classroom and studying the textbook. Whatever the textbook is teaching, we accept it as truth. We say to water, consciousness, there are two molecules of water. All of us have done it. How many of you have actually taken out water and analyzed how many atoms of hydrogen, how many atoms of oxygen are there? How many of you have done it? None of us have done it. True, no? But if anybody asks any one of us, what is the composition of water? What is the chemical composition of water? H2O. Immediately answer will come. Where did you get this H2O from? What is hydrogen in the first place? What is oxygen? Oxygen, can you separate it out and show it to me? If you can you show it to me, where is oxygen? Show me. Can you show me? Not possible. Can you show me hydrogen? Not possible. Can you show me God? Not possible. So can you show me God? I cannot show you God because you cannot see. So God does not exist. You cannot show me hydrogen, how should I accept that hydrogen exists? You are telling periodic table you are showing and all those things. Very fine. All right. That table anybody can make. Even a child can sit and make. So just because you made it and you put it in the textbook, I have to accept. So when you teach from a book, we have to accept it blindly. I have faith. This is a science book. Accept it. That's all. When it comes to same Bhagavad Gita, that is also a book. No, no, no, it is faith. Faith is common for any acquisition of knowledge, whether biology, botany, chemistry,

**Key Quote:** "So that faith in an authorized source of knowledge is essential for acquiring knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of having faith in an authorized source of knowledge, comparing the process of learning science from authorized textbooks and professors to acquiring spiritual knowledge from authorized scriptures.

physics, mathematics, any branch of knowledge if you want to acquire, faith is common. But not blind faith. Faith in an authorized source of that knowledge. Why we have faith in the science books? Because the science books are being taught in an authorized college, by an authorized professor. We are not going to some sabjeevala and learning what is the components of water, what is the chemical composition of water. We are not going to some street vendor who is illiterate and learning from him, right? We are going to an authorized college and authorized professor and authorized textbooks we are studying and we are learning from that. So that faith in an authorized source of knowledge is essential for acquiring knowledge. So that faith in an authorized source of knowledge is essential for acquiring knowledge. Any branch of knowledge without that faith, fundamental faith, nobody can acquire any knowledge. This is the reality. So, similarly, in for acquiring spiritual knowledge also, you have to have faith in the authorized source of that spiritual knowledge. So, just like we have textbooks which are prescribed by the university which are called authorized sources of knowledge, material knowledge, But similarly, for acquiring spiritual knowledge, the authorized books are Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures. So if we acquire knowledge from them, we will be able to, we will, if we have faith in those authorized books of spiritual knowledge, we will be able to acquire spiritual knowledge. And just like in the science books, first you have faith in the college and the teacher and the textbook, go and sit in the classroom, hear the theory, then you go to the lab and conduct the experiment. You will be able to see for yourself how the theory is correct, yes or no? But for you to conduct that experiment also, first you should have faith that yes, college is authorized, textbook is authorized, this knowledge being taught to me is authorized. If you have no faith, hey, this is all bogus, yeah, you will never acquire any knowledge. So with that faith, you first go and learn the theory. Then you go to the lab and do the practical experiments. Then whatever you learned in theory gets validated, our faith in that source of knowledge becomes stronger. This is the phenomenon which is working in science also.

**Key Quote:** "You have faith in the authorized scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, and you study that and apply those principles in your life, you will be able to see the results which are predicted."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that just as scientific theories are validated through experiments, spiritual knowledge is validated by applying scriptural principles in one's life, leading to stronger faith.

Same thing, same principle works even for spiritual knowledge also. You have faith in the authorized scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, and you study that and apply those principles in your life, you will be able to see the results which are predicted. In the end, you will be able to see the results which are predicted in the Bhagavad Gita and in the Vedic scriptures. And if you do that, so what happens? You are validating, you are applying the principles, practically you are applying them in the laboratory of your life. In the, to study science, the laboratory for you is some classroom within the college or school. In the case of spiritual knowledge, the laboratory is yours. You apply, you experiment. By applying those spiritual principles in your life, you will be able to see the results. You are validating, you are doing studies according to those spiritual principles in your life, and you validate whatever is told in the Vedic scriptures, that way your faith grows. So, when we speak of any branch of knowledge, we need to have faith in that branch of knowledge. Without that, we cannot acquire any system of knowledge. So, when we speak of overthinking or overthinking, then it is not worth knowing the knowledge at all. One must never wax and notice Hay жеä président intrigued and known all his deviations andmm eternal. One must never lose attention to knowledge all the time. Without it, one cannot, we cannot acquire any system of knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "So the root cause of overthinking and over analysis is what lack of sufficient faith."
**Summary:** The speaker connects overthinking and overanalyzing to a lack of faith in the source of knowledge, suggesting that once the authenticity of a source is established, its teachings should be accepted.

Stanugen was an lett definition of artificial intelligence. analyzing what it simply means is we are not having sufficient faith in the source of knowledge so if you have faith in that source of knowledge if you have done a little bit of analysis and determined for yourself that yes i accept that this is a bona fide source of knowledge then you don't after that analyze whether this source what the source is saying is correct or not you accept that whatever is coming from the thoughts is correct so then we have we become free from overthinking and over analyzing but if all our life we keep questioning the source then we will never be able to acquire knowledge same thing you go to college first you determine college has certain registration accreditation it has got a recognition you analyze all those things and then you look at who are the professors what are their qualifications and how many years they have been teaching so you analyze all this and come to a conclusion yes this college is authorized after that you get into the college admit yourself in the college then whatever they teach you have to accept this accept it as school right now after admission three years you are in the college still you are researching is this college authorized or not and then why are in the college via this is called over analysis and working so we have to learn to place faith after an initial assessment of the of the authenticity of the source of our knowledge once we have determined that this source of knowledge is authentic whatever comes from there we have to accept it as

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the need to obtain spiritual knowledge from the right source, referring to the disciplic succession stemming from Krishna as presented in the Bhagavad Gita.

then we will become free from overthinking and over analysis so the root cause of overthinking and over analysis is what lack of sufficient faith so we have to learn to develop faith if we and that development of faith comes from the determination of the authenticity of the source of knowledge so therefore it is important that is why krishna also tells in the bhagavad-gita attaining this spiritual knowledge should be obtained from the right source what is the right source right source is how do you determine what is the right source for spiritual knowledge that has to come in a bona fide parampara and that is why prabhupada has given him towards the end of the introduction of the bhagavad-gita the unbroken chain of discipleship succession stemming from krishna himself krishna gave this knowledge to brahma brahma gave it to narada narada gave to vyasa dev vyasa dev gave it to madhavacharya like that prabhupada is the 32nd in the line of discipleship success like that prabhupada is the 32nd in the line of disciples so the criterion for the criterion for reposing our faith in the source of knowledge is given in the Bhagavad Gita and we use that criterion and we repose our faith in the Bhagavad Gita and then we will be able to take advantage of the knowledge in that.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So, devotional life, Bhakti Yoga is such that it is the means as well as the end."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that in spiritual life, the long-term and short-term goal is the same: service to Krishna and Vaishnavas through chanting and serving Prabhupada's mission, emphasizing that devotional service is both the means and the end.

How can I achieve my long-term and short-term goal through spiritual practice? This is the next question. You see, now it all depends on what is your goal. Is your goal material or is it spiritual? If it is spiritual, how to achieve your long-term and short-term goals? Long-term and short-term goal in spiritual life is only one: service to Krishna and service to Vaishnavas. So, we chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. We serve the mission of Prabhupada. That's the short-term as well as long-term goal. Life after life, we want to be engaged in the service of the mission of Srila Prabhupada. Life after life, we want Srila Prabhupada as our Diksha Guru and want to follow his instructions. And we want to chant Hare Krishna. We want to never forget Krishna's holy name. This is the short-term goal. This is the long-term goal. So, devotional life, Bhakti Yoga is such that it is the means as well as the end. The means to perfect yourself spiritually, to achieve spiritual perfection in Bhakti Yoga is to chant Hare Krishna. And after perfection, what is it that you are going to do? What is it that you are going to achieve? You will chant Hare Krishna. That's all. So, devotional service is both the means as well as the end.

**Key Quote:** "Because human life is not meant to work towards results."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts spiritual goals with material goals, arguing that focusing solely on achieving material results is a regressive way of thinking, leading away from the true purpose of human life.

Now, if you are talking about material goals, short-term, long-term goals, how to achieve through spiritual practice? Well, you see, this focus on achieving a certain goal, first have a goal in life, work towards it, achieve it. This is a very recent and very, what you say, regressive kind of thinking in the human society. It's not a progressive thinking. Why regressive? Because when we speak of goal, that means we have to have a result in mind. What is it that I want to achieve? So, all your activities become result-oriented. All your decisions in life will be result-oriented. Today's world people say, yes, we have to be result-oriented. Yes, that is the way to me. We have to focus. We have to have a goal. We have to work towards it, hard work, etc. But according to the Vedic scriptures, it is not a progressive way of life. Because if we focus too much on the goal that we want to achieve, we will be slipping from the human form of life into animal form of life and lower species of life.

**Key Quote:** "Better than working towards the result is to work for duty."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of duty over being result-oriented, stating that Vedic civilization prioritizes performing one's duty above achieving specific goals.

Because human life is not meant to work towards results. Better than working towards the result is to work for duty. That we also know in the material world. I mean, even in today's society, little bit of still, there is some respect for duty. Somebody wants to achieve a certain goal. I want to make a lot of money. And he doesn't take care of his parents. He doesn't bother about his family. Only focuses on to earn money. What will you say? He is a good guy? Isn't it? He should take care of his parents. Okay, we can have a goal. But some things are there. Some duties are there. You cannot give up. How can you give up your parents? How can you give up your family? So, you see, having a duty is considered higher than simply working for a goal. So, in the Vedic civilization, focus is not on the goal or on the result you are going to achieve.

### duty, teacher, Guru Dakshina, Vedic times

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Focus is on doing one's duty."
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the concept of duty in Vedic times through the example of teachers who prioritized imparting knowledge based on a student's qualification and character rather than monetary compensation, highlighting the importance of Guru Dakshina as an expression of gratitude.

Focus is on doing one's duty. The best example of this is Dronacharya. Dronacharya was a teacher. And his duty was to teach any eligible, qualified candidate if he comes. That's the duty of the teacher to teach. And in the Vedic times, teachers would not work for money. They would not say, give me a certain piece, then I will teach you. Today's world, teaching means only qualification required is you have to have money to pay the teacher. You have money to pay the teacher, college, whatever, you will get educated. That's the only thing. No other consideration is there. But in the Vedic times, money was never in the picture. The teacher will never ask for money. Teacher will assess, is the student qualified to receive this knowledge and will he use this knowledge properly. If yes, then the teacher will teach him even if he doesn't get any fees in return. And after receiving the knowledge, the student will not just walk away. Today's world, what others? Go to college, get educated, convocation will be there, go, take a degree, walk out after that, you are not bothered. You will not even remember the name of your teacher. But in the Vedic times, it is not like that. If you have received knowledge, then the student at the end of it, although teacher is not asking for any fees, it is the duty of the disciple to give some Guru Dakshina. Dakshina means it is whatever it is possible for you, you give. It is not a fee. It is a Dakshina. From my side, I am giving according to what level of gratitude I feel and what is possible for me, what is my capacity, I am giving. So it is Guru Dakshina. So the student has to give. Guru Dakshina, he cannot come away empty handed. So the teacher also, whatever possible for you, give. I give like that.

**Key Quote:** "Dronacharya thought, what is my duty in this circumstance?"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Dronacharya teaching Drishtadyumna, who was destined to kill him, to exemplify the principle of performing one's duty impartially, even when faced with potential negative consequences.

So Dronacharya was approached by Drishtadyumna. Who is this Drishtadyumna? Drishtadyumna was the son of Drupada. And Drupada had some fight with Dronacharya. And Drupada had conducted a yajna to beget a son who would kill Drona. And that is how Drishtadyumna was born. So Drishtadyumna was born to kill Dronacharya. And this Drishtadyumna comes to Dronacharya and says, I want to learn the art of archery from you. I want to learn Dhanur Vidya from you. And what does Dronacharya do? Dronacharya says, yes, I will teach him. Dronacharya knows very well that Drishtadyumna is born to kill him. So if Dronacharya were to be result oriented, what he will think? If I teach him, what is the result? I will kill him. So I will not teach him. Correct knowledge. That is the common sense. Anybody in today's world, he will think like that. And you cannot fault him. But Dronacharya did not think like that. Dronacharya thought, what is my duty in this circumstance? I am a teacher. He is a qualified student seeking knowledge. I cannot deny him. I will teach him. So impartially he taught Drishtadyumna also along with the Pandavas and Kauravas. So duty.

**Key Quote:** "The higher than being a result oriented worker is to be a duty oriented worker."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Duryodhana's result-oriented approach with the Pandavas' duty-oriented approach in the Mahabharata, highlighting that the Kurukshetra war was a Dharma Yudha because the Pandavas followed Dharma while Duryodhana did not.

In Vedic civilization, duty was the foremost. If you look at Duryodhana, Duryodhana was result oriented. I want the kingdom. Somehow I have to get the kingdom. Either cheat, fight, do whatever, get the kingdom. Result oriented. Pandavas, duty oriented. We will do our duty. Whatever our duty requires of us, we will. Result is immaterial. So Duryodhana cheated and got the kingdom. Pandavas also could have cheated and kept the kingdom. But they said, no, we will not cheat. We will do our duty as a Kshatriya. We have lost the game of dice. We have won in Vannavasa and Ajnatavasa. We will do it. So they were like that. So in Vedic civilization, the whole fight of the Kurukshetra happened. Why? Because Duryodhana was result oriented. Pandavas were duty oriented. That is why it was a Dharma Yudha. Because Duryodhana was not following Dharma. Pandavas were following Dharma. So the higher than being a result oriented worker is to be a duty oriented worker.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Focus is not on the goal or on the result you are going to achieve."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that following duty according to Varnashrama Dharma and Sanatana Dharma is superior to simply fulfilling duties related to one's livelihood, emphasizing the importance of duties towards other living entities, Devatas, Rishis, and the performance of Yajna, Dana, and Tapasya.

And in duty oriented work also, following the duty according to the Varnashama Dharma, Sanatana Dharma given in the Vedic scriptures, that is even better than executing duty according to our understanding in today's world. I have to go to office on time. I have to work 8 hours. I have to do my whatever assigned tasks are there. That is one level of duty. But according to Varnashama Dharma, I have to situate myself in a particular Varna and Ashrama and perform those duties. Those duties are not limited only to the office work. The duties extend not only to one's office or one's vocation, one's livelihood, but also to the other living entities, to other human beings, to the Devatas, to the Rishis and Sages, to even the animals in the society like cows and dogs and bulls and horses which from all these animals will take so much service. So there are duties to perform towards them also. And over and above all this, Yajna, Dana and Tapasya. There are duties towards sacrifice for the Devatas and for Vishnu. Then there is Dana, charity. One has to compulsorily give charity. That is one of the duties. If you are earning money, it is not that you have to put it in your bank and you have to enjoy. No. You have to also give Dana. That is also a charity. Charity is also a duty. And Tapasya. Not only that. You also have to undertake certain austerities. Tapasyas. You have to fast on Ekadashi. You have to fast on Janmashtami. You have to follow certain Pratas. So certain Tapasyas are also built in. So all these duties, if somebody follows, that is higher than simply doing duty according to one's livelihood.

**Key Quote:** "Your only duty should be to serve Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Bhagavad Gita (18.66) to emphasize that the highest form of duty is to give up all other duties and exclusively serve Krishna and the spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada, without concern for personal liberation or destination.

That is even higher. Now out of all the people who perform duties, according to the Varnashrama Dharma, those who give up all those duties, and make it their only duties to serve Krishna exclusively, he is even higher. That is why Krishna tells in the end of the Bhagavad Gita, here in chapter 66 verse, sarva dharman parityajya: Give up all other duties. sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: Surrender unto only me. Your only duty should be to serve Krishna. So the person who makes it the goal of his life and the existence of his life, his duty of his life is only exclusively serving Krishna. Serving Krishna means serving the duty of the spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada. So a person who does this, he is the topmost. Even there also there is no goal. There is no goal that we have to achieve. I have to go back to the garden. I have to achieve liberation. I should go to Vaikuntha. None of those things should be there. My only goal is my duty which is to serve Krishna and my Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada. That's all. Where I go, how many births I will take, whether I get liberated or not, none of my consideration.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "That is where that sense of duty springs from."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the human form of life is unique because of the faculty to understand and perform duty, which involves self-restraint, sacrifice, and the willingness to do things that are not personally pleasing.

So that is the topmost. Development of the human intellect and human faculty. You can go up till there. Because only human beings have this faculty, you see, to think of duty. Animals have no sense of duty. That is why you don't have dharma for them. That you have to fast on Ekadashi. Can you go and tell your pet dog or pet cat, today is Ekadashi fast. You can forcibly make the cat or dog eat Ekadashi Prasastu. That's a difficult matter. But you know, it's not that the cat or dog is voluntarily following. No, we are voluntarily following. So that faculty to take tapasya, that faculty to sacrifice, that faculty to undertake certain austerities, the faculty to exercise self-restraint, is there only in the human form. So if you use that capability, that faculty in the human being, to do things which are not one's liking. I may like to do something, but I say, no, I will not do that. I will do something which is not very pleasing. If you ask me what I like to do, I like to eat when I feel hungry. But today is Janmasthami, I have to fast. So, although you would like to eat, you are ready to sacrifice that desire to eat and you are ready to fast. That faculty is there in the human being to do something, to give up something which you like to do and to do something which is not very pleasing. This faculty is there in the human being. And that is where that sense of duty springs from. In duty, what is there? Duty, you will do your duty even if it is not palatable, even if it is distressing. So, duty means you should be ready even if something, I have to do something, I have to do something which I don't like to do, I have to still do.

**Key Quote:** "That is the topmost development of the faculty."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the progression from basic duty to Varnashrama Dharma duty to exclusive service to Krishna and Guru as the highest development of human faculty, emphasizing that the ultimate goal is to serve the pleasure of Guru and Krishna without any other motivation.

That is called duty. So, you develop this faculty in the human being of self-restraint. You develop from the point of you know, doing your duty to doing varnashama dharma duty to rendering exclusive service to Krishna. That is the topmost development of the faculty. So, achieving long term, short term, goals is at the very bottom level. We have to progress far beyond that. We have to go to a certain level of sense of duty and in that also we have to go to duty towards varnashama dharma and finally duty towards guru and Krishna. That is the topmost decision. So, we should instead of thinking of short term, long term material goals, we should be thinking of when will I come to the stage where my only duty will be to serve Krishna and Guru. No other duty in my life. That is the real goal that we have to have. And how to achieve that? Very simple. Chant Hare Krishna, associate with devotees and render whatever practical devotional service you can. That chanting of Krishna's holy name and rendering service will gradually pull you towards that final destination of your devotional service, where you have no other motivation than to serve the pleasure of Guru and Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by encouraging listeners to chant Hare Krishna, associate with devotees, and render practical devotional service, explaining that the taste for Krishna will gradually lead them to the final destination of pure devotional service, emphasizing surrender to Krishna and Guru without concern for personal results.

So, rendering devotional service to Krishna is very powerful. We don't have to force ourselves. Oh no, I have to chant sixteen rounds. You don't have to do that. It's not a matter of force. We all begin, most of us, we begin by chanting one round, two rounds. Slowly we will make it four rounds. Slowly make it eight rounds. Then we will come to sixteen rounds. Isn't it? So, how does that happen? It's not that somebody is standing behind us with a stick. If you don't chant four rounds today, from today onwards I am going to beat you. Nobody did that. We automatically, we felt a taste for chanting. And we felt yes, I want to chant four rounds from today. Start chanting. So, the taste for Krishna is like that. Once you taste the devotional service, that devotional service will drag you until you come to the final point of your devotional service. So, simple thing. Read Prabhupada's books. Follow Prabhupada's instructions. Chant Hare Krishna. And you will achieve your long-term goal, which is to become a pure devotee of Krishna. That's the only result you can, you can desire. That also, it is dependent on the grace of Krishna and Buddha, whether they give award as pure devotional service or not. But as far as we are concerned, we want to serve our Guru's instructions and Krishna's instructions. That's a period. Whether we get Krishna Prema or not, whether I go to the spiritual world or not, whether I get liberated or not,

लो प्रो पोर्ग्राम I am for program आपका विद्धी वर्ष निश्चा ने आई था, बहुत कृपी रहा हुआ था, में वांट में आश्च रहा था, और इसमें उस स्थित्र के लिए आपके बाद बढ़ने बहुत रहा हुआ था. में एक बिल्ड थक गुड़ थे. ए, प्रभुजी, प्रभुजी. मैं कह दूसरा हूँ, वाला। क्या बिल्ड हूँ? आप वहां पहला पूंठते हैं। कूपका में बिल दे रहा है कि, हम उस संखित हल्पारों के बाद उसमें करने के लिए नहीं करने चाहिए। एक पटमा करना रखा गया था। एक योग उपसे बात करने की वजह नहीं जाना था। मेरे बास, हमें वह बहुत मुझे उपचार भूल्यया था। लेकिन शर्पद बिल्कुल नहीं बता सकता था। मेरी बहुत मास्ट पर एक पटमा ले गए। मैं बहुत खुश हूँ। किसी में मुझे देखेंगे, क्या हो जाएगा। दोस्तों, वहाँ देखेंगे, मोबाइल नहीं हुआ, किसी में पिक्चर देखेंगे और जोड़ेंगे। तो, आज वे वहाँ लिए आधे बजाएगी, आज आप नहीं कहेंगे। तो एक पारण में एक मैंसेज़ बढ़ाए गया। इन मुझे यहाँ पढ़ रहा था और मैं जब वहाँ पढ़ना चाहिए। उस परिणान कहा, उस चारे यहाँ पाठे जाएगा। I went, kept that in the corner, slowly started walking towards the door. Again, प्रभुजी, प्रभुजी! I said, now what? I said, where are you? He said, where are you going? There are so many more mats. I said, what, one mat is not enough? You want me to pick up more mats? अप्पा, it was such a, I tell you, it was a, you know, for my ego. Because all my life I have never done any menial work like that. Lived always like a prince, like a king, you know, there are always people to take care of washing the clothes and washing the dishes and all that. Never did any such thing in my life. So it was really, you know, it was really, it was like somebody is pushing me, very uncomfortable doing that and all that. But if that devotee had not done it that day, today I will not be sitting here. That's the reality. So I'm thankful to him that he broke through my false ego barrier and he pushed me to engage in service because of which today I'm here.

**Key Quote:** "So Maya will use false ego and tell us, why you are to do all these things? This is not meant for you. You are supposed to live like a king."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that false ego, influenced by Maya, prevents us from engaging in joyful service to Krishna, and that overcoming this requires pushing beyond our comfort zone with the help of other devotees.

So reality is, what is preventing us from rendering service to Krishna? Why are we feeling reluctant? Why are we feeling burdensome? Krishna actually says in the ninth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, सुसुकं कर्तुं अभ्ययं Devotional service to Krishna is very joyfully performed. So then if it is joyfully performed, when picking up the mat, why am I feeling so much, discomfort, so much embarrassment? Because false ego. Maya doesn't want us to engage in service to Krishna. Because if we engage in service, we'll get out of our clutches. So Maya will use false ego and tell us, why you are to do all these things? This is not meant for you. You are supposed to live like a king. What is all this, you know, picking up the mat, wiping the floor? No, no, no, no, no, no. These are all burdens. And you are engaging in spiritual life for this. I mean, you are an engineer, you have studied in so much, this one big college, you have got so much rank, this, that, and all that. All that for this? So these are the thoughts that will come to your mind and which will inhibit you, which will discourage you from doing service to Krishna. So at that time, some devotee has to come and push you. Baba, do know. So little by little, little by little, that barrier gets broken, broken, broken, broken. What will happen is eventually we'll become comfortable. We'll go beyond comfortable. We'll start loving to do that service. So this is how we have to be ready to go beyond our comfort zone. Then only we can expect to progress. No pain, no gain. The pain that you have to take in Krishna consciousness is the pain of overcoming our false ego, which always advises us against rendering service to Krishna. So therefore, if somebody is pushing you into services, you should not develop grudge against that devotee. You should be grateful to that devotee. You see my false ego, Maya is so strongly preventing me from doing service, but this devotee so mercifully, is pushing me to engage in service to Krishna. That is the way we should look at it.

### subtle body, reincarnation, mind-body connection

**Key Quote:** "Mind, intelligence and false ego transfers us to another body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the process of reincarnation, emphasizing the role of the subtle body (mind, intelligence, and false ego) in carrying the soul to the next body.

So Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita that, within this very life, you can see that we are changing so many bodies. I gave up the body of a baby, got the body of a child, gave up the body of the child, got the body of a youth, gave up the body of the youth, got an old body, got a new body, got an old person's body, and finally when death comes, I will give up this body. So logically speaking, when in this life I have changed so many bodies, but I continue to exist. I didn't cease to exist. Body of the baby finished means I was not finished, I continued, right? So same logic, if you extrapolate, at the time of death, this body will cease to be, I will go on to another body. So when death comes, what happens? We are taken by our subtle body. Mind, intelligence, and false ego transfers us to another body. Actually, that's what has happened to us in this life also. When the body of the baby went away and we got the body of the child, we continue to feel I am the same person. And when we get a youthful body, we continue to feel I am the same person, although the body of the child and the baby is not there. Why? Because the same subtle body is continuing. Same mind, intelligence, and false ego is continuing. That is continuing uninterrupted. So for me, that feeling of I, I am this, doesn't cease. So we don't feel that I am changing the body, because although the gross body is changing, the subtle body is not changing. So the subtle body carries us from the body of the baby to the body of the child to the body of the youth to the body of the old person. Similarly, the subtle body will carry us from this body to the next body. So this cycle of birth and death goes on.

**Key Quote:** "Whenever a person is born, 100% guaranteed that that person will die."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the inevitability and painful nature of both birth and death, highlighting that both experiences are filled with suffering.

So Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita, jātasya dhruva mṛtyur. Whenever a person is born, 100% guaranteed that that person will die. Yes or no? Everybody accepts this. And Krishna says the reverse is also true. Jātasya dhruva mṛtyur janma mṛtasya ca. When a person dies, it is guaranteed that he is going to take another birth. So we are all caught up in this cycle of repeated birth and death. It's not a pleasurable thing to undergo birth and death. Death is a very, very painful experience. That's why nobody wants to die. Even an animal understands this. So if somebody, if a human being says, what is there? Death, you know, it's not a big thing. I am not afraid of death. That means he is duller than an animal. Even an animal understands death is very painful. That's why you try to cut the throat of an animal, it will shout, it will shriek, it will scream, it will try to run away. It will not give up so easily because even an animal knows death is very painful. So death is a very painful thing. Similarly, birth is also very painful. How are all of us born? We are all born crying, no? None of us are born, ahahaha, you know, laughing, you know, I had a wonderful experience, so joyful to take birth. Nobody takes birth like that, right? Everybody takes birth crying. It's extremely painful experience. The pain is so great. It's so painful, the process of birth.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the suffering inherent in the cycle of birth and death, including old age and disease.

And if you say, okay, momentarily, I have to undergo some pain for nine months, 10 months, I'm in the mother's womb, painful, but after I come out, over, no pain. And death, few seconds, it will be over. Okay. So, you know, birth, when I took birth, some pain I underwent, some suffering I underwent, 100 years I lived, happy. And at the end of my life, I was happy. And at the end of 100 years, death came, I had to struggle a little bit, no problem. No, sir, in between birth and death, two more things are there, old age and disease. That is also painful, no? One small fever comes also, it will be so depressing for us. We have to take medication, body will ache, there will be headache, eyes will be burning, nose will be burning. So many problems. We will not be able to digest proper food. Taste will go away. So it's painful. Disease is painful. And old age is also painful. All the joints will ache, there will be no energy in the body, you will not be able to walk, you cannot sit down, you cannot walk properly. So much trouble.

**Key Quote:** "So you see, in the midst of this birth and death, so many miseries we have to undergo."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the threefold miseries (adhibhautika, adhidaivika, and adhyatmika kleshas) that cause suffering in the material world.

And as if these four things are not enough, there are also three kinds of kleshas, adhibhautika klesha, adhidaivika klesha, and adhyakmika klesha. Adhidaivika klesha. Excessive redness. It is hair. Headaches. Empty brains. Floods. You built a house with great difficulty. You earned a lot of money, you did hard work, built a house, one flood will come, everything is swept away. Gone. Nobody has control over this. Supernatural occurrences. Distress, miseries which come on account of supernatural forces. Floods, earthquakes, extreme heat during summer, extreme cold during winter, all these things will create problems for us. Okay, all the rainy season got over, weather has become very nice and you know October, November season very, very pleasant weather. So things have become peaceful. No Adi Bhavathika Klesa. Immediately what will happen? There will be Adi Daivika Klesa is not there. Adi Bhavathika Klesa will start. Trump will announce H1B visa, $100,000 you have to pay and he will say 50% tariff I am putting exactly when Diwali is starting. So all your festival mood is all dampened. Arrey, I did not do anything to Trump. Why is he putting tariff on me? So other living entities will cause problems for you. And you will see when it is extreme heat during summer or extreme cold during winter, what will happen? You will be troubled by winter. The heat and the cold of the winter but there will be no mosquitoes. Weather becomes very good, immediately mosquitoes will start. One problem goes another will come. Adi Bhavathika Klesa. Other living entities will come and trouble us for no reason, for no fault of ours. And then there is Adhyatmika Klesa. Everything is fine, but my own mind will give me trouble. I will become depressed for no reason. Mood is not good today. I feel very grumpy today. You cannot help it, isn't it? Everybody around you is happy. You alone are feeling very, you know, very foul mood today. So everybody will start avoiding it. Today's mood is not okay. Don't go near it.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that understanding Krishna's transcendental nature can liberate one from the cycle of birth and death, leading to Krishna's abode.

and death, so many miseries we have to undergo. So an intelligent person will question, how can I get out of this cycle of birth and death and disease, old age, and these threefold miseries? What should I do? So if you want to do that, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, janma karma chamedivyam evam yojanati tatvatah, tyaktvadeham punarjanma naiti mameti sorjuna. Krishna says that if a soul takes the trouble to understand the position of Krishna, that Krishna, his birth, his activities, his qualities, these are all not material. Krishna's birth is not like my birth. Krishna doesn't have to undergo old age and disease like me. Krishna doesn't have to undergo Adhyatmika klesha, Adibhavitika klesha, Adidaivika klesha. Krishna is beyond all this. Simply to understand that Krishna is transcendent, his activities are transcendental, his birth is transcendental, his every quality is transcendental, simply by understanding this, Krishna says, punarjanma naiti, you don't have to take repeated birth and death in this material world. Then what will happen to us? Mameti, Krishna says, we will go to Krishna, we will go to Krishna loka. Just like we all live on this earth planet, Krishna has his own home, which is called Goloka Vrindavan. We will go there.

## AAQ: Is Evil The Highest Ignorance? Does It Have a Form? | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

**Key Quote:** "The standard of what is evil, what is not evil, what is good, what is bad, all these things keep changing with time."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of whether evil is the highest degree of ignorance and argues that the definition of good and evil changes with time and societal norms, using examples like alcohol consumption and premarital relationships.

Is evil the highest degree of ignorance? Does evil have a personified form? Well, what constitutes being evil? We may have different concepts of what is evil and what is good. In the olden times, in the Vedic times, to consume alcohol, to have an illicit relationship outside of marriage between a man and a woman, this was considered sinful. To engage in gambling was considered sinful. Today the definition has changed. Man and woman, outside of marriage, they have a relationship, consensual, it's all fine. Who are we to interfere? It is their private matter. We see online so many betting apps and betting channels and so many things are going on. Even online, openly it is all being advertised. Come and play and gamble. Intoxication, I mean, who doesn't intoxicate now? So today all these things are not considered sinful. They are all considered normal, that's part of normal life. So, the standard of what is evil, what is not evil, what is good, what is bad, all these things keep changing with time.

**Key Quote:** "By today's standards, Ramana is a very good man."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Ravana's abduction of Sita to illustrate how perceptions of good and evil change over time, contrasting the severe punishment Ravana faced in Vedic times with the relatively lenient punishments for similar crimes today.

If you look at Ravana in his time, he was considered an evil man because he abducted Sita against her will and he imprisoned her. And when Ramachandra came to claim her back, he refused to return her and fought a battle to death with him. By today's standards, if you see, Ravana just abducted her, that's all. He didn't do anything else. So by today's standards, Ravana is a very good man. He was very honorable. He kept telling Sita Devi, marry me. He did not violate her in any other way. But in his time, what he did was evil. To abduct a woman against her will, he had to give up his life. So, in Vedic times, even abduction of a woman was considered so evil that anybody who would do that could be sentenced to death. That was the culture at that time. Today, you know, it's not a major thing. Somebody, even if he forces himself upon a woman, even if he rapes her, maximum the court will give some few years of imprisonment. After that, he is free. And that imprisonment also will come after decades of trial. So many years of trial, then Sessions Court, then the High Court, then the Supreme Court. Practically, by that time, the man who committed the crime will already be on his death bed. What is the use of all this sentencing? So in today's world, the maximum punishment that a man can get for violating a woman's modesty is a few years of imprisonment. That's all. It's not considered all that evil. Whereas, Ravana, just for abducting Sita, he had to give up his life.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "What is good at one time becomes bad at another. What is bad at one time becomes good at another time."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to argue that the definition of evil changes with time, citing examples of intoxication and live-in relationships, and how societal views on these topics have shifted over the years.

He was punished by taking his life. So, according to Shastra, Atataina, seven kinds of aggressors are there. One of them is one who abducts another's wife. He is considered an Atatain, aggressor. And all such aggressors can be given the death penalty. So, evilness is... The definition of evilness keeps changing with time, according to society's perception of what is right, wrong, changing cultures, societal norms, etc. Similarly, if you look at intoxication. A hundred years back in India, if anybody intoxicated, the whole society would look at him with abhorrence. Oh, this man is a drunkard. But today, it is a prestige matter to drink. You go to any rich man's house, there will be one section, a bar with all kinds of alcoholic drinks. It is prestigious to have. If you go to a rich man's house and there is no bar, then it looks very bad. What is this man? He is not even having a bar in his house. You can imagine. Today, the perception has changed. People's values have changed. That is why in Chaitanya Charitamrita, Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami says, This is good, this is bad. What we think this is good and this is bad in the material world is all Manodharma. It is all our mental concoction. According to the circumstances, we say this is good, this is bad. Some years later, our perception changes, our value system changes, our culture changes. We will say no. What we considered bad earlier, is actually good. And what we considered good till now is bad. A hundred years back, in India, if you spoke of live-in relationships, very bad. Marriage, good. Today, if you speak of marriage, very bad. Live-in relationship, very good. Changes. People's perception, people's value system changes. What is good at one time becomes bad at another. What is bad at one time becomes good at another time. So, there is this.

**Key Quote:** "All this consideration in the material world, everything is born of ignorance."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the concepts of good and bad in the material world are mental concoctions born of ignorance, using the analogy of wet and dry stool to illustrate that both are ultimately undesirable.

This keeps on changing. So, you cannot say what is permanently good and what is permanently bad. This is all because of our mental concoction. Prabhupada gives an example, just like wet stool and dry stool. If we say this is wet stool, this is bad. This is dry stool. Dry stool is good. Does it have any meaning? Wet stool, dry stool, all bad only. Similarly, This is good, this is bad. All this consideration in the material world, everything is born of ignorance. Though this, we are, somebody is helping other people, somebody is doing good to others, somebody is doing charity. Oh, these are all good things. Somebody is stealing, somebody is harming others, somebody is cheating others, these are all bad things. All good, bad is good. All good, bad, everything is bad only in the material world. Everything is born of ignorance only. We have created our own mano dharmas, our own dharmas, our own duties and what is right and wrong in this material world out of our own mental concoctions arising out of our bodily concept of life which is a result of our ignorance. So, it is not a matter of only evil being born of ignorance. Even whatever we think good is also born out of ignorance.

**Verse References:** BG 18.66
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The only eternally good thing is surrendering unto Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes that only devotional service to Krishna is outside the realm of ignorance and that surrendering to Krishna is the only truly good thing, contrasting it with the ever-changing and ultimately ignorant notions of good and evil in the material world.

Only devotional service to Krishna is outside the purview of ignorance. Therefore, Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita, sarva dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. Give up all other types of concocted duties. Simply surrender unto me, Krishna says. This means surrendering to Krishna is the only really good thing, the only really thing which is arising out of enlightenment. That is why Krishna also tells in the Bhagavad Gita. What does Krishna say? Krishna says that bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan, meaning a person who is in knowledge, one who has cultivated spiritual knowledge for many many lifetimes. bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate vasudevaha sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah. If you are really not in ignorance, if you are really in jnana, knowledge, then you should be surrendering to Krishna saying that Krishna is everything. If I serve Krishna, then all other duties are fulfilled. If I don't surrender to Krishna, no matter whether I am evil or good in the eyes of the material people, it is all ignorance. Alright. So therefore, it's not a matter of evil being the highest degree of ignorance. The ignorance is our non-surrendering to Krishna. Non-submission to Krishna is ignorance. Rest, good, evil, bad, all these things, it's all changing from time to time. There is no set standard. There is no eternally good, eternally evil thing. The only eternally good thing is surrendering unto Krishna. That's all. Everything else is born of ignorance.

**Summary:** Chanting the holy name of Krishna is a merciful gift that cleanses the heart, leading to self-realization and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

Can I chant without mala and can I chant while walking with slippers? Krishna, sorry, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in his Sixth Ashtaka, he says, Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, O Krishna, you are very, very merciful. Why? Because you have given your holy name. And your holy name can be chanted by everyone in the material world today. And by chanting the holy name, we can develop love of Krishna. This is your great kripa. That when the holy name rises in our heart, what happens? The mirror of our mind gets cleansed. Our perception of the material world becomes clearer and clearer. We are able to see, I am not the body, I am a spirit soul. We are able to see that material sense creativity. We are able to see that material sense education has no value. We are able to perceive that going back to Godhead is the goal of life. So all these perceptions come about by the cleansing of the mirror of the mind. And because of this cleansing of the mind of the heart, what is it that we are achieving? Chetodarpana marjanam bhava maha dava agni nirvapanam. The intense forest fire of... Repeated material birth and death gets vanquished simply by chanting Krishna's holy name. Param vijayate sri krishna sankirtanam. So Krishna is very merciful. He has given his holy name simply by the process of chanting Hare Krishna. No big endeavor required. Simply we are to chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare, Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. Simply by doing this, the forest fire... Which is burning our heart of repeated birth and death within this material world will be vanquished and we will be able to see everything properly in full enlightenment with self-realization that I am not the body, I am spirit-soul.

So when we chant Krishna's holy name, that holy name of Krishna has as much power as if Krishna was personally standing there. This is an extremely wonderful thing. So you see the kripa of Krishna. This is the kripa of Krishna. This is the compassion of Krishna. That he has invested all his powers in his holy name. Simply by chanting Krishna's holy name, Krishna, along with all his Shakti's, potencies is present there. Nam Namakari Bahuda, Nija Sarva Shakti. Tatrarpita Niyamitah Smarane Nakalaha. Nakalaha Nanyamaha. There is no rule and regulation to be followed in chanting Krishna's holy name. Anywhere and everywhere, all the time, 24 bar 7. You can chant Krishna's holy name. And there is no consideration of place. Kala and time. No, it has to be chanted only during the three Sandhya. I cannot chant during evening. I should not chant during night time. No such restriction exists in chanting the holy name of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Although chanting Hare Krishna has no rule and regulation, what it means is, I have, there is no rule and regulation for chanting Hare Krishna, but if I want rapid progress in spiritual life by chanting Hare Krishna, I should chant a minimum fixed number of times every day without fail."
**Summary:** While there are no strict rules for chanting, a fixed number of rounds chanted daily is recommended for rapid spiritual progress.

So, to chant Krishna's holy name, to chant Hare Krishna, there are no hard and fast rules and regulations. You can wear your slipper and walk and chant Hare Krishna. You can remove your slipper and walk and chant Hare Krishna. You can wear your slipper and sit on a chair and chant Hare Krishna. You can remove your slipper and chant, sit and chant Hare Krishna. Whatever condition you want, you can sit, you can chant Hare Krishna. Whether you have a mala, you don't have a mala, you are walking, you are running, you are driving, you are swimming, you are bathing, you are eating, you are sleeping, whatever condition you want, you can sit, you can chant Hare Krishna. Whether you have a mala, you don't have a mala, you are walking, you are running, you are driving, you are swimming, you are bathing, you are eating, you are sleeping, whatever condition you want, you can sit, you can chant Hare Krishna. Whether you have a mala, you don't have a mala, you are walking, you are running, you are driving, you are swimming, you are bathing, you are eating, you are sleeping, whatever condition you are in, you can chant Hare Krishna. But the point is, this chanting of Hare Krishna has to be done according to a certain fixed number so that we can achieve quick results, rapid results in advancing in Krishna consciousness. Although chanting Hare Krishna has no rule and regulation, what it means is, I have, there is no rule and regulation for chanting Hare Krishna, but if I want rapid progress in spiritual life by chanting Hare Krishna, I should chant a minimum fixed number of times every day without fail.

**Key Quote:** "And Prabhupada said, the basic qualification, the basic number of rounds that we all have to chant is minimum 16 malas of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra every day."
**Summary:** Chanting a fixed number of rounds, specifically 16 malas, is like exercising to develop muscles, and using a mala helps keep track of the count to maintain the vow.

This is like how we exercise, suppose I want to develop my biceps, then I have to do certain exercises with dumbbells every day. I have to do it a fixed number of times every day, I have to count and do, one, two, three, four. When you go to the gym, you have seen, no, you have seen people, whatever they do, they will do according to one count and they will say, yesterday I did 30 times, now today I will do 35 times, I will do 40 times, they will count and do. So if we want rapid progress in spiritual life. And we want to take full advantage of the holy name of Krishna, then we have to chant a fixed number of times as a vow every day, minimum. And Prabhupada said, the basic qualification, the basic number of rounds that we all have to chant is minimum 16 malas of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra every day. Now, if you have to count every day that you are chanting 16 malas. 16 into 100. Each mala is 108 beads, 108 times you have to chant the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. And like that you have to do 16 times. That means 1728 times you have to chant the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra every day without fail. So to help you to keep count of how many times you are chanting, it is, the Acharyas have given us the process of chanting on the beads. So chanting on the beads is a process in our Sampradaya which is given by our Acharyas by which we can count, we can keep track of the number of times I am chanting every day so that we can maintain our vow or vrata and this will ensure that we get the richest benefit of chanting Hare Krishna. Otherwise there is no rule and regulation which needs to be followed in chanting the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the four bona fide Vaishnava Sampradayas according to the Padma Purana: Sri Sampradaya, Madhva Sampradaya (Brahma Sampradaya), Kumara Sampradaya, and Rudra Sampradaya.

According to the Padma Purana, there are four Sampradayas which are actually bona fide, referring to the four systems of philosophy: Dvaita, Vishishtha Advaita, Dvaita Advaita, and Suddha Advaita. So these four systems of philosophy are propounded by four Vaishnava Acharyas. These are the Sri Sampradaya, the Madhva Sampradaya, which is the Brahma Sampradaya, then there is the Kumara Sampradaya, and there is the Rudra Sampradaya. Vishnu Swami is the main Acharya for the Rudra Sampradaya.

**Key Quote:** "These are the four systems of philosophy which are declined to be bona fide in the Puranas."
**Summary:** The speaker identifies the Acharyas associated with each Sampradaya and contrasts them with Shankaracharya's Mayavada philosophy, which is not considered bona fide.

For the Kumara Sampradaya, it is Vishnu Swami, and for Sri Sampradaya, it is Ramanuja Acharya, and for Brahma Sampradaya, it is Madhva Acharya. These are the four systems of philosophy which are declined to be bona fide in the Puranas. The fifth Sampradaya, which is founded by Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya, is called Mayavada, and it is not recognized as a bona fide philosophy in the Indian system. So all these four systems of philosophy—Dvaita, Vishishta Dvaita, Shuddha Dvaita, Dvaita Dvaita—these four systems of philosophy come in the Sri Sampradaya, Kumara Sampradaya, Rudra Sampradaya, and Brahma Sampradaya.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "These four systems of philosophy, all of them are Vaishnava philosophy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the four Vaishnava Sampradayas share the common goal of achieving liberation and going to Vaikuntha, maintaining individuality as servants of the Lord, contrasting this with Adi Shankara's Kevala Dvaita, which aims at merging into impersonal Brahman.

They all accept Vishnu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all of them say that when we achieve liberation, or moksha, or mukti, we go to the spiritual world, Vaikuntha, where we will continue our individuality as an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Now, in terms of certain finer details of the philosophy, there may be some differences between these four systems, but ultimately, all of these four are aiming towards the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas Adi Shankara's philosophy of Kevala Dvaita is aiming at merging into Brahman.

**Key Quote:** "There is no individual existence."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Vaishnava understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth as a person (Paramatma) and the individual soul (Atma) as a fragmental portion, contrasting this with the Mayavada concept of impersonal Brahman.

There is no individual existence. The Supreme Absolute Truth is some impersonal Nirakar Brahman, whereas all the other four Vaishnava systems of philosophy, they declare that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person. It's not just some impersonal Brahman, and we are Atma. We can never become equal to Paramatma. We will always remain Paramatma as a fragmental portion of that Supreme Absolute Truth, and we will always remain as a small Jeeva, a small Atma, whereas Vishnu or Narayana, He is the Paramatma. He is the Supreme Personality. So this is the fundamental difference between the Mayavada philosophy and the combined all the four Vaishnava philosophies.

**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges minor differences within the four Vaishnava philosophies, highlighting that all accept Narayana as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, except for the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy, which considers Krishna as supreme.

Now, within the four Vaishnava philosophies, there are finer differences, very minor, they are not major, but all of them accept Narayana as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy, which is Achintya Veda Veda Tattva, which is a sub-sect of the Madhva philosophy, of the Brahma Sampradaya, we accept Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All the other four, it is Narayana. So, Krishna being the Avatari, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, on the basis of scriptural evidence, is accepted only in the Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya. All four are Vaishnava Sampradayas, but amongst the Vaishnava Sampradayas also, there are some differences.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the Gaudiya Vaishnava perspective that Krishna is not an incarnation but the source of all incarnations, citing Krishna's declaration in the Bhagavad Gita that He is the source of everything.

According to the other Vaishnava Sampradayas, Krishna is supposed to be an Avatara, incarnation. But in the Madhva Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya, we understand Krishna is not an incarnation, because there are references. Krishna himself tells, declares in the Bhagavad Gita, am sarvasya prabhavo mattaha sarvam pravartate. Krishna says that He is the source of everything else. Sarvam pravartate, everything is emanating from Krishna. Everything means everything, including Narayana and Vishnu.

**Key Quote:** "there is nothing above me, Krishna says."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to establish Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, citing verses from the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam that support the idea that Krishna is the source of all incarnations (Avatari).

Krishna declares openly, there is nothing above me, Krishna says. So when Krishna is saying, nothing is above Him, that means even Narayana is not above Him. Not only that, in the Bhagavatam, Bhagavatam lists 22 incarnations. Bhagavatam lists all the Purusha Avataras also. Vishnu's incarnation, three forms of Vishnu are incarnations: Karanodaka Sai Vishnu, and then Garbhodaka Sai Vishnu, Sri Rodaka Sai Vishnu, apart from that, all the other incarnations, Lord Ramachandra, Narsimha, Vamana, Kurma, Meena, all of them are listed. At the end of listing all of them, the Bhagavatam says, eteya chamsa kalahapamsa krishnastu bhagavan svayam. That all these lists of incarnations are expansions, or expansions of the expansions of Krishna, but Krishna himself is not an incarnation. He is not an avatara, He is an avatari. He is the source of all incarnations. He is the fountainhead of all incarnations. So you see, the Bhagavatam also very clearly establishes that.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But ultimately, the four Vaishnava systems all accept that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, Paramatma, Narayana or Krishna"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the common ground among the four Vaishnava systems: the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, and the goal is to reach Vaikuntha and serve Narayana or Krishna, emphasizing that following a bona fide parampara in any of these four Sampradayas leads to this goal, unlike the Shankaracharya system.

And so, there are many other verses also in the Bhagavatam. So, like this, there may be some finer differences of opinion in the philosophies of the four systems, but ultimately, the four Vaishnava systems all accept that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, Paramatma, Narayana or Krishna, in Vaikuntha, Goloka, Vrindavan, and the goal of the human form of life is to go to the spiritual world, Vaikuntha, and remain as a person, as a personal servant to Narayana or Krishna. So, this everybody answers. That's the fundamental common ground, but in the finer details, there may be some differences, okay? So, all the four Vaishnava Sampradayas, anybody who follows the bona fide parampara in any one of these four Sampradayas—Brahma Sampradaya, Shri Sampradaya, Kumara Sampradaya, Rudra Sampradaya—they will all go to Vaikuntha or to Krishna. So, this is possible in one of these four Sampradayas, but not in the Shankaracharya system of his parampara. Alright? Thank you very much.

Krishna wanted to teach the living entities by his personal example. Just like when we go to school, the teacher will take a chalk and write on the board, write A like this, B like this, C like this. So the teacher knows much more than A, B, C, D, but she takes the role of somebody who is learning how to write alphabets, so that the children can learn how to write A, B, C, D.

So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, although by his personal behavior and example, he set the example of how a devotee should execute his devotion service to Krishna. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu himself did not write much literature, philosophy. He left it to his disciples, the Shad Goswamis, especially Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami. They wrote extensively about the philosophy of Bhakti Yoga. But Chaitanya Mahaprabhu himself, if you see, he left behind only the Six Ashtaka, eight verses which he composed himself.

If I have to wipe the floor of the temple hall, I have to sweep the temple hall, I have to render some practical devotional service like this, I will develop a taste for it. It will become greatly pleasurable for me. Nobody has to tell me as a rule, you have to follow the four regulated principles, you have to fast on ekadashi, you have to fast on janmashtami. You will be waiting for that opportunity. So, you have to come to that point of taste. And when further you develop that taste, then slowly it will transform into bhava bhakti.

**Key Quote:** "So, if God is all merciful, why doesn't he protect his devotees all the time?"
**Summary:** The lecture begins by posing the question of why Krishna allows suffering, especially among devotees, despite being merciful.

This question is, why does Krishna allow us to suffer if he is always merciful? Good question. If God is all merciful, if he is all kind, why does he allow living entities to suffer in the material world? Why do we see suffering in the material world? Like we also hear, there was a pilgrimage. Some people were going in a bus to Kedarnath. Suddenly the bus fell down, had an accident and all the people died. Or there was some flood and the people who were on pilgrimage, they got killed. Or somebody was going for Navaratri and they were going on a pilgrimage somewhere and they met with an accident and they died. So, why do the devotees of God, they are religious people, they are pious people, why is God not protecting them? Such people, the religious people also suffer. They also have to undergo disease. They also have to undergo so many other distresses. They have to become old. They also have to die. So, if God is all merciful, why doesn't he protect his devotees all the time? So, the point is, Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, my devotee will never be vanquished. So, if you see in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, so many big, big generals were there. Personalities like Bhishma, Karna, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, all big, big generals, Duryodhana himself, they were all powerful fighters, warriors. Arjuna was no match for all of them. But still, at the end of the day, he was a great warrior. At the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, who survived? Pandavas survived. Entire Kaurava army was wiped out. Why? Because Krishna was protecting Arjuna. So, Krishna protects Arjuna. Why not all of us? Right? Then why do people who are going on a pilgrimage, they are going to Kedarnath, Badrinath, why are they getting killed? Why are they suffering? If you see, all the people who are going on pilgrimages, they will all have some prayer. Some problem is there. Some financial problem. Health problem is there. Health problem is there. Relational problem is there. They are going, they undertake these severe austerities. Why? Because they want their problem to be solved. And these people, they are going to God, praying to him for solving their problem. And instead, what happens? They get killed. What is this? God is not merciful.

### surrender, divine protection, faith

**Key Quote:** "To the extent we surrender unto Krishna, to that extent, Krishna will protect us."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's protection is proportional to one's surrender and faith, using Arjuna's unwavering conviction as an example.

So, the point we have to understand is, when Krishna says, Krishna says, My devotee will never be vanquished. There are two aspects to this statement from Krishna. There is another statement of Krishna also in the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna says, To the extent we surrender unto Krishna, to that extent, Krishna will protect us. So, if we are partially surrendered to Krishna, something I am keeping for myself and something for Krishna also, then Krishna's protection also will be to that extent. If my faith in Krishna is not protected, then Krishna's protection also will be to that extent. If my faith in Krishna is not protected, then Krishna's protection also will be to that extent. Krishna will protect me. How much do we have faith in that understanding, in that conviction? Arjuna was fully convinced, Krishna is my sole protector. How do we know Arjuna was fully convinced of this? When Duryodhana and Arjuna went to Krishna seeking help for the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna, what did Krishna tell Arjuna? Krishna told Arjuna and Duryodhana, Krishna told Arjuna and Duryodhana, I will divide myself: one side my entire yadava army with all their modern weaponry, all their general soldiers, chariots, elephants, all of that, all the action; on the other hand, myself. I will not lift any weapon. I, all alone, unarmed, will be there on the other side. You choose which one you want. Without batting an eyelid, Arjuna said, I want you. Arjuna said, I want you. So Duryodhana was very happy. He said, ah, Arjuna is such a fool. He is taking Krishna. Okay, if Krishna and said I will fight for you, then okay, you can think because Krishna is powerful warrior. But Krishna said I will not lift any weapon, so what is the use of taking him? So I got all the army, he said, and he walked out. So when Duryodhana walked out, Krishna asked Arjuna, Arjuna, what with what intelligence, what happened to your intelligence? Why did you choose me? I said I will not fight, I will not lift a weapon, then why did you choose me? So Arjuna said, my dear Krishna, you are all alone, no need of any army soldier. One thing is required, you alone are capable of leading this battle. I know if you stand on one side, no army in the world can defeat you. Although you may be unarmed, but still at the same time, by your grace and your devotee, you will ensure that I will also be victorious. I also know that. But at the same time, I want that the credit for the victory in this battle should go to you. People should say because Krishna was there on the side of the Pandavas, the Pandavas won. So therefore I chose you. See Arjuna's conviction, even before the battle began, he knew that he was going to win because Krishna is there on his side.

### divine protection, material limitations, Prahlad Maharaj

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Prahlad Maharaj was fully convinced Krishna is my sole protector."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Prahlad Maharaj's unwavering faith and the story of John F. Kennedy's inability to save his child to illustrate that material means are insufficient without Krishna's sanction.

So do we have that kind of conviction that hundred percent Krishna will protect me? If we have that kind of conviction, then Krishna will protect us from every danger. We look at Prahlad Maharaj. Prahlad Maharaj was fully convinced Krishna is my sole protector. In fact, the... Prahlad Maharaj has committed to Narsimha Dev, what did he say? He said, so he said, Prahlad Maharaj said, my dear Supreme Lord Narsimha, people think that if a child has got good parents, then the child has love and then man should... the right way of thinking more clearly is he had the ability of only... how many years have you been? But you could not see him. He could have not seen him. Then you can still see him, but that's why Brahmade fall thirty years of honey hidden in my eye to this sight. He to the south rationalisation of knowledge. Happy old baby man who not only might be shamed, but would say he is out... by his customs has got good parents, then the child will be well protected. But actually even the richest per... richest and most powerful parents, sometimes their children died. For example, John F Kennedy, he was the president of the United States of America, richest country, the president of the United States, most powerful man, and his wife became pregnant. And when his wife became pregnant, from the United States government, one of the topmost doctor in the country was enlisted and told that you have no other work, 24 hours here to be with John F Kennedy's wife until the child is born, here to ensure that no problem happens. So the best medical care, the best medical science, technology, money, no dirt, entire government is behind him, what more do you need? And when the child was born, it was a good thing for the child, diagnosed with a very rare physical condition. So immediately that doctor, because he was a top expert, he called other experts, they got all the most modern equipments, they put that baby into into that intensive care. After a few days, the baby died. So John F Kennedy, he did everything in his power, most powerful man, wealthiest man, why there cannot be anyone better than him in this world at that point of time? There was nobody more powerful than him, there is nobody wealthier than him, there is nobody else who had access to all the best medical science and technology, but still he could not save his child. Balasya Neha Saranam Pitarao Narsimha, just parents alone are not the cause of the protection of the children. Nartasya Chagadam, it is not that medicine alone is the cause of curing a disease.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Behind all this, unless Krishna sanctions, the parents' protection for the child will not work."
**Summary:** The speaker provides further analogies of a CEO unable to save his father despite the best medicine and the Titanic's sinking to emphasize that Krishna's sanction is ultimately necessary for protection and success.

Nartasya Chagadam, it is not that medicine alone is the cause of curing a disease. Nartasya Chagadam, it is not that medicine alone is the cause of curing a disease. I remember there was one acquaintance of mine, he was a CEO of some animation company and this was in Bangalore and what happened, he was probably 45, 50 years old and his father fell sick and he was admitted to a hospital, Malia hospital was a, you know, most advanced the hospital in Bangalore at that time. This chance speaking must be about 20-25 years back. So he write all that school w.d Kre? from Bhawana Japtanabhos科 volumes to the pages and not from your ownkie .sq. class. So Bangalore, Malia hospital was the most advanced multi-speciality hospital in Bangalore at that time. So he took his father and admitted him there and the doctors told, this condition that your father has got, if he has to survive, we have to import one medicine and every day we have to give him that injection. It will cost some, I don't remember the figure, it was some like one lakh, two lakh rupees per injection per day. So that man said, no problem, all my wealth is meant for my father, if I am not able to save my father with this money, what is the use of this money? And he was quite well off, so he could afford it, he said, go ahead, no problem. So they immediately imported the medicine and every day they started giving that injection. By the third day, the father passed away. So best medicine, no constraint of money, still the person could not be saved. Best doctors, best hospital, best medicine, imported medicine, what more can you ask for? So narthasya chagadam, for a artha, for a person who is diseased, medicine alone is not the cure. Medicine may be one of the factors, but it alone is not the factor to cure a diseased person. Udanvato majjato nauhu, Udanvati, in the ocean, majjato, somebody is drowning. Ashyam. A ship alone is not the cause of his getting saved. A ship can also become a cause of his drowning in the ocean. Titanic, they said, unsinkable ship, on its maiden voyage, it sank and more than thousand people died. Udanvato majjato nauhu, for a person who is drowning in the ocean, a boat or a ship alone is not the cause of his saving. Even the boat can capsize. Even the ship can capsize and the person will be finished. So behind all this, unless Krishna sanctions, the parents' protection for the child will not work. The medicine will not cure the disease. The boat will not be able to save the drowning man. This is the reality. So Prahlad Maharaj was fully convinced that without, ultimately without Krishna's sanction, none of these things, none of the protective measures in the material world will work.

### surrender, devotion, divine protection
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/xC0omTIbn4Q?t=704
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "To the extent we are surrendered to Krishna, to that extent Krishna will protect."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts Prahlad Maharaj drinking poison unharmed due to his complete surrender and devotion, emphasizing that Krishna responds to devotion and surrender, like a father favoring an obedient child.

And if Krishna protects, then no material, uh, challenge or material problem can affect you. Prahlad Maharaj was fully convinced of this. So therefore, when his father, He told Prahlad Maharaj's mother that I've tried killing Prahlad in many ways. I tried putting him into a poison, into a pit full of poisonous snakes. I tried dipping him into a pot of boiling oil. I tried throwing him from the top of a cliff. I tried getting elephants to trample him to death. Nothing is working. So I've decided we have to give him poison. And he took a glass of poison and gave it to his wife and told, feed this to your son. So the mother started crying, how will I feed poison to my son? And Prahlad Maharaj saw his mother crying and he said, why are you crying? He said, what to do my son, your father has said, I have to feed you poison. And then Prahlad Maharaj said, okay, no problem, mother, you give me the poison. Because if you don't give me that poison, my father is such a cruel and evil man. He will make you drink that poison. So give it to me. No problem. I'll drink it. So Prahlad Maharaj confidently took that poison and he said, if Krishna wants, he will protect me. And if Krishna doesn't want, I will die. So he drank that poison. What happened? Nothing happened. Why? Because Prahlad Maharaj was firmly convinced Krishna is the sole protector. So therefore the poison, the elephants, the venomous snakes, nothing could kill him. Nothing could hurt him. So you see to the extent we are surrendered to Krishna, to that extent Krishna will protect. Krishna is not our order carrier. He is not our doorkeeper. He is not our security guard, bodyguard. That is why he is our protector. He is our protector. He is our protector. But I am a devotee, you have to protect me. No. So Krishna goes by devotion and surrender. How much we are devotional to Krishna, surrender to Krishna, how much we have confidence in Krishna, to that extent Krishna will protect us. So this is not unnatural because we have to understand that if there is a person in this material world and he has a son or a daughter who is very obedient and devoted to the father, and there is another child who is rebellious, always not listening to the father and always working contradictorily to the father's instructions, now if there is a situation where the father has to save one of the child, one of the children, whom will he choose? Naturally first he will try to save the child who is obedient, no? Natural. Similarly Krishna also. He will first protect. He will first protect. He will give his full protection to one who is fully surrendered to him.

### eternal soul, liberation, Krishna's mercy

**Verse References:** BG 8.16
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Ultimately Krishna's protection is for the soul, not for the body."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that while devotees still face physical challenges, Krishna's ultimate protection is the liberation of the soul from repeated birth and death, offering a return to Godhead.

This is one thing. Another thing we have to understand is no matter even if we become a pure devotee, fully surrendered to Krishna, still one day or the other we have to die. Still old age will come, still disease will come because this is the material body. Material body will become diseased, it will become old, it will become destroyed at one point of time. But we, spirit soul, are eternal. We are eternal. We are not going to get destroyed. Body may get destroyed, but we will not get destroyed. Avinashituti tadviddhi, yena sarvam etan tatam. This body is pervaded by the soul. It's pervaded by our consciousness. So even though the body may get destroyed, we will not get destroyed. So ultimately Krishna's protection is for the soul, not for the body. For the body also, Krishna will give protection if it is essential. Like Krishna protected Arjuna and Prahlad Mahabharata. Like Krishna protected Arjuna and Prahlad Mahabharata. But then Over and above that is Krishna's protection from repeated birth and death within the material world. Once a devotee dies, Krishna will take the devotee back to godhood, where there is no more birth and death. Yad gatvana nim ratan te taddioSo Krishna said Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, if you become a pure devotee, Krishna says I will take you to my abode the spiritual world where you don't old, there is no disease there, there is no financial problem, there is no, there is no problem at all that you will have to face. You have only to simply sing and dance and enjoy in total bliss there. So Krishna is ready to take us there. So that is the real protection of Krishna ultimately. So externally, it might seem that even a devotee is becoming old, devotees become diseased, even he is dying. But then what happens after that death? The devotee goes back to Godhead. Non-devotee what happens? He is again put into another body, again he has to undergo the cycle of repeated birth, death, disease, old age. Repeatedly he has to undergo. So Krishna's, ultimately Krishna's protection isn't taking us back to Godhead. So Krishna is all merciful. He gives his protection to his devotees. Now the question is, if Krishna is all merciful, why is he protecting only his devotees? Why

### impartiality, free will, Krishna's efforts to reclaim souls

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Krishna says, I am equal to everyone. I am impartial."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the apparent contradiction of Krishna being impartial yet favoring devotees, explaining that Krishna's impartiality lies in granting free will while constantly striving to bring souls back to Him through scriptures, devotees, and incarnations.

is he partial? But Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, nadeśvostin apriyaḥ samoham sarva-bhūteśv. Krishna says, I am equal to everyone. I am impartial. But at the same time, Krishna is giving special protection to his devotees. How do we understand this? So to understand this is very simple. Krishna is very merciful. We have rebelled against Krishna from the spiritual world and come to the material world. Krishna could have abandoned us, get lost. I am not bothered about it. I am not bothered about it. I am not bothered about it. I am not bothered about it. I am not bothered about you, Krishna could have abandoned us. No. But Krishna did not abandon we have forgotten Krishna. We have rejected Krishna and Come here, but Krishna no, he has rejected me. but Krishan no. He has rejected me. He has forgotten me, but no, he's my Amchā. He's my child. I cannot forget him. So what Krishna does Krishna sends his pure devotees, āchāryas do the material world. Personalities like Ramana Jāchārya, Madhvāchārya, Selep Praupadhi himself. All these personalities come from the spiritual world, his teachings when he moved them from his... He moved them from his spiritual world. And then Krishan Dash engineering by these spiritual the spiritual world. Krishna has sent them here to tell us about Krishna and take us back to Godhead. As if that is not enough, Krishna gives the Vedic scriptures. He gives the Upanishads, the Vedanta Sutras, where he talks that you are not the body, you are spirit soul, your destination is, your eternal about is the spiritual world, come back there. So Krishna gives the Vedic scriptures for this. And even after that Krishna is not satisfied Krishna incarnates in many many different ages. He incarnates as Ramachandra, he incarnates as Narasimha, he incarnates as Vamana. In every incarnation what is he doing? He is telling forget this material world and come back to the spiritual world. So Krishna gives the Vedic scriptures, Krishna sends his pure devotees as Acharyas, Krishna incarnates. Even after doing all this Krishna is not satisfied. Krishna personally comes himself. And he incarnates. He demonstrates what are all the activities he does in the spiritual world. How he plays with Yesodamayi, Nandamaharaj, with the cows, with the Gopas, with the Gopis. Why Krishna does, has to do all these things in the material world? These are all his activities in the spiritual world. Why is he doing that in the material world? Because he wants us to see. See this is how the spiritual world is. You all can come back with me to the spiritual world and you can also enjoy with me like this. So Krishna comes personally. And how do we understand, so Krishna's impartiality is in allowing us freedom to surrender unto him or not surrender unto him. Krishna spoke the Bhagavad Gita and then Krishna told Arjuna yathaye chasi tathakuru. Oh Arjuna, I have told you whatever I have told you to do, whatever I have to tell I have told you, now you decide what you want to do. You want to surrender unto me, become my devotee and serve me or you don't want to surrender. I'm not going to surrender to my instructions. And if you decide to surrender unto me, Then I'm there for you. I will be protecting you and I will take you back to God. So even if one is an atheist, even if one is a non believer, if he surrenders to Krishna,

### surrender, divine promise, law of karma

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Any living entity comes to me and surrenders unto me saying, Tavasmi, O Ramachandra, I am yours. Please accept me. Abhayam Sarvada Dasyami. I will eternally protect him."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Vibhishana surrendering to Ramachandra to illustrate Krishna's promise to protect anyone who surrenders, regardless of their past, while those who don't surrender are governed by the law of karma.

Krishna will forget everything else and take him back to God. In fact, in the Ramayana, in the when Lord Ramachandra had taken the Vanara army. Ramachandra took the Lord Ramachandra and even as... Lord Ramachandra had taken the Lord Ramachandra. So even then he was in that state. He is leaving army to Lanka and they were making plans to attack Lanka to free Sita from the clutches of Ramana. What happened? Vibhishana came there. Vibhishana rejected his brother Ramana and he came to Ramachandra wanting to, because Vibhishana was also a devotee of Ramachandra so he wanted to join the army of Lord Ramachandra. He wanted to serve Lord Ramachandra. So when Vibhishana came, Ramachandra called all the Vanaras, Sugriva, Hanuman, all these people, Jambavan and he asked them, what should we do? He has come here. He has said he wants to surrender unto me and he wants to take my shelter and he wants to be with us. So Sugriva and others said, Ramachandra, we have to be very careful. Although he has come saying that he is wanting to surrender to you, but he is after all from an Asura, he is born in an Asura Kula. He is a brother of Ramana. And these Asuras cannot be trusted. Who knows he may have come here to spy upon us and then relay all that information to Ramana to defeat us. So we think you should not entertain him. So then Lord Ramachandra responded. Lord Ramachandra said, any person, any living entity who comes to me and surrenders to me. Even if I surrender to you, I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. I will not be able to take your shelter. Any living entity comes to me and surrenders unto me saying, Tavasmi, O Ramachandra, I am yours. Please accept me. Abhayam Sarvada Dasyami. I will eternally protect him. Why Vibhishana? If Ravana comes here and surrenders to me and says that Ramachandra, I am surrendering unto you, I will protect him also. This was Lord Ramachandra's statement. So you see, Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so impartial. We may be atheistic, we may be inimical to Krishna, but the moment we surrender to Krishna and say, Krishna, I am yours, finished. Krishna will take full responsibility and full charge of him. And Krishna will take him back to Godhead. So this is the impartiality of Krishna. Krishna has given the knowledge, instructions in the Bhagavad Gita, but anybody who picks it up and surrenders to Krishna, Krishna will immediately take charge of him. So this is the mercy of Krishna. Therefore Krishna is all merciful. Krishna has given us free will and allowed us. You don't want to surrender unto me? No problem. Then the law of karma will act according to the activities if you do. If you do pious activities, you will get enjoyment. If you do sinful activities, you will have to suffer. This is the law of karma in essence, in a very simplistic way. This is the law of karma in essence, in a very simplistic way.

**Key Quote:** "The moment we fully surrender to Krishna, no matter how much sinful activities we have accumulated in our past lives, Krishna says, all of that finished."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that suffering arises from the law of karma for those not fully surrendered, but complete surrender to Krishna nullifies past sins and guarantees protection and liberation, emphasizing Krishna's mercy and impartiality.

So Krishna has said, either you don't surrender to me, then you are governed by the law of karma. So according to the law of karma, if you have done some impious activity, some sinful activity in the past life, you will suffer. Krishna says, I will not interfere. So therefore there is suffering in the material world. Somebody may have partially surrendered to Krishna. He may be a devotee of Krishna, but still he has done some sinful activity. He may be a devotee of Krishna, but still he has done some sinful activity. That means he has not fully surrendered to Krishna. So he has done sinful activity, he has to suffer for that. Loss of this one material nature cannot be... Nobody can violate the laws of karma, the laws of material nature. But if he fully surrendered to Krishna, eshāntu antagatam pāpam janānām puṇya-karmanām te dvandva-moha-nirmukta bhajante mām dhratavratā bhajante mām Those who render devotional service to Krishna, antagatam pāpam, giving up all sinful activities, no more sinful activity, and always engaged in pious activity and rendering only devotional service to Krishna, such people, Krishna will protect from all miseries and Krishna will take back to God. But if we engage in sinful activity, that means we are not fully surrendered to Krishna, then Krishna's protection is also limited. He will allow the law of karma to act. And if I have done a sinful activity, I have to suffer, I have to suffer. Krishna will not interfere. But the moment we surrender unto Krishna, what happens? sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ rajaḥ āṁ tvām sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣiṣyām The moment we fully surrender to Krishna, no matter how much sinful activities we have accumulated in our past lives, Krishna says, all of that finished. I will remove everything. I will burn off everything. This is the mercy of Krishna. This is the impartiality of Krishna. You understand? So, just because somebody is suffering, we cannot say that God is not merciful. God is very merciful. He is allowing us to walk on the path which we want. Either surrender to Him or not surrender unto Him.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna describes kama or lust as nitya vairinaha. It is an eternal existence. It is the eternal enemy of a transcendentalist, of a person who wants to practice spiritual life."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the question of why lust persists even after spiritual progress, explaining that Krishna describes lust (kama) as an eternal enemy to spiritual practitioners.

Now this question, I have understood the teaching and importance of Krishna Consciousness so that I was able to overcome many of my attachments voluntarily. But lust is not like that. Why am I still finding taste in that, in lust? So Krishna tells about lust, that kama or lust is very deep rooted, kama yesha krodha yesha, rajo guna samudbha vaha. So kama, Krishna describes kama or lust as nitya vairinaha. It is an eternal existence. It is the eternal enemy of a transcendentalist, of a person who wants to practice spiritual life.

**Key Quote:** "As long as we do not give up the mode of passion, as long as we do not situate ourselves in sattoguna, the mode of goodness, what will happen, we will not be able to become free from the influence of lust and anger."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the interconnectedness of lust, anger, greed, illusion, envy, and madness, explaining that they arise from the mode of passion (rajoguna) and can only be overcome by cultivating the mode of goodness (sattoguna).

So this lust and anger, kama and krodha, we have to understand that these six things, kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha, matsarya, lust, anger, greed, illusion and then kama, krodha, lobha, mada, madness. Matsarya, envy, these six things always go hand in hand. They are like six brothers. If one is there, all the other five will also be there. So they may not manifest, all of the six may not manifest at the same time. But if one of them is present, that means the other five brothers are also residing within our heart. So Krishna says that these kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha, matsarya, these six enemies arise out of our contact with rajoguna, the mode of passion. As long as we do not give up the mode of passion, as long as we do not situate ourselves in sattoguna, the mode of goodness, what will happen, we will not be able to become free from the influence of lust and anger.

**Key Quote:** "If I pursue material knowledge, I want to do engineering, I want to do medical... All that material education we acquire in the schools and colleges are actually increasing the rajoguna component of rajoguna in our life."
**Summary:** The speaker asserts that freedom from lust requires ceasing association with the mode of passion, which is prominent in the material world and increased by the pursuit of material knowledge.

So if we really want to become free from lust. We have to stop associating with the mode of passion, rajoguna. The mode of passion, the mode of rajoguna is most prominent within this material world. It is prominent in people's desire to enjoy, to become happy. It manifests in different forms. Economic prosperity, peace. Everybody, all of us should live in harmony. Everybody should cooperate. Morality. We should help others. We should have that nationalistic spirit. We should, you know, strive for the country. All these are different forms of manifestation of rajoguna, the mode of passion. The progress. Rajoguna. Progress or the pursuit of material knowledge is also a product of the mode of passion. If I pursue material knowledge, I want to do engineering, I want to do medical, this one, I want to become a doctor, want to become a lawyer. We have different kinds of aspirations in this material world. And so that's how we go to college, we go to school. All that material education we acquire in the schools and colleges are actually increasing the rajoguna component in our life. They are increasing the mode of passion. Then how can you become free from lust?

**Key Quote:** "Pursuit of material education in schools and colleges, as well as what we learn from the society around us, both of them are actually teaching us to increase the amount of Rajoguna in our lives. Then how can you become free from this one, lust?"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that both formal material education and the knowledge acquired from society contribute to increasing the mode of passion, thus intensifying lust.

Not possible. See, when we are born as children, there is no force of lust in our heart. As we grow, slowly, gradually, we get more and more educated in material life. We acquire more and more material education. May not. Even if it is not for us. Maybe it is not formal education. I may be an illiterate. I may not have gone to school or college. But still I learn from people around me. I learn from material world, oh this is what I should aspire for. I should aspire to earn money. I should aspire to have a good house. I should have a good girlfriend or a good boyfriend. I should have children. I should have a family. I have a country. I should be proud of my country. All these things we pick up and learn. These are also knowledge that we acquire from around the material world around us. So, pursuit of material education in schools and colleges, as well as what we learn from the society around us, both of them are actually teaching us to increase the amount of Rajoguna in our lives. Then how can you become free from this one, lust? That is why you will see. As we grow older. And as we acquire more and more knowledge about the world around us, what happens? Lust also increases.

**Key Quote:** "In the Vedic times, the emphasis was not on material education. The emphasis was on spiritual education... so when that spiritual knowledge was most prominent in people's lives the influence of lust was also less"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts modern society's material advancement with the Vedic emphasis on spiritual education, arguing that the former leads to increased lust while the latter fostered restraint.

You see, India 50 years ago was not very materially advanced, economically not very advanced, technologically knowledge wise also not very advanced. So you look at India 50 years back, the level, the amount of lust in people's heart was not so high. People were far more restrained. But today, you look at the people, they become like animals. Men cannot control themselves. They will go and molest women, rape women, forget about women, even children are not spared. You look at movies, you look at novels, you look at television, serials, everywhere you see, that display of lust is going on increasing. As we are materially advancing, as we are improving in our knowledge acquisition systems and material knowledge, simultaneously the influence of lust is also increasing in the society. In the Vedic times, the emphasis was not on material education. The emphasis was on spiritual education. From the age of five years, till 25 years. Every person had to respond. It was a beautiful world. go and live in the gurukula where he will be taught you are not the body your spirit soul the goal of life is to go back to godhead along with that also material education would also be given whatever is needed for that person to execute his livelihood that much knowledge would be given not that everybody has to learn everything no if you are a kshatriya you learn administrative knowledge if you are a vaisya learn how to do business if you are a brahmana you learn only spiritual knowledge that used to be the system you have limited material knowledge but primarily in those 20 years you live in the gurus ashram what happens you learn about spiritual knowledge so when that spiritual knowledge was most prominent in people's lives the influence of lust was also less

**Summary:** The speaker argues that despite perceived advancements in civility and equality, material progress correlates with a decline in control over lust and an increase in its manifestation.

now when people are materially advancing we are supposed to be a civilized society our understanding of how civility comes about women have to be given equal rights in society we should not discriminate on the basis of caste creed color religion race nationality etc all these concepts we feel we have understood these things better we are more advanced but simultaneously what is happening girl children are giving birth to babies in nine standard 10 standard in the toilets of the schools this is what is becoming common nowadays yes or no this is the reality the president of france says that in schools we should distribute contraceptives freely to the students why because if you don't do that they are anyway engaging in sex and we are having to face teen pregnancies so this is a problem in the west also not only in india india is coming today west has been grappling with this problem since ages so you see the more materially advanced you are the lesser the control on lust the greater the display of lust so if we associate with the mode of passion the greater the display of lust so if we associate with the mode of passion

**Key Quote:** "If you want to become free from lust you have to increase the component of and if you have to increase whatever is aspired for in the modern day society you have to give up...In Kali Yuga, the method is to directly associate with Krishna himself."
**Summary:** The speaker states that overcoming lust requires increasing sattva guna, which in Kali Yuga is best achieved by directly associating with Krishna through devotional practices.

lust will increase if you want to become free from lust you have to increase the component of and if you have to increase whatever is aspired for in the modern day society you have to give up that's the reality so as long as you live in that material life and you go on you know associating with people even if you associate with people who have this kind of aspirations To earn money, to have a good material life, to be peaceful, comfortable, to have a status and prestige in society, to have a good partner in life. Anybody who has desires like this, you associate with them, the influence of Rajoguna will contaminate you and your heart will be conquered by lust. So if you want to become free from lust, only way is that you have to give up your association with Rajoguna and you have to associate with Sattva Guna. And in Kali Yuga, Sattva Guna is very rarely obtained. So in Kali Yuga, the method is to directly associate with Krishna himself. Because Krishna is Pavitram Paramam Bhavan, Krishna is the purest personality. So if we associate with Krishna, we are associating with Vishuddha Sattva, not even Sattva Guna. And if we associate with Krishna by chanting Krishna's holy name, by following the regulative principles, by getting up early in the morning and chanting during Brahmamurtha, by rendering practical devotional service for the spiritual master's mission, by all these things what happens? We increase the quantity of Vishuddha Sattva, our contact with Vishuddha Sattva we establish. Okay? And by that what happens? The influence of Rajoguna will come down.

So therefore, unless we increase the component of Bhakti in our life, unless we ensure that we remain connected with Krishna... we cannot help but be conquered by the forces of lust and anger."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the difficulty of conquering lust, even for great sages, and stresses the need for constant connection with Krishna through bhakti to avoid being overcome by lust and anger, using the story of Vishwamitra Muni as an example.

So conquering lust is not very easy, it is very tough. Even great sages like Vishwamitra Muni, even he, such a great sage, even he fell victim to lust. So therefore, unless we increase the component of Bhakti in our life, unless we ensure that we remain connected with Krishna. Connected with Krishna at every second in our life, unless we do that, we cannot help but be conquered by the forces of lust and anger. So we have to understand this, every second, every moment in my life, in my day has to be filled with Krishna, with devotional service to Krishna. Even if one second you give, lust will enter. You see Vishwamitra Muni was deep in meditation. He had shut out the whole world. I don't want any connection with the material world. Closed his eyes, cut off all his senses from the outside world, pratyahara, samadhi, deep within. And just for a moment, he heard the tinkling of the ankle bells of the Aksaras. Immediately his meditation broke and finished. Forgot all his spiritual life. So you see, even one moment of inattention can wreak havoc in our spiritual life.

**Summary:** The speaker advises filling every moment with remembrance of Krishna, particularly through chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, to prevent the entry of maya and lust.

So the lesson that we have to learn is, we have to fill our life constantly from every moment, eating, sleeping, waking, every moment, whatever we are doing, we have to keep remembering Krishna. And remembering Krishna in today's world is very easy. It is very easy. How do we do that? Chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Constantly throughout the day we keep chanting Krishna's holy name. Then what will happen? We will remain connected with Krishna and there will be no scope for maya to enter, for lust to enter.

Prabhupada created this movement, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness... to give us this opportunity to learn, to get trained, how to remain always in remembrance of Krishna and to never forget him."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of Krishna as the sun and maya as darkness to illustrate that the presence of Krishna dispels maya, and emphasizes that ISKCON was created to train individuals to constantly remember Krishna.

Krishna sudhya sama, maya hoy andhakaar. Krishna is like the brilliant sun. Effulgent sun. You know how when the sun, one sun rises in the morning in the east, what happens? All the darkness of the night is dispelled. Now it is night time, right? We need so many lights to dispel the darkness in this room alone. Outside, if you look outside the window, it is dark outside. You see how it is? So many lights can dispel the darkness only in this one room. Now the whole universe, whole earth, can dispel the darkness. So many lights can dispel the darkness only in this one room. The one sun, one bulb of the sun rises in the morning, entire earth, the darkness vanishes. Whatever horizon we are, the eastern horizon. So you see that one star, one bulb of the sun is enough to drive away all the darkness. You don't need multiple suns. In the morning time, once the sun has risen, you don't need a torch. You don't need to switch on the light. Let me dispel all the darkness in this room. Because there is only one sun. Moment the sun rises, you switch off all the light. No more electricity needed. So Krishna Surya Sama, Krishna is like Surya. One Krishna is enough, brilliant like the sun. Maya Hoi Andhaka and Maya, material energy, is like the darkness of the night. Yaha Krishna Taha Nahi Maya Adhikaar. Wherever Krishna is, there is no Maya Adhikaar. Where Krishna is present, there the darkness of Maya cannot enter. So if you want to become free from lust, the only way is, we have to practice how every second of my life, I will remember Krishna and nothing else. And Prabhupada created this movement, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, this Hare Krishna movement, for exactly that purpose. To give us this opportunity. To learn, to get trained, how to remain always in remembrance of Krishna and to never forget him.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes that overcoming lust requires developing devotional service to Krishna through sustained practice, training, and sincere effort, emphasizing that there are no shortcuts.

This is the whole idea. So in a simple way, if you have to get free from lust, only way is to develop devotional service to Krishna. And that also won't happen overnight. It takes several years of practice and it requires lot of training. And constant loving association with a pure devotee like Srila Prabhupada to overcome lust. But it is possible. Many great personalities in the past have become free from lust. If you look at Prabhupada, Prabhupada is a brilliant example of a person who is completely free from lust. So these example of such great personalities like Haridas Thakur, Srila Prabhupada, Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, Narada Muni, all these personalities, these examples are there in our scriptures as well as in our lives. We get to see such personalities so that we know it is possible to become free from lust. But I should be ready to take that austerity, that tapasya and undergo the whole training process. There is no shortcut. It requires lot of hard work and there is no magic. You come to me, you give me some money and I will give you some basma and overnight you will become free from lust. Nothing like that is going to happen. You have to do lot of hard work. You have to show your sincerity to Krishna

### devotion, attachment, spiritual master, fall down

**Key Quote:** "If you were this much attached to Krishna, how much good you might achieve."
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa narrates the story of Bilvamangal Thakur, a pure devotee who fell from a high spiritual platform due to attachment, and how his spiritual master, through the words of a prostitute, Chintamani, reignited his devotion.

Hare Krishna! Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki Jai! Often, Srila Prabhupada narrated the real-life story of Srila Bilvamangal Thakur. Bilvamangal Thakur was a great pure devotee of Krishna, who is said to have lived around the 8th century, although the exact timelines of his birth are not known. He was a pure devotee who came in the line of Srila Vishnuswami, who is an Acharya of the Rudra Sampradaya. Bilvamangal Thakur is said to have lived for almost 700 years, and he composed many wonderful bhajans on Krishna. His most famous work, of course, is the Krishna Karnamrita, which Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu treasured. Bilvamangal Thakur was born into a wealthy Brahmana family, but instead of developing saintly character as a qualified Brahmana, he became attached to a prostitute, Chintamani. He was so attached to the prostitute that he couldn't stay even one day without meeting her. One day, it so happened that Bilvamangal Thakur's father passed away. He was forced to stay back for the funeral rites for his father, but he was still restless to meet Chintamani. You can imagine, Bilvamangal Thakur's father has passed away, and he is still itching to meet Chintamani. That shows how attached he was to the Brahmana family. As soon as the rituals were completed, Bilvamangal Thakur rushed to meet Chintamani the same day because it had already gotten late. By that time, it was already evening and it had started raining heavily. Despite the downpour, Bilvamangal Thakur hurried to meet Chintamani. On the way, he had to cross a river, and when he reached the river, he found that the river was swollen due to the heavy rain, and there was no boat either to take him across the river. Finding no other alternative, what did he do? He jumped into the river, but the current was so fierce, it started sweeping him away. Clutching desperately here and there, he fortunately found something floating in the furious spate of the river waters. Taking it to be a log of wood, he clung on to it for dear life and somehow managed to reach the other bank. With great relief, Billumangal Thakur got out of the water and on some instinct, he turned back and when he turned back, he was horrified to see that what he thought was a log of wood he had been clinging on to was actually a corpse, a dead body. Anyway, he shrugged it off and continued on to Chintamani's house. By now, it was pretty dark and when he reached Chintamani's house, he found that the gate was locked. Since it had become dark and it was raining torrentially, Chintamani thought that Billumangal Thakur would not come today and so, she had locked the main gate and it was pouring because of the sound, the thunder, the lightning, the rain, not being able to attract the attention of anyone inside the house. What happened? Billumangal Thakur became desperate. He tried knocking the gate, he tried doing this, that, but he couldn't capture the attention of anyone within the house. Then, when he was looking around, he luckily found a rope hanging down from the compound wall. So, he was able to get out of the house and he was able to immediately latched on to it, climbed up the wall and jumped over. And after jumping over, when he looked back, he realized that it was not a rope, it was a snake. He had narrowly missed being bitten by the snake to death. Heaving a sigh of relief, he walked up to the house and knocked on the door. Finally, he had reached his destination. What an adventure it had been. Chintamani opened the door, wondering who would have come to her house in the downpour. She was stunned to see Billumangal Thakur standing there. He then narrated to her how he had risked his life not once but twice despite his father's having passed away to come to her doorstep. When Chintamani heard this, she said, if only you had this much attachment to Krishna, your life would have been so glorious. Something like that. Suddenly, somewhere a switch got flipped inside. Billumangal Thakur, without wasting another moment, he turned and left her, never to return. He went on to Sri Vrindavan Dham and the rest, as they say, is history. Srila Prabhupada explains this incident in the book, Path of Perfection, in chapter 8. There, Srila Prabhupada says, in this regard, there is the example of Billumangal Thakur, who in his previous life was elevated almost to premabhakti, the highest platform of devotional service. However, since there is always a chance for a fall down, somehow or other he fell down. In his next life, he was born in a very rich brahmana family in accordance with the principle enunciated in the sixth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verse 41. Unfortunately, as is often the case with rich boys, he became a prostitute hunter. Yet, it is said that his spiritual master instructed him through his prostitute, saying, oh, you are so attached to this mere flesh and bones. If you were this much attached to Krishna, how much good you might achieve. Immediately, Billumangal Thakur resumed his devotional service. So, you see, what is Srila Prabhupada saying? The words of the prostitute, Chintamani, had such a profound life-transforming effect on Billumangal Thakur. Why? Because it was actually, Billumangal Thakur's Diksha Guru speaking through her. Srila Prabhupada explained this principle in greater detail in this lecture on the Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6, verses 35 through 45, recorded on February 20, 1969 in Los Angeles. Listen to what Srila Prabhupada explained.

**Key Quote:** "Finish your business in this life."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the spiritual master will always come back until his disciples achieve God-realization, but disciples should be serious in their practice and not take advantage of the spiritual master's mercy.

I have heard it said that the spiritual master will always come back until his devotee, his disciples, has achieved God-realization. Can you explain that? Yes, but don't try to take advantage of it. Don't try to give trouble to your spiritual master. Finish your business in this life. That is especially meant for those who are slack. A devotee or a disciple should be serious in serving spiritual master. If he is intelligent, he should know that why should I act in such a way that my spiritual master has to take the trouble to reclaim me again? Let my business be finished in this life. That should be the right way of thinking. Not that, I am sure my spiritual master will come. Let me do... That's it. No. So if you have got any, I mean to say, affection for the spiritual master, then you should finish your business in this life so that he may not come again to see you. Is that all right? Don't take advantage of this leave-in. Rather be serious to finish your business. That is a fact.

**Key Quote:** "Immediately he took you back to Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada reiterates the story of Bilvamangal Thakur, emphasizing the spiritual master's responsibility to reclaim fallen disciples, but also stressing that disciples should not take advantage of this.

There is an instance of Bhīlāmamara Ṭhākura. Bhīlāmamara Ṭhākura was in his previous life elevated to almost prema-bhakti, highest platform of devotional service. But there is always a chance of fall down. So somewhere or other he fell down. And next life he was born in a very rich family. I will tell you. As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, śucināṁ śrīmatāṁ kīḥ. So he was born in a rich brāhmaṇa family, but he became naturally as rich boys, become attached to woman-hunter. So it is said that his spiritual master instructed him through his prostitute. At the right moment, his spiritual master said through that prostitute, you are so much attached with this flesh and bone. If you had been attached so much with Kṛṣṇa, how would you have achieved it? Immediately he took you back to Kṛṣṇa. So that responsibility is for the spiritual master. But we should not take advantage of that. That is not very good. We should try yasya-prasāda bhagavata-prasāda. We should not try and put our spiritual master in the position that he has reclaimed me from prostitutes house. But he has to do that because he accept the childhood. He has got the responsibility.

### Diksha Guru, devotional service, Krishna Prema, responsibility

**Key Quote:** "It is the duty of the Diksha Guru to take the disciple to Krishna."
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa explains that the Diksha Guru has the duty to take the disciple to Krishna, even if it means returning to the material world after disappearing from it.

So, in this lecture, you have heard Śrīla Prabhupāda explain that sofa-mangal Thakur was elevated to the stage of bhāva bhakti in his previous life. But because he could not complete the process and reach the stage of Krishna Prema, he had to take one more birth. And he took his birth in a pious, wealthy Brahmana family, so that there would be no obstacles to his resuming his devotional service. But unfortunately, he deviated. Then his Diksha Guru had to act through Chintamani to reignite the fire of devotional service in his life. An ordinary person's words cannot bring about such a vast transformation in a person's life like Chintamani's words did in Billumangal Thakur's life. Hence, it is clear that it was not Chintamani. It was Billumangal Thakur's Diksha Guru who spoke to him through Chintamani. And therefore, there was a sudden 180-degree transformation in his life, as if a light switch had suddenly started. He had been flipped, flooding a dark room with light within a split second. Srila Prabhupada reiterated this in another lecture given on the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 6, Chapter 3, verse number 18, recorded on 11th February 1971 in Gorakhpur. See, my Guru Maharaj used to say like that, that finish this business in this life. Don't delay for the next life. He was telling also, that don't give me trouble again to come here to Delhi Gali. That is the response of the spiritual master. Spiritual master's response to this is to take the disciple to Krishna until he is able to help him. That is the bodhisattva, just like Billumangal Thakur. The spiritual master delivered him, taking the shape of a process. So here, you heard Srila Prabhupada say that it is the verdict of the Shastras, and also that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswathi Thakur said, that it is the duty of the Diksha Guru to take the disciple to Krishna. And, if the disciple does not perfect his life, then the Diksha Guru has to again come to take the disciple to Krishna. Codex Prorogative – försörtằng Profetikur the disciple to Krishna. Come means come from where? Where does the spiritual master come from? It means that if the spiritual master has disappeared and the disciple doesn't perfect himself but the disciple has to take one more birth, then the spiritual master, the Diksha Guru who has gone to the spiritual world has to come back to take the disciple back to the spiritual

**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa quotes Srila Prabhupada saying he is ready to come back from Goloka Vrindavan to deliver his disciples, emphasizing the importance of staying connected to the disciplic succession.

world. In this letter to Brahmananda, dated 15 November 1969, Srila Prabhupada said this, regarding your request for your deliverance from the clutches of Maya, please rest assured of being delivered because we have captured the strong chain of disciplic succession. This chain is coming down from the highest platform Krishna, just like a rope comes down the well so that anyone who may catch the rope from any position is sure to be delivered. So our aim should be to not give up the rope. We must capture the rope very tightly. Then our deliverance is assured. So far as I am concerned, in relationship with my disciples who are so kindly cooperating with me in the matter of my rendering service to my spiritual master, for them I am always ready to come back from Goloka Vrindavan. Come back from where? Come back from Goloka Vrindavan if they are not delivered along with me. So don't be worried about the clutches of Maya. Here Srila Prabhupada says that if his disciples are not delivered, Prabhupada will personally come back from Goloka Vrindavan to take them back there. As the Diksha Guru, Srila Prabhupada has revealed that after his disappearance, he will be in Goloka Vrindavan. And although he is so far away, Goloka Vrindavan is so far away, he still keeps the closest connection to the Lord. keeps meticulous track of his disciples from Goloka. And if he sees that any of his disciples are not able to progress, then he is ready to again come down from Goloka to take us back. Just like Billumangal Thakur's Diksha Guru saw that he had deviated from devotional service in his next life and the Diksha Guru spoke through the prostitute to bring him back to the right path. Similarly, Srila Prabhupada is also ready to continue to guide and instruct his disciples personally till they also return to Goloka where Srila Prabhupada is. And Srila Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "If somebody does not go, then I shall have to come back to take him there."
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa continues to emphasize Srila Prabhupada's promise to take his disciples back to Goloka, even if it requires him to return, and reiterates the story of Bilvamangal Thakur to illustrate the Diksha Guru's role.

reiterated the same fact in another letter to Tushna Krishna written on 14th of December 1972. There Srila Prabhupada wrote, why you only want to be in the spiritual sky with Siddha Swarupa? If Siddha Swarupa can go, why not everyone? Siddha Swarupa will go, you will go, Shyamasundara will go, all others will go. We will have another ISKCON there. Of course, Mr. Nair must stay. And if somebody does not go, then I shall have to come back to take him there. One should remember this and every one of my disciples should act in such a way that they may go with me and may not have to come back to take another birth. Again, here Srila Prabhupada confirmed the fact that Srila Prabhupada will come down from Goloka to take his disciples back to Goloka. So, as Srila Prabhupada mentioned, as per Shastra and as per Sadhu, the Sadhu meaning Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, it is a principle that the Diksha Guru who is a resident of the spiritual world must take the responsibility of taking the disciple back to Krishna, even if it means that the Diksha Guru has to come back to the material world to do so. This means that after the spiritual world, the Diksha Guru has to come back to the material world to do so. After the spiritual master disappears, it is not that he is no longer performing the function of the Diksha Guru. It is not that the Diksha Guru becomes no longer living. The Diksha Guru continues to perform the role of the Diksha Guru just like when he was in flesh and blood. In the vivid example of Biloba Mangal Thakur, his Diksha Guru saw that Biloba Mangal Thakur needed one specific intervention to bring him back to the path of Bhakti. So, the Diksha Guru implemented the Diksha Guru. The Diksha Guru implemented the intervention by speaking specific words through the prostitute so that Biloba Mangal Thakur would rekindle his forgotten devotion to Krishna. This was a very specific input required and which was given by his Diksha Guru. The Diksha Guru was his guru right from his previous life and the Diksha Guru was not present as a living guru physically before Biloba Mangal Thakur. Yet, that Diksha Guru acted.

**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa explains the function of the Diksha Guru, even after physical disappearance, to administer specific realizations to the disciple, ultimately leading to Swaroopa Siddhi and return to Goloka.

In the most suitable way for his spiritual benefit. This then is the function of the Diksha Guru. The Diksha Guru may not be physically present. He may no longer be a quote-unquote living guru. He might have gone back to the spiritual world like Srila Prabhupada says about himself. But still, the Diksha Guru's responsibility doesn't end. He has to keep administering specific realizations to the disciple so that the Diksha Guru keeps inspiring the disciple till he reaches Goloka. If necessary, the Diksha Guru may even have to again descend to the material world to take the disciple back. It is not that the Diksha Guru has chanted on the beads and chosen a name, presided over a yajna and that's it. It doesn't end there. The relationship is eternal. In fact, Srila Prabhupada says that, we will have one more ISKCON in Goloka. Meaning that even after we return to Goloka, Srila Prabhupada will continue to inspire the disciples, instruct us, train us, guide us in our service to Radha and Krishna in Goloka. That means the Diksha Guru gives Divedjana or transcendental realization within the heart of the disciple eternally in this material world also, in the spiritual world also. And this transcendental realization that the spiritual master Diksha Guru reveals within the heart begins with I am not the body up till the point of realizing my Swaroopa. If I have not realized my Swaroopa how can I go to Goloka? Unless you have attained Swaroopa Siddhi, how can you go back to Goloka? That means the Diksha Guru takes the responsibility of giving specific realizations to the disciple right from you are not the body till revealing who you are in the spiritual world. And unless the Diksha Guru himself is a Swaroopa Siddha, how can he give Swaroopa Siddhi to his disciple? So when Srila Prabhupada says that he will come back from Goloka, he will come back from Goloka. It means he is staying in Goloka in his Swaroopa. And when he says he will take us, his disciples back to Goloka, that means he will give us Swaroopa Siddhi. He will reveal to us who we are in the spiritual world at the right time. Srila Prabhupada has unequivocally and boldly, confidently stated this. Actually this is the main and most important function of the Diksha Guru which is to administer Divyajjana, divine divine awareness and one's true self-realization. That is the main function. So, what is the main and most important function of the Diksha Guru which is to administer Divyajjana

### Diksha Guru, Divya Jnana, Srila Prabhupada, Ritvik system, ISKCON

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada administers that for each of his disciples directly in their heart."
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa contrasts Srila Prabhupada's potency as Diksha Guru, even after his disappearance, with the perceived limitations of Diksha Gurus in ISKCON Mumbai, questioning the GBC's accusations against the Ritvik system.

in a customized manner specific to each disciple so that he goes back all the way to Goloka. This cannot be done by a Diksha Guru. Just like Bilumangal Thakur required a specific kind of dose of instruction which would awaken him and his Diksha Guru accordingly administered it through the prostitute. So, the Diksha Guru is a transcendental personality who is not limited by time and space. He is not dependent on being a quote-unquote living Guru to administer such specific Divya Jnana in the heart of his disciples. According to each disciple, no matter how many thousands of disciples he may have, he knows what instruction each disciple specifically requires. And Srila Prabhupada administers that for each of his disciples directly in their heart through different Diksha Gurus in his Khan, through his books, lectures, letters, etc. and also through other living entities in the world. And for all this, Srila Prabhupada need not even be physically present before the disciple. He need not even be quote-unquote living Guru. Just like thousands of Prabhupada's disciples before 1977 never even met Srila Prabhupada in their life or might have had just a brief glimpse of Prabhupada. But they all got wonderful spiritual realization, Divya Jnana and progressed steadily in spiritual life. In fact, Srila Prabhupada is not even bound to be within this material world in order to perform this role of Diksha Guru. He can be in Goloka and still he can do this for all his disciples whom he has initiated through the Rithvik system. That is the power and potency of Srila Prabhupada. That is how potent Prabhupada is. That is how powerful Prabhupada is. He can perform his function of Diksha Guru without having to be a quote-unquote living Guru. In comparison, the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON Mumbai group are so limited in their potency that they must be quote-unquote living in order to act as Diksha Guru. Once a Diksha Guru in ISKCON passes away, he stops being a Diksha Guru. So, you see how limited their potency is. But funny thing is, ISKCON Mumbai group's GBC accuses those who follow Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order saying that the Rithvik system renders Srila Prabhupada impotent. Now, you please tell us who is really potent? Srila Prabhupada or the unauthorized Diksha Gurus in ISKCON? Please let us know your thoughts in the comment section below about who is more potent? Srila Prabhupada or the unauthorized Diksha Gurus? Yes, go ahead. We are waiting for your comment. Please do it right now. There, you put in your comment. Great.

**Key Quote:** "Can the GBC confirm and assure unequivocally that all their NOC Diksha Gurus can impart realization in the hearts of their disciples up to giving them Swaroopa Siddhi?"
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa challenges the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai to confirm the potency of their approved Diksha Gurus, questioning their ability to deliver disciples to Goloka and impart Swaroopa Siddhi.

So, continuing our discussion, this raises another question. On the unauthorized Guru system in ISKCON, can the GBC of the ISKCON Mumbai group confirm that the Diksha Gurus that they give no objection to, will those Diksha Gurus deliver all their disciples to Goloka? We don't want to hear from rank and file devotees. We want the answer from the GBC. Will the GBC confirm that if the Diksha Gurus disciples in ISKCON do not go back to Goloka and are forced to again take birth in the material world, all the GBC NOC Diksha Gurus in ISKCON will come back from Goloka to take their disciples back? Can the GBC confirm this? Well, for that, first, the GBC has to confirm that all their NOC Gurus are going to go to Goloka after they are passing away. Can the GBC give such an assurance? Forget about the future. Can the GBC confirm that all their NOC Diksha Gurus who have passed away till now, are all of them in Goloka, monitoring their disciples and administering specific realizations for their disciples, just like Billo Mangal Thakur's Diksha Guru or as Shaila Prabhupada himself confirmed that he too is doing. Can the GBC confirm that all the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON who have passed away are doing this for their disciples after they have passed away? Some of the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON have 1000, 2000 or someone even 50,000 disciples. Are those unauthorized Diksha Gurus administering specific, Divya Jnana according to the specific requirement of each of their disciples, just as Shaila Prabhupada is doing even today for his disciples whom he initiated before 1977, as also for those disciples after 1977 through the Ritvik system of initiations, Prabhupada is still doing it. So, all those quote-unquote living Gurus who are there for their 1000, 2000, 10,000, 50,000 disciples, are they able to do while they are quote-unquote living? Which Prabhupada is doing without having the need to be a living Guru? If they cannot do that, even when they are living, then what is the use of initiating 50,000 disciples? Can the GBC confirm and assure unequivocally that all their NOC Diksha Gurus can impart realization in the hearts of their disciples up to giving them Swaroopa Siddhi? Well, if they have to give Swaroopa Siddhi to their disciples, the unauthorized Diksha Gurus in ISKCON first must be Swaroopa Siddhas themselves. But the GBC in their resolution number 409 of 2004 have said, when the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating, it does not thereby endorse him as an Attham Adhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. That means the GBC has already admitted, they have already confessed that their NOC Diksha Gurus have not achieved any realization. That means the unauthorized Diksha Gurus in ISKCON are not even on the stage of having realized that they are not the body. Forget about Swaroopa Siddhi. That is too far off. So, then what is the potency of the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON? If they are not Swaroopa Siddhas themselves, how will they give Swaroopa Siddhi to their disciples? And how will they, after their disappearance, how will they give specific realization to their disciples and give them Swaroopa Siddhi and take them back to Godhead?

### Diksha Guru, pure devotee, GBC, ISKCON, Srila Prabhupada, Goloka

**Key Quote:** "Then both of them will go to hell like blind men leading the blind."
**Summary:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa questions the GBC's approval of Diksha Gurus who are not pure devotees, citing Srila Prabhupada's warning about the blind leading the blind, and expresses confidence in Srila Prabhupada's ability to deliver his disciples to Goloka.

What are the unauthorized Diksha Gurus doing for their disciples in ISKCON? Other than chanting on their beads and selecting their names, which is actually the role of the Rithvik. They accuse the Rithvik system of rendering Srila Prabhupada impotent. But what is their GBC NO objection Guru system rendering their Diksha Gurus? Is it making them potent? And if the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON are not potent to take anyone back to Goloka, forget about taking their Diksha Gurus. If they are not potent in going back to Goloka themselves, then what is the future of all their disciples? Srila Prabhupada in his letter to Tushta Krishna wrote this on 14th of December 1972. As for your next question, can only a few pure devotees deliver others? Anyone, if he is a pure devotee, he can deliver others. He can become spiritual master. But unless he is on that platform, he should not attempt it. Then both of them will go to hell like blind men leading the blind. So, unless one is a pure devotee, one must not attempt to become a Diksha Guru. But the GBC has confessed in resolution number 409 that none of their Diksha Gurus are pure devotees. So what is the GBC doing then? By giving NOC to those who are not pure devotees, as per their own admission, can they become Diksha Gurus? We will leave the responsibility of finding the answers for all these questions to you. As far as we, the devotees of Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group are concerned, we are blissfully confident that Srila Prabhupada will definitely take us back to Goloka since we are his disciples via the Rithvik system of initiations implemented according to Srila Prabhupada's July 9th, 1977 order. Of course, that also places a very heavy responsibility on our shoulders too as disciples of Srila Prabhupada to perfect our lives within this very lifetime and not create a situation where Srila Prabhupada has to come back to the material world to deliver us. So, let us seriously take shelter of our Diksha Guru, our Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada and execute our duties diligently following all the instructions of Srila Prabhupada and we can rest assured that Srila Prabhupada will personally take us to the point of Swaroopa Siddhi, to the point of Krishna Prema, to the point of our returning to Goloka and he will continue to guide and instruct and train us in our services to Radha and Krishna in Goloka Vrindavan.

**Key Quote:** "From childhood, if a man is educated that woman is not an object of enjoyment, she is to be respected like mother and she is worthy always of your protection, not your exploitation."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Manu Samhita's view on women's protection and Chanakya Pandit's teaching on respecting women as mothers, emphasizing protection over exploitation.

When Manu Samhita, Manu is saying that women have to be always protected, they should not be given independence, meaning they should not be let free. They should not be let free without protection at any point of time. Women are always to be accorded special protection. Not only that, we combine it with the statement which is given by Chanakya Pandit, who says that a learned person should always look upon every woman other than his wife as his mother. Now, from childhood, if a man is educated that woman is not an object of enjoyment, she is to be respected like mother, and she is worthy always of your protection, not your exploitation.

**Key Quote:** "And that is how in the olden times, women were given so much respect that if a man were to abduct a woman, then according to the Shastras, the husband of that woman can go and kill that abductor."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the high regard for women in ancient times, illustrating it with the example of Lord Ramachandra killing Ravana for abducting Sita, highlighting the consequences of disrespecting women.

Then what happens? Every man will have great respect towards every woman who is not, even though the woman may not be related to him. And that is how in the olden times, women were given so much respect that if a man were to abduct a woman, then according to the Shastras, the husband of that woman can go and kill that abductor, and there is no sin involved in this. And the most brilliant example of this is how Lord Ramachandra, he killed Ravana. Not only Ravana, Ravana's entire dynasty. Whoever stood in support of Ravana, all of them were killed by Ramachandra. For what? Just because of his one wife, Sita, who had been abducted by Ravana. Lord Ramachandra set the example.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the high position of women's honor in society according to Manusamhita, stating that disrespect towards women leads to conflict, citing Ramayana and Mahabharata as examples.

From this, what we can understand is the honor of a woman was accorded the highest position in the society, according to Manusamhita. Woman was to be highly respected. Children had to be respected. Women had to always take her wish as their command. This was the actual spirit of Manu's instructions in the Manusamhita. It was not for any sort of suppression or oppression or exploitation of any kind. Women were given so much respect, and whenever women would be disrespected, then it would result in some war or the other. Even Mahabharata, the war of Mahabharata and the war of Ramayana, both of the wars, if you see, were fought because the honor of a woman was insulted.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Mahabharata and Ramayana wars, explaining that they were fought to protect the honor of Draupadi and Sita, respectively, emphasizing the importance of following Manusamhita as Dharma and respecting women.

The Pandavas and the Kauravas were living together. Little bit skirmishes here and there used to happen. Little bit fight here and there used to happen, but it never used to be a full-fledged fight to death. But the day the Kauravas decided to insult Draupadi by trying to disrobe her, that day the seeds of their death in the battle were sown. That was the instance where the Pandavas decided that the Kauravas have to die because of the insult they have committed to Draupadi. Similarly, the day Ramana kidnapped Sita, that day his death was written. We can understand both the battles, both the great battles in our history have happened to protect the honor of a woman. That means the Manusamhita and the people in those days used to live by the Manusamhita, by the codes of the Manusamhita. That was the Dharma. Path of Dharma means we have to follow the Manusamhita. So people understood the spirit of Manu's instructions, and accordingly, the woman was given such high respect.

**Key Quote:** "That is real humility."
**Summary:** This segment defines humility according to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as giving respect to others without expecting any in return.

So, humility, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has defined, what is the definition of humility? Humility means Amanina Manadena. So, humility, the definition of humility given by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is very simple. What is that? To Amanina, we don't expect any respect for ourselves, and Manadena, we give all respect to others. Not that I don't expect any respect for myself and I don't respect you also. No, I give you all respect, and even though you may not respect me, I don't expect any respect for myself. Some people, they give lot of respect to others. Why? So that they also get respect in return. So, like it's said in English, give respect and take respect. So, why are they giving respect? So that they can take respect. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is saying, no, only give respect. Don't expect or take any respect for yourself. That is real humility.

**Summary:** Real humility arises from understanding our position as eternal servants of Krishna through devotional service and studying scriptures.

So, real humility can come when we understand our truth, true position as servants, as eternal servants of Krishna. So, unless and until we understand our position as eternal servants of Krishna, real humility cannot take place in our heart. So, real humility is when we understand our insignificant position. So, by associating with devotees, by reading Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam, understanding the position of Krishna and understanding our miniscule insignificant position, we can become humble.

## How the GBC changed Deity worship in ISKCON | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa
**Speaker:** HG Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

### Deity worship, ISKCON history, GBC resolutions, Pancharatra Pradipa

**Content Type:** historical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This system was given a stamp of approval and finality by the GBC in the year 1995."
**Summary:** The speaker outlines the GBC's resolutions in 1989 regarding Deity worship, the formation of a research committee, and the publication of the Pancharatra Pradipa in 1995, detailing the procedures for Aarati as described in the manual.

On March 11, 1989, ISKCON Mumbai Group's GBC passed two resolutions regarding Deity worship in ISKCON, Resolutions No. 65 and 66. Resolution No. 65 reads that the GBC body hereby requests the following devotees to research on the basis of Guru, Sadhu and Shastra to help establish ISKCON policies regarding Deity worship – Bhanuswami, Bhakti Vidyapurna Swami, Atma-Tattva, Jananivas, Ashtaratha and Krishna Kshetra. Jagadeesha Goswami is appointed to coordinate the research work. This resolution was followed by Resolution No. 66 which read that the Deity worship research group and the full GBC body must approve the contents of the ISKCON Deity worship handbook before publication. So, in 1989, the GBC felt that Deity worship policies need to be set and for that they need the help of Shastra. A committee was made as per this decision, which in the following years, underwent some modifications to the constituent members of the committee. This committee did its research and submitted its report to the GBC. The GBC finally published the Deity worship manual in the year 1995 under the ISKCON GBC Press calling it the Pancharatra Pradipa. In this Deity worship manual, the procedure for Aarati is described as follows. In addition to the worship of Srila Prabhupada in his Guru Puja, one should also honour him when performing Aarati by presenting the Aarati items to Srila Prabhupada after presenting them to one's own spiritual master, then with the consciousness that you are offering it on behalf of your spiritual master and with the blessings of Srila Prabhupada and Lord Chaitanya, offer it with the full number of circles listed below to the main Deity. After offering the incense to the main Deity, offer it as Prasada to the Lord's associates in descending order and to the Guru Parampara Sr. to Jr. This may be done with seven or three circles for each personality depending on time allowance. Then distribute it with one or three circles to the assembled Vaishnavas as the Prasada of the Lord and his associates. So, as per the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group, Aarati has to be offered in descending order. And how to offer the Aarati to the Deity? That is also described in the Pancharathra Pradipa, which says under the heading, how to offer each item as follows. Offer all the items, except the chamara and fan, by moving them in clockwise circles while ringing a bell with your left hand above waist level, fixing your attention on the Deities. Lamp: How to offer a lamp? That is described here. Lamp: Offer four circles to the lotus feet, two circles to the navel, and three circles to the Lord's face. Then offer seven circles to the Lord's whole body. Then the second one: Argya in a conch. Offer three circles to the Lord's head and seven circles to the whole body of the Lord. Then pour a small amount of the offered Argya into the Visarjaniya Patra, small throat pot, before proceeding to offer Argya to the next personality. Aarati Argya, plain or scented water. Then comes the cloth. Offer seven times around the Lord's body. Flowers: Offer seven times around the Lord's body. Chamara: Wave before the Lord a suitable number of times. Fan: Wave before the Lord a suitable number of times. So in 1995, the GBC approved the Manual for Deity Worship where when a devotee offers Aarati, he presents the Aarati to his Guru, then to Srila Prabhupad as a matter of honoring them and taking blessings from them. Then the arathi actually starts by offering it to Krishna first. 4, 2, 3, 7 formula for lamparathi, 3, 7 formula for water, etc. The key point is that the arathi offering begins with offering to Krishna on behalf of your spiritual master and then the prasadam is offered to Radharani, then to Mahaprabhu, then to Nithyananda Prabhu and then to Srila Prabhupada and then to your Guru.

### Deity worship, Srila Prabhupada's instructions, GBC deviations, Aarati offering

**Key Quote:** "So, you see, no 4-2-3-7 formula. Straight seven circles. That's it. That means, the 4-2-3-7 aarti introduced by the GBC in the 90s is an outright deviation in deity worship."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the GBC's Aarati procedures with Srila Prabhupada's instructions, citing letters where Prabhupada emphasizes offering to the Guru first and using seven circles, arguing that the GBC's changes are deviations.

This system was given a stamp of approval and finality by the GBC in the year 1995. Now, we must note that Srila Prabhupada had already established a systematic and elaborate system of Deity worship in ISKCON. Srila Prabhupada not only established the standards of Deity worship, Srila Prabhupada also ran it under his personal supervision in all the temples in ISKCON from 1967 till 1977. That is 10 straight years, if not longer. And this same system that Srila Prabhupada established continued for another 18 years or so till 1995 when the Pancharatrapadeepa came out. So, what was the system that Srila Prabhupada established for offering aarti to the deities? What was the original system? Was it the same as that instructed by the GBC in the Pancharatrapadeepa? Let us look at a few of Srila Prabhupada's directions in this regard. In a letter to Aniruddha dated 14th of November 1968, Srila Prabhupada instructed, aarti is performed at one and a half hour before sunrise to awaken the deities. Each offering is made by moving it in seven big circles, starting at the lotus feet of the Lord and going clockwise round. So, you see, no 4-2-3-7 formula. Straight seven circles. That's it. That means, the 4-2-3-7 aarti introduced by the GBC in the 90s is an outright deviation in deity worship. Are you stunned? Hold your breath because the worst is yet to come. Next comes the sequence of offering the aarti. In another letter to Giriraj, dated 28th of May 1972, Srila Prabhupada instructed, so far your question regarding deity worship during aarti, everything should be offered first to the Guru. So, Srila Prabhupada instructed to offer first to Guru, not to Krishna. And in his letter to Hemavathy dated 1st April 1970, Srila Prabhupada gave even greater clarity on the sequence or order of doing the aarti. Srila Prabhupada wrote, You have asked some questions. The order of worshipping is 1st spiritual master, 2. then Lord Chaitanya, then Radha Krishna, as in the mantras or Bendeyam prayer. So, here, very clearly, Srila Prabhupada gave an even greater clarity on the sequence and the position of doing the aarti. Very clearly, Srila Prabhupada said that we have to follow the sequence of Vandeyam prayers. And what is the sequence of Vandeyam prayers? First Guru, which is Srila Prabhupada, then Savadhootham or Sri Nithyananda Prabhu, then Lord Chaitanya, then Radha and then finally Krishna. It is the ascending order, not the descending order which the GBC has now implemented in ISKCON. Descending way is the procedure which was established by Srila Prabhupada for Deity worship in ISKCON from 1967 till 1977. And ISKCON continued with that system till in the late 80s or 90s, the GBC decided to change it entirely. Both the sequence of offering Aarati by completely reversing the order to begin the Aarati with Krishna, and also the number of times from just 7 straight times to 4, 2, 3, 7 etc. This is an outright outrageous deviation by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group. What audacity they must be having to change the Deity worship system. Is there no one in ISKCON to question such pernicious deviations by the GBC? Don't the GBC understand they are playing with something? Are they playing with something more dangerous than dynamite with the Deities? What is everyone doing in ISKCON? Are they all sleeping?

### Bhoga offering, Srila Prabhupada's instructions, GBC deviations, Guru Parampara

**Key Quote:** "The GBC has completely changed the way of offering."
**Summary:** The speaker compares the GBC's instructions on Bhoga offering in the Pancharatra Pradipa with Srila Prabhupada's instructions, highlighting the GBC's emphasis on offering directly to the deities versus Prabhupada's instruction to offer through the spiritual master.

As if this itself were not enough, brace yourself for even worse deviation by the GBC. Look at what they did with the Bhoga offering procedure to the Deities. When it comes to Bhoga offering, the Pancharatara Pradipa of 1995, published by the ISKCON GBC Press states, dates, section called Offering the Bhoga. Offer the Bhoga and drinking water with a hand gesture to each deity, showing the plate and saying, My dear Lordships, Gaur Nithay, Jagannath Baldev Subhadra, etc., please accept this offering of nice food. My dear Lordships, Gaur Nithay, Jagannath Baldev Subhadra, etc., please accept this beverage. Then the Pancharatra Pratipa states, While ringing a bell, chant the Pranam prayers to your spiritual master three times, begging permission to assist him in serving the deities. After offering everything to the deities like this, the Pancharatra Pratipa instructs the devotee as follows, Leave the deity room and chant the Gayatri mantras. You may chant all the Guru-given mantras at this time. Meditate on the Lord Yudhisthira. After the offering is completed, the bhoga is offered to the deities and then permission from the guru is sought to assist him in serving the deities. When removing the prasadam plates, the Pancharatra Pratipa instructs, Offer the lord's prasada remnants to the spiritual master and the Lord's associates. After this the plates are to be removed. So, the system here too is to offer the bhoga first to the deities and then offer their prasadam to Shaila Prabhupada and to the Diksha Guru. Descending process once more. Now again, what was the system Shaila Prabhupada set up and ran for 10 years or more in ISKCON and which continued in ISKCON till about 1995? Let us look at what Shaila Prabhupada instructed about offering bhoga to the deities. In this letter to Arundhati dated June 16, 1969, Shaila Prabhupada instructed, regarding your question about offering prasadam, whatever is offered to the deity, actually it goes through the spiritual master. The spiritual master offers to Lord Chaitanya and Lord Chaitanya offers it to Krishna. Then Radha Krishna eats or Jagannath eats. Then Chaitanya Mahaprabhu eats. Then the spiritual master eats and it becomes Mahaprasadam. So, when you offer something, you think like that and chant the Gayathri mantra and then everything is complete. At last, ring the bell, take out the plate and wipe the place where the plate was kept. The GBC in the Pancharatra Pradipa instructs the devotee to meditate that Krishna is eating the bhoga. Whereas, Shaila Prabhupada instructed to meditate on offering to the guru and the guru will offer to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu will offer to Krishna. The GBC has completely changed the way of offering. This is a shocking deviation by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group. In another letter to Jathurani, dated 15 February, 1968, Shaila Prabhupada wrote, regarding offering food. Shaila Prabhupada says the custom is to offer the foodstuff first to the spirit. Show of hands is the custom of offering foodstuff. This is also a custom, spiritual master. We cannot do anything directly. The spiritual master accepts the offering on behalf of his disciple and offers the same to Krishna. After Krishna's eating, the spiritual master eats it and then the devotees take it as Mahaprasadam. This is the system. Everything

### Guru Parampara, Offering to Krishna, GBC deviations, Spiritual Master

is offered to the spiritual master first with the prayer Nama Om Vishnupadaya. So, you see, Srila Prabhupada instructed that we cannot offer anything directly to Krishna. We must first offer to Guru. Srila Prabhupada reiterated this in another discussion after a lecture given on Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 6, Chapter 3, Verse 24, given on the occasion of his divine grace, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada's appearance day, recorded in Gorakhpur on February 15, 1970. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada's appearance day, recorded on 23 May 2001. Not a special thing if that. The process is that whatever you offer to the Deity, that is offered to Guru and Guru offers to his guru. This way goes to Krishna. You do not directly offer another Krishna. No. You have no right. Neither you accept. The picture of this acara is these. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Ācāryas fight there. Actually, one has to offer the plate to his guru, and he'll offer his guru. He'll offer his guru, his guru. In this way it will go. That is the process. You cannot directly approach Kṛṣṇa or other subordinates to Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. As we do, that is all right. The process is this. Not you or you. That is the process. You are not allowed. So, here, Srila Prabhupāda emphatically stated that we have no right to offer anything to Kṛṣṇa directly. Srila Prabhupāda gave such crystal clear instructions that we cannot offer anything directly to Kṛṣṇa, but we must offer to Guru first. And what did the GBC do in the Pancharatra Pradipa? They have said that the bhoga has to be offered directly to Kṛṣṇa. This is beyond shocking. This is mind-boggling. This is mind-numbing. Doesn't the GBC have any fear of Kṛṣṇa and Srila Prabhupāda's anger? Doesn't the GBC have any fear of Guru aparādhā? Doesn't the GBC have any fear in behaving as if they are better than their Guru Mahārāj, Srila Prabhupāda? Why on earth did the GBC have to make such a catastrophic change? Why did they deviate so monstrously? Was it because they knew?

### Guru fall-downs, GBC motives, Deviations, Srila Prabhupada as Diksa Guru, July 9th Order

**Key Quote:** "Devotees of our group, Śrīla Prabhupāda's ISKCON group, can rest assured that we strictly follow the standard of offering ārati and bhoga exactly as Śrīla Prabhupāda instructed."
**Summary:** The speaker speculates on the GBC's motives for the changes, linking it to Guru fall-downs and a potential desire to bypass offering through potentially fallen Gurus, and concludes by affirming his group's adherence to Srila Prabhupada's original instructions, particularly the July 9th order, emphasizing Prabhupada as the sole Diksa Guru.

That their Dīkṣa Gurus are not bona fide and offering through them would be outrightly rejected by Kṛṣṇa and so they reversed the whole procedure, offering directly to Kṛṣṇa? In most Guru fall-downs in ISKCON, the GBC tries to suppress the news, brushing it under the carpet. When the news finally breaks, several months of the Guru's deviation and fall-down would have already passed. So, naturally, questions will be raised by all the disciples of the fallen Guru as to what happened to all the bhoga and ārati that was being offered in the temples by His disciples from the time the Guru fell-down. Was it because the GBC had no answer for such questions that they found a quick-fix solution? Offer to Kṛṣṇa directly instead of offering to the Guru, and offer the Guru only prasādam. The Guru is the last person in the descending order in the line. So, even if Guru has fallen down, no problem. Is that the reason why the GBC made such an unbelievable change in the process of Deity worship? Look at what one deviation of the GBC, one disobedience of the GBC in 1978 to Śrīla Prabhupāda's July 9th order has led to. They are playing with the spiritual lives of the devotees without any qualms. Downright disgusting and appalling. How can the GBC even walk with their heads held high after such preposterous deviations? This deviation of the GBC is beyond atrocious. It is actually criminal. But it serves as a stark reminder of even just one deviation. How even just one disobedience of Śrīla Prabhupāda's one instruction, the July 9th, 1977 order to implement the Hrithik system of initiations, just that one deviation can cause so much havoc and destruction of the spiritual lives of thousands of devotees. Devotees of our group, Śrīla Prabhupāda's ISKCON group, can rest assured that we strictly follow the standard of offering ārati and bhoga exactly as Śrīla Prabhupāda instructed. Everything is offered to Śrīla Prabhupāda first because we follow the July 9th order of Śrīla Prabhupāda to implement Hrithik initiations. Hence, we happily and blissfully offer every ārati, every bhoga directly first to Śrīla Prabhupāda because Śrīla Prabhupāda is, Śrīla Prabhupāda was and Śrīla Prabhupāda will always, eternally be the sole dikṣa guru for every single devotee in our group, Śrīla Prabhupāda's ISKCON group.

**Key Quote:** "All simply vanished into thin air."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the pursuit of material pleasures and how Prabhupada's books can lead to detachment from these desires.

We spend our whole life trying to acquire material pleasures. We go to college, study very hard. Why? Because I want to get good marks. So we work hard, two years, three years, four years, doing our engineering or whatever, five years in case of doctors, study hard, write all the exams, day and night, burn the midnight oil and get good marks. Finally, at the end of it, we get a degree. And finally, when we come to the final year, we start preparing for the campus interviews. And then when you get a job, you start working hard. I should work in such a way that at the end of the year, my annual appraisals are good and I get either an increment or a promotion. But suddenly, when we read Prabhupada's books, what happened? All that passion we had for studying, getting good marks, getting a good job, what happened to all that? All simply vanished into thin air. No more you are interested. How? How? Because when we come in touch, we come in touch with the instructions of Prabhupada. Prabhupada is directly bestowing the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu upon us. In our heart, we lose all the consideration, all the attraction.

**Key Quote:** "My actual factual position is to be a servant of the servant of the servant of Krishna."
**Summary:** Rishabhadeva advises his sons about the futility of sense gratification, the temporary nature of the material body, and the importance of understanding one's true identity as a servant of Krishna.

Rishabhadeva tells his sons that in this material world, the people are engaged in all kinds of sinful activities because they want to satisfy their senses. In my opinion, this is not at all a good thing to do, because this body for which the people are toiling so hard is asat. It is temporary. At the point of death, one has to give up all the results of one's hard work and one has to go. And in the midst of this, we engage in so much enmity with other people. They don't think about the repercussions of their action. It can never satisfy them. After a certain point, they become frustrated, become very renounced, and they start saying, "I am the supreme Brahman." After some time, they will again come back to the material conception. We have to understand that my actual factual position is...

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada, on 9th of July, 1977, issued a written directive to the whole of ISKCON, detailing a Rithvik system of initiations to be followed in ISKCON."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the July 9th Directive, explaining its context and purpose regarding the Rithvik system of initiations.

Hare Krishna! Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki Jai! Srila Prabhupada, on 9th of July, 1977, issued a written directive to the whole of ISKCON, detailing a Rithvik system of initiations to be followed in ISKCON. In this directive, Srila Prabhupada appointed 11 devotees to act as his representatives, also called Rithviks, to initiate disciples on his behalf. The newly initiated disciples would be Srila Prabhupada's disciples. This directive, July 9th directive, was actually the outcome of a GBC meeting with Srila Prabhupada on 28th of May, 1977, where they asked Srila Prabhupada what would be the system of conducting initiations in ISKCON, particularly at the time when Prabhupada was no longer with us. Tamalkrishna Goswami, who was Srila Prabhupada's secretary at that time, typed out the directive on July 9th, 1977, and he took Prabhupada's signature on it, and he sent it out to all the GBCs and temple presidents at that time.

### Guru system, Tamal Krishna Goswami's claim, Contradiction, ISKCON's stance

**Key Quote:** "Tamalkrishna Goswami claimed that the July 9th letter was his letter, not Srila Prabhupada's."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Tamal Krishna Goswami's later claim that he authored the July 9th letter and the implications for the current Guru system in ISKCON.

However, after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance in November of 1977, in the year 1978, all the 11 people appointed as Rithviks were elevated by the GBC to become Diksha Gurus. They claimed at that time, that Srila Prabhupada had appointed or selected these 11 people as Diksha Gurus. Several years later, Tamalkrishna Goswami claimed that the July 9th letter was his letter, not Srila Prabhupada's. He said that Srila Prabhupada did not dictate or write the letter, but he did. So, it was his letter, not Srila Prabhupada's. So, he gave this explanation to justify his and others. He said that he was a Guru. Then, there is no other order by Srila Prabhupada for anyone to become a Guru in ISKCON. The letter was written by me. It was not dictated by Prabhupada. It was signed by me, and it's my letter. It's not Prabhupada's letter. So, it's just astounding to me that somehow my letter turns out to be the final order. And it was my suggestion that Prabhupada approved it, because I thought it would add weight to it, so people would know it was authorized. And it's just astounding how this becomes the basis of a new understanding of the Sampradaya. This video of Tamal Krishna Goswami is cited by the supporters of the self-appointed Guru system in ISKCON, saying that July 9th directive is not the final order, since it didn't come from Srila Prabhupada at all. It was Tamal Krishna Goswami's letter. So, it appears like ISKCON is now disowning

the July 9th Directive from Srila Prabhupada. Actually, with this argument, the self-appointed Gurus are honestly shooting themselves in the foot. The devotees of ISKCON Bangalore, of course, we are not buying this argument. However, for the sake of argument, let us hypothetically assume that the July 9th Directive was not Srila Prabhupada's letter, but it was Tamalkrishna Goswami's. Well, if this was Tamalkrishna Goswami's letter, then the question comes, who appointed the 11 people as Ritwiks? Was it Tamalkrishna Goswami? Did Tamalkrishna Goswami have the powers to appoint Ritwiks in ISKCON? Did he really have that kind of power? The answer is obviously a resounding no, because what was Tamalkrishna Goswami? Tamalkrishna Goswami, at that time, was just a mere secretary to Srila Prabhupada, nothing more. He had no power to appoint anyone in ISKCON. Forget about Ritwiks. The second question that crops up is that the July 9th Directive was addressed to all the GBCs and temple precedence. If this was not Prabhupada's letter, but Tamalkrishna Goswami's letter, did Tamal Krishna Goswami, just as a simple secretary, did he have the powers to direct the entire GBCs and temple presidents, which means the entire movement? Is there any order from Srila Prabhupada that said that he was conferring such powers on Tamal Krishna Goswami? In reality, none. Only Srila Prabhupada had such powers. Therefore, July 9 directive is

undeniably from Srila Prabhupada only. It cannot be from Tamal Krishna Goswami. Moreover, the 11 people named in the July 9 directive became diksha gurus in 1978. How? By claiming that Srila Prabhupada appointed them, selected them. The GBC resolution number 16 of 1978 stated, the GBC will consider each year at Gaurapurnima the appointment of new spiritual masters to be approved by a three-fourth vote. However, for 1978, no new spiritual master shall be appointed other than the 11 selected by Shela Prabhupada. So, in this resolution by the GBC, and mind you, Tamalkrishna Goswami was one of the GBC members. So, he has also been part of this resolution. So, in this resolution, it is clearly mentioned by the GBC, in which Tamalkrishna Goswami was also a member, that the 11 people were selected by Shela Prabhupada. At that time, why did Tamalkrishna Goswami not tell them? Why did he not tell them that these are not selected by Prabhupada, they are selected by me, because this is my letter, not Prabhupada's

letter. Why did he not tell at that time? But these 11 names, because you have to understand that these 11 names, which are mentioned here in this resolution, appeared only in the July 9th, 1977 directive, and that too as Ritwiks, not as Gurus. And there is no other document from Shela Prabhupada where these 11 names are mentioned. So, the 11 people becoming Gurus is coming out of the July 9th directive. And what is Tamalkrishna Goswami saying? Later, he is claiming that it is his letter. So, are these 11 Gurus appointed by Tamalkrishna Goswami? They claimed, these 11 people, they claimed that the July 9th directive was temporary, only till Shela Prabhupada's departure from this world. And after Prabhupada's departure, they were not selected. So, they were not selected. So, they were not selected. So, they became Gurus. So, the next question that comes is, if July 9th letter is Tamalkrishna Goswami's letter, then does it mean that the GBC resolution number 16, which says Prabhupada selected them, is that GBC resolution wrong? That Shela Prabhupada did not select the 11 people, but Tamalkrishna Goswami selected, appointed himself, turned 10 others to become Gurus after Shela Prabhupada's disappearance? Is this the meaning that the GBC of today wants to convey by disowning the July 9th directive as Tamalkrishna Goswami's letter? So, does that mean ISKCON is following Tamalkrishna Goswami in indicating no objections to devotees to become Diksha Gurus in ISKCON? What is ISKCON trying to tell us by disowning the July 9th directive? They are actually saying that Tamalkrishna Goswami is following Tamalkrishna Goswami, trying to question the validity of the Rithvik system by disowning the July 9th directive.

**Summary:** The speaker points out the contradictions between the GBC's 1978 resolution and their later confession in 1999 regarding the unauthorized zonal acharya system.

But instead, what are they achieving? All that they are achieving is to raise serious questions on their own unauthorized, self-appointed Guru system. ISKCON, GBC, in fact, contradicted their resolution number 16 of 1978 later on, and they confessed that Shela Prabhupada, as they claimed in resolution number 16 of 1978, was a Guru. So, Tamalkrishna Goswami is following Tamalkrishna Goswami in his confession. As they had claimed in that, it was not true. Shela Prabhupada did not select or appoint any Gurus in ISKCON in 1978. So, this confession came in 1999 from the GBC when they passed this resolution number 403, which reads, whereas Shela Prabhupada established ISKCON in 1966 and prior to his disappearance in November 1977, he stated in his will that there was no GBC is the ultimate managerial authority for the society. Unfortunately, shortly after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance, the GBC body, not Prabhupada, the GBC body allowed for an unauthorized zonal acharya system to evolve in ISKCON, elevating 11 exclusive successor diksha gurus.

**Key Quote:** "The GBC body allowed for elevating 11 exclusive successor diksha gurus."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the GBC's admission that they elevated the 11 successor diksha gurus, questioning their authority to do so and labeling the entire diksha guru system in ISKCON as unauthorized.

So, the GBC body allowed for elevating 11 exclusive successor diksha gurus. In 1978, what did the GBC say? They said Srila Prabhupada selected the 11 people. In 1999, the GBC is saying the GBC body allowed for elevating 11 diksha gurus. So, in this resolution, the GBC is clearly saying that they elevated 11 successor diksha gurus. That means, Srila Prabhupada did not appoint any diksha gurus in ISKCON. The GBC did. Now, what you see is, GBC in 1978 said that Srila Prabhupada selected the 11 people. In 1999, they said, no, Prabhupada did not do it. We did it. And now, in 2025, the GBC is saying that the July 9th directive is not Prabhupada's, it is Tamalkrishna Goswami's. Anyway, coming back to the point, the GBC is saying in 1999 that they elevated 11 people as diksha gurus. So, the question is, who gave the GBC the powers to appoint diksha gurus? Do they have any written order from Srila Prabhupada to do so? Or maybe in some conversation, Prabhupada authorized them. Can the GBC produce such an order? Reality is, there is no such order. Hence, entire diksha guru system in ISKCON,

is unauthorized because it is authorized by a GBC which has no authority to do so. The reality, what is the reality? The reality is that there was a discussion with Srila Prabhupada on 7th of July 1977, regarding who all could be appointed as his deputies or as his representatives. Srila Prabhupada mentioned all the 11 names in that conversation. And as Srila Prabhupada's secretary, and the Chairman of the GBC Entertainment Company, those names are all mentioned. It was not as that in the session 12 fr verändert the이면 of the Discipline, it was not as that in the audience. So, it was not as that in the session 12 years prior, and it was not as that in the session 13 years before. Tamal Krishna Goswami's duty to put it in writing and inform everyone about Srila Prabhupada's order. So, based on this order of Srila Prabhupada and based on the May 28th, 1977 meeting of the GBC with Srila Prabhupada, the July 9th directive was typed out by Tamal Krishna Goswami. Prabhupada saw that, Prabhupada signed it and then it was sent out to all the GBCs and TPs. Since Srila Prabhupada had signed it, all the GBCs and TPs who received the directive accepted it as Srila Prabhupada's order. Nobody thought it was Tamal Krishna Goswami's order. Actually, we devotees of ISKCON Bangalore also even today accept that it is Srila Prabhupada's order, it is not Tamal Krishna Goswami's order. So, please do not be swayed by such illegitimate claims by Tamal Krishna Goswami or the self-appointed Gurus of ISKCON. Please remain firm in following Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive for Diksha in ISKCON by Rittviks or representatives of Srila Prabhupada. Everyone in ISKCON is a disciple of Srila Prabhupada. No one is authorized to be Diksha Guru in ISKCON. Diksha Guru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai! Vishwa Guru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai! Hare Krishna!

**Summary:** The speaker claims that guru fall downs resulted from disobeying Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive regarding Rithvik initiations.

The GBC banned all of Srila Prabhupada's letters. Within one year, since 1978, devotees started developing doubts. The devotees in ISKCON had been deceived. Only the GBCs at that time knew of the July 9th directive. The guru fall downs are a direct reaction of disobeying Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive to conduct initiations in ISKCON via Rithviks on behalf of Srila Prabhupada.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the argument that the Rithvik system was invented by disgruntled devotees reacting to problems within ISKCON, including the zonal acharya system and mistreatment by leaders.

Hare Krishna Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai. One argument against the Rithvik system of initiations is that it came out as a reaction to some gurus falling down in ISKCON. Another version of this argument is that the reaction came due to the problems arising out of the zonal acharya system. Yet another version of this argument is that the reaction came due to the misbehavior of some leaders of ISKCON with rank and file devotees, mistreating them. This argument, in essence, maintains that the Rithvik system was a new invention developed by some devotees who were victims of some unsavory dealings by leaders or gurus in ISKCON. This is a very patronizing approach. Either the victims, or at least those who sympathized with the victims, came up with this new theory of Rithvikism. To put it bluntly, it was the invention of some disgruntled devotees of ISKCON. Gurus or leaders fell from grace or dealt harshly with some devotees and as a

**Summary:** The speaker continues to dissect the argument against the Rithvik system, highlighting the perceived patronizing approach and questioning the expulsion of devotees who support it.

result, the devotees came up with the idea of Rithvik initiations. This argument, in its various versions, attempts to discredit the Rithvik system as a post-1978 invention by some disgruntled devotees who wished well for the organization, but the solution they came up with was not correct. So, this was a patronizing approach, as if we sympathize with these devotees, but they were incorrect in the institution. Therefore, the Rithvik solution that they came out with. So, if you are sympathizing with the devotees, the victims of all this mistreatment within ISKCON, then why are you supporting the expulsion of such devotees, which is encapsulated by the GBC as a law in ISKCON? If you are really sympathetic towards the devotees, expulsion should not be the solution. Anyway, to get to the bottom of this

**Key Quote:** "In March of 1978, the GBC in their Resolution No. 16 lied to all the Vaishnavas of ISKCON that Srila Prabhupada selected 11 devotees to become Diksha Gurus."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the historical context, focusing on the GBC's alleged deception regarding the appointment of 11 Diksha Gurus and the banning of Srila Prabhupada's letters.

argument, we will have to go back in history to the year 1978. In March of 1978, the GBC, in their Resolution No. 16, lied to all the Vaishnavas of ISKCON that Srila Prabhupada selected 11 devotees to become Diksha Gurus. The GBC themselves have admitted to this in their apology to the institution in 1999 in Resolution No. 403. But in 1978, when they lied that 11 devotees had been selected as Diksha Gurus, all the devotees naively believed them. A few, whoever asked where Srila Prabhupada had selected them, were met with a standard response: there is an appointment tape. That tape, however, was never released. So, devotees left it at that. Moreover, we have to understand, in the aftermath of Srila Prabhupada leaving the world, all the devotees must have been in a state of shock and immense grief. Naturally, in that state of anguish, they couldn't be expected to look at things too critically. To add to this, the GBC banned all of Srila Prabhupada's letters in ISKCON. No devotee in ISKCON could read any of Srila Prabhupada's letters. Can you imagine that? It was forbidden.

**Key Quote:** "However, within one year since 1978, as the dust started settling in the horizon, devotees started developing doubts."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how devotees began to doubt the appointed gurus, focusing on Jadurani Mataji's investigation and her demand to hear the 'appointment tape' from Rameswar Swami.

So, there was no way any devotee could lay his hands on the July 9, 1977 Directive. They simply did not know that such an order existed. However, within one year since 1978, as the dust started settling in the horizon, devotees started developing doubts. In just two years, by 1980, Jadurani Mataji was convinced that these Gurus were not what they claimed to be, to be pure devotees. There were some mutually disrespectful dealings between two of the 11 Diksha Gurus, which Jadurani Mataji happened to witness. That made her draw this conclusion that they could not be pure devotees. At that time, Jadurani Mataji was serving as one of the top book distributors in Los Angeles temple, and Los Angeles temple was also the headquarters of BBT at that time. Rameswar Swami, who was one of the 11 Diksha Gurus, was heading the Los Angeles temple and the BBT at that time. So, Jadurani Mataji went to Rameswar Swami and from Rameswar Swami, she demanded proof about the appointment of the 11 Diksha Gurus by Srila Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "During that initiation ceremony, in the class, this was in the year 1980, he declared that he was only a devotee."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Rameswar Swami, after being confronted with the truth, conducted a Rithvik initiation, declaring himself a representative of Srila Prabhupada and the initiates as Srila Prabhupada's disciples.

She wanted to hear the appointment tape. Rameswar Swami was unable to evade her, and since he was in charge of BBT, he had access to all the tapes. And on her determinedly strong persuasion, he reluctantly gave Jadurani Mataji the recording of the May 28th GBC meeting with everyone. This is what they were calling as the appointment tape at that time. But after Jadurani Mataji heard the tape, it was clear to her that she and the rest of the devotees in ISKCON had been deceived. They had been duped. She confronted Rameswar Swami, who had no answers to her indignant questions. Backed with guilt, a highly repentant Rameswar Swami, what did he do? He removed his Vyasasana from the temple and he stopped this Guru Puja in the Los Angeles temple. A few days later, Rameswar Swami oversaw an initiation ceremony in the Los Angeles temple for a few devotees. During that initiation ceremony, in the class, this was in the year 1980, he declared that he was only a devotee. He was only a representative of Srila Prabhupada and all of the devotees who were getting initiated, they were disciples of Srila Prabhupada. Some of those devotees who were initiated in that ceremony till today, consider themselves disciples of Srila Prabhupada only, not of Rameswar Swami.

### GBC, Rameswar Swami, Jadurani Mataji, expulsion, zonal acharyas

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "They threatened to remove him from BBT and to expel him from ISKCON, unless he withdrew the Rithvik initiation."
**Summary:** The speaker details the GBC's reaction to Rameswar Swami's actions, his subsequent retraction under duress, and Jadurani Mataji's expulsion, highlighting that Rameswar Swami and Tamal Krishna Goswami were zonal acharyas.

Anyway, the moment the GBC came to know of this, a team of them landed up in Los Angeles, and they berated Rameswar Swami. They threatened to remove him from BBT and to expel him from ISKCON, unless he withdrew the Rithvik initiation, because this initiation what he conducted was actually a Rithvik initiation. Poor Rameswar Swami, under duress, called the devotees and announced that he was withdrawing his earlier statement and that the initiates were his disciples. And Jadurani Mataji, she was physically expelled from the temple. So, we can see that the first incident of Rithvik initiations was conducted in ISKCON in the year 1980. Coincidentally, in the same year, in a separate and unrelated incident, Tamal Krishna Goswami declared in the Topango Canyon discussions, the famous Topango Canyon discussions, he declared that Srila Prabhupada appointed only Rithviks and not Diksha Gurus. So, in both these cases, we see that Rameswar Swami, who conducted the first Rithvik initiation in ISKCON after 1978, as well as Tamal Krishna Goswami, who declared that Srila Prabhupada appointed only Rithviks and not Diksha Gurus, we see that both of them were not victims of any sort of improper behavior, nor were they at the receiving end of the zonal acharya system or any guru fall downs. In fact, they were themselves zonal acharyas. They were not some nondescript disgruntled devotees. They were Diksha Gurus and zonal acharyas. They were GBCs and top leaders in ISKCON.

### Rithvik system, Srila Prabhupada's order, July 9th directive, May 28 GBC meeting

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In reality, both of them independently raised the Rithvik initiation system because neither of them invented or came up with the Rithvik system."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that Rameswar Swami and Tamal Krishna Goswami advocated for the Rithvik system not as a reaction to problems, but because they knew it was Srila Prabhupada's order, referencing the July 9th directive and May 28th GBC meeting.

They obviously cannot be victims of themselves and their own system. Then, why did they come up with the Rithvik system? In reality, both of them independently raised the Rithvik initiation system because neither of them invented or came up with the Rithvik system, but instead, they both knew that this was what Srila Prabhupada had ordered on July 9, 1977. The Rithvik system of initiations was Srila Prabhupada's order. In fact, only the GBCs at that time knew of the Rithvik system and the July 9 directive. No one else in ISKCON knew about it because the letters were banned until much later after 1987. So, historical evidence does not support the theory that the Rithvik system of initiations was invented as a reaction to the problems of the zonal acharya system or the guru fall downs or due to the mistreatment of some devotees by some ISKCON leaders. Historical evidence clearly favors the fact that the Rithvik system of initiations was specifically ordered by Srila Prabhupada on July 9, 1977, particularly for that time when Srila Prabhupada is no longer with us, as it is clear from the May 28 GBC meeting with Srila Prabhupada, which is the precursor to the July 9 directive.

### Rithvik system, guru fall downs, July 9 directive, unauthorized guru system

**Key Quote:** "The guru fall downs and excesses of the zonal acharya system are a direct reaction of disobeying Shaila Prabhupada's July 9 directive to conduct initiations in ISKCON via Rithviks on behalf of Shaila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the Rithvik system is not a reaction to guru fall downs, but rather the guru fall downs are a result of disobeying Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive, emphasizing the directive as the sole authorization for Rithvik initiations.

For a detailed analysis of the May 28 meeting and the July 9 directive, please see the link below in the description. So, to conclude, from the history of ISKCON, we can see that the claim that the Rithvik system was a reaction to the guru fall downs and excesses of the zonal acharya system falls flat on its face. The Rithvik system has nothing to do with the guru fall downs. Whether gurus fell or not, irrespective of that, the Rithvik system is the only system authorized by Srila Prabhupada for carrying on initiations in ISKCON after his Thiro Bhava. Even if no gurus ever fell down in ISKCON, our stance will not change. In fact, rather than the Rithvik system coming up as a reaction to the guru fall downs or excesses of the zonal acharya system, the fact is the reverse. The guru fall downs and excesses of the zonal acharya system are a direct reaction of disobeying Srila Prabhupada's July 9 directive to conduct initiations in ISKCON via Rithviks on behalf of Srila Prabhupada. So, the claim that the Rithvik system of initiations is a reaction to guru fall downs is simply a desperate figment of imagination in order to discredit Srila Prabhupada's July 9 order, and it is nothing but a feeble attempt to give credence to the unauthorized guru system in ISKCON. In reality, the July 9 directive alone stands as the sole, unrivaled authorization of the system of Rithvik initiations in ISKCON. Hare Krishna!

**Key Quote:** "Now, the whole human civilization has become so greedy for sense gratification that all the laws of material nature are discarded."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vedic civilization's focus on spiritual advancement with the current civilization's exploitation of nature for sense gratification, leading to negative consequences.

Even though big, big cities were there in the estuaries in the Vedic times, still the whole city would be very beautiful and very pleasing to walk around. The breeze, the plants, the fruits, the trees, everything would be very pleasing. Actually, human society is supposed to live in this manner, in harmony with material nature. And in the Vedic times, the consciousness of the civilization was how to utilize this human form of life, advance in spiritual life. Whereas in the current day world, the whole consciousness of the civilization is how to exploit material nature and maximize my sense gratification. If we live according to the laws of material nature, there is ample opportunity for sense gratification, but not for unlimited, unrestricted sense enjoyment. In a limited, restricted way, in the manner it is mentioned in the Vedas, sense enjoyment is there, not that it is not there. But then, as it is said, the earth produces enough to satisfy the needs of a man, but not the greed of a man. Now, the whole human civilization has become so greedy for sense gratification that all the laws of material nature are discarded, and we try to exploit and exploit and exploit material nature. Because of what happens? Material nature also starts reacting.

**Key Quote:** "This is the love of Krishna."
**Summary:** Krishna demonstrates his love for Vidura by accepting and eating a banana peel offered with devotion, contrasting it with Duryodhana's opulent but less sincere offerings.

When Krishna came to Hastinapura, he did not go to Duryodhana's palace. Instead, he went to Vidura's house. And what did Vidura offer him? Vidura made him sit in one place. Then he brought some bananas. He did not bring any dry fruits. He did not bring badam and walnut and all. He just brought some simple bananas. He peeled the bananas, threw away the banana fruit, and gave the banana skin to Krishna. And what did Krishna do? Vidura is offering me this with so much love and affection. Because Vidura was absorbed in looking at Krishna, he forgot which is fruit, which is skin. And unknowingly, he gave the peel to Krishna. Krishna took that banana peel and ate it. Look at Krishna's love and affection. Can you or I do it? If somebody whom we love, suppose somebody has a girlfriend, loves her very much. He goes to her house. She takes a banana peel and gives it. Will you eat? But look at Krishna. He is thinking, you know, he is offering me with so much love. How can I refuse? Let me eat it. And Krishna is eating. Krishna refused the luxuries of the palace, went to the simple household of Vidura. Krishna refused the big feast that Duryodhana had kept. He took the banana peel from Vidura's hands.

So the brahmana came to the Dwaraka Palace and he condemned all the yadu Dynasty Kings, saying that in the presence of the father, how is the son dying? Because in the olden times, the king used to be responsible to ensure that there were no untimely deaths within the kingdom. People could die only of old age, out of natural causes. If any of the citizen dies in his youth when his father is still living, that means the king has become adharmic, so then the king is no longer fit to rule. So the brahmana came here and accused all the yadu Kings in front of Krishna, Balaram, Ugrasena. He told, he condemned, he criticized all of them, "What is this?

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the story of Dronacharya's Gurudakshina, where he asks the Kauravas and Pandavas to capture King Drupada, highlighting the enmity between Dronacharya and Drupada and the subsequent attack on Panchala.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to this episode of the Mahabharata. We have seen in the last episode how the Pandavas and Kauravas were growing up together in Hastinapura and the enmity which had started manifesting itself between the Kauravas and the Pandava brothers. When the Pandavas and the Kauravas were growing up under the tutelage of Dronacharya, when they had sufficiently grown up, Dronacharya asked the Pandavas and the Kauravas for a Gurudakshina. What was the Gurudakshina that he asked for? Before Dronacharya came to the Kaurava family to teach the children the art of warfare, he had a running feud with the king of Panchala Desha. He had a running feud with the king of Panchala Desha. Who was King Drippada. The eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh comprising Bareilly, Farukabad, Badayu, Kanyakubja or Kannowaj as it is known today, all these areas formed what is known as Panchala. And the capital of Panchala was Kampilya. This Kampilya is today in the place known as Kayamganj near Farooqabad. It is a small town. And even today it is known by the name Kampilya. Because of this running feud, Dronacharya as Guru Dakshina, he told the Kauravas and the Pandavas, "Please go and capture Drupada and bring him to me alive. I have a running enmity with him and I want him to be brought before me, captured. And this is the revenge I want to take against him." The Kaurava brothers went and attacked Panchaladesha. But Drupada was no ordinary king. He was also quite powerful. And he managed to repulse the attack by the Kaurava brothers, headed by Duryodhana. Now, when the Kaurava brothers came back defeated, Arjuna alone went and attacked Panchaladesha, and he defeated Drupada and brought him bound alive in front of Dronacharya.

**Key Quote:** "For a Kshatriya, the greatest humiliation is to be defeated in a battle and captured alive."
**Summary:** The lecture continues with Drupada's humiliation after being captured and released by Dronacharya, leading him to perform a Yajna to beget a son (Drishtadyumna) who would kill Dronacharya, and the birth of Draupadi.

When Arjuna attacked Panchala, he attacked a fort called Ahichatra in Panchala where Drupada was currently residing at that time. This Ahichatra is near Ramnagar in Bareilly of Uttar Pradesh. And even today, some of the remains of that fort are still seen. Then Dronacharya, when Drupada was brought before him, he spoke to Drupada and told him, "See, you had humiliated me and now you are in front of me bound like an animal. And you are at my mercy. But I am a very liberal brahmana, so I don't want to kill you. I just wanted to teach you a lesson not to humiliate other people." And he released Drupada. Drupada went back to Panchala. But then he was very much affected by the humiliation he had undergone. For a Kshatriya, the greatest humiliation is to be defeated in a battle and captured alive. For a Kshatriya, the greatest humiliation is to be defeated in a battle and captured alive and then released is a great ignominy. Drupada could not tolerate this and therefore he conducted a Yajna to beget a son who would have the ability and the power to kill Dronacharya because Drupada knew he himself was not powerful enough to fight with Dronacharya and defeat him and therefore he conducted a Yajna specifically to beget a son who would be powerful enough to kill Dronacharya and out of this Yajna were born a daughter and a son. The son was Drishtadyumna and the daughter was Draupadi. And when Draupadi emerged out of that fire sacrifice, there was a divine proclamation that this girl will in the future become the cause of destruction of many adharmic kings. And this Drishtadyumna was born with the power to be able to in the future kill Dronacharya.

### Drishtadyumna, Dronacharya, Brahmana, spirit vs matter, Bhagavad Gita

**Key Quote:** "One who is able to distinguish spirit from matter is called a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Drupada sent Drishtadyumna to Dronacharya to learn warfare, even though Drishtadyumna was destined to kill him, and then explains the qualities of a Brahmana, emphasizing the understanding of the difference between the body and the soul, referencing the Bhagavad Gita.

This Yajna which Drupada conducted in Kampilya is even today, if you go to the place called Kampilya near Farookabad, there is a pond which has been built there at the spot where this fire sacrifice was conducted. There is also a beautiful temple of Vishnu close by and this town of Kampilya is even today there in Uttar Pradesh. Now, when Drishtadyumna was growing up, Drupada thought, "I am going to kill Dronacharya. He has to send him for education under some suitable teacher who can teach him the art of warfare." And when he contemplated upon this, he realized that no one on the earth at that point of time was as capable as Dronacharya in teaching the art of warfare. And so therefore, he sent Drishtadyumna to Dronacharya to get taught in the battle of, in the art of warfare. Drishtadyumna came to Dronacharya and he approached Dronacharya submissively bowed down before him and naturally because he was a junior person, he first introduced himself to Dronacharya. Drishtadyumna introduced himself saying that "I am Drishtadyumna, the son of Drupada, born to kill you and I have come here seeking to learn the art of warfare from you." Imagine. Imagine somebody comes to you and tells you that I want to learn something from you so that I can use it to kill you. What will your response be? You will either kick him out or you will think how should I finish him now, somehow this man has come to my place, so good opportunity, let me capture him and finish him off so that he will not harm me anyway in the future. That's the natural response a person will have. But then Dronacharya was no ordinary person. He was a great Brahmana, qualified Brahmana. Not just by birth was a Brahmana but even by his qualities he was a Brahmana. The definition of the word Brahmana is brahman janatiti brahmanah. One who is able to distinguish spirit from matter is called a Brahmana. In other words, we have to understand that we are not the body, we are a spirit soul. As Lord Krishna himself says in the Bhagavad Gita, Dehino smin yatha dehe kaumaram yavanam jara, tatha dehan tara praptit dheera statra namuhyati.

### Brahmana, spirit vs matter, detachment, duty, Dronacharya, Drishtadyumna

**Key Quote:** "Although the bodies are changing, I am still constant. That means I am different from all these bodies."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the concept of a Brahmana and how Dronacharya, being a qualified Brahmana, understood his duty to impart knowledge to a qualified disciple like Drishtadyumna, despite knowing the consequences.

An intelligent person according to Krishna is able to discriminate that I was born as a small baby, I grew up into a young boy, then I become a young man and finally I will become old and I will die one day. So even within this lifetime, I have changed so many bodies. I had the body of a small baby, then that of a young boy or a girl, then that of a young man or a young girl. I may be a young person today. In the future I will become old. I may be a young person today. So within this lifetime, I am changing so many bodies. Although the bodies are changing, I am still constant. That means I am different from all these bodies. A person who is able to distinguish himself, differentiate himself from the material body which can undergo destruction and who understands by this logic that in this life if I can change so many bodies and continue to exist, that means at the time of death, the body which I currently have at that point of time will get destroyed. That means at the time of death, the body which I currently have at that point of time will get destroyed but I will continue to exist in some other body. A person who is able to understand this is called a brahmana. Now Dronacharya was a qualified brahmana. He very well knew that he was not the body. He was an atma. He was a spirit soul. Therefore when Drishtadyumna came in front of him with this kind of request, Dronacharya thought that what is my duty? My duty as a teacher is to teach the knowledge that I have. I have to teach the knowledge that I have to any qualified person who comes and seeks it of me. And this person Drishtadyumna is a qualified person. The knowledge which I will give to him, he will not misuse. He will not harm others with it. He will use it to protect the citizens. I can see that. And assessing that Drishtadyumna was a qualified disciple, Dronacharya accepted him under his tutelage. And he started teaching him the art of warfare along with the Pandavas and the Kauravas. He did not discriminate against him. This shows the great liberal mind of Dronacharya.

### Dronacharya, Arjuna, Ashwathama, Drishtadyumna, liberal mind, merit, duty

**Key Quote:** "Dronacharya went by merit and he went by what was the most appropriate thing, what duty called upon him to do."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Dronacharya's liberal-mindedness by pointing out that he chose Arjuna as the greatest archer over his own son, Ashwathama, and that he taught Drishtadyumna, focusing on merit and duty rather than personal considerations.

In fact two things are very indicative of the liberal mindedness of Dronacharya. Although Dronacharya had a son Ashwathama, he chose to make Arjuna the greatest archer in the world. He taught Arjuna which he did not teach Ashwathama. Why? Because Dronacharya went by merit. He saw that Arjuna had a certain dedication and a certain talent which Ashwathama his own son did not possess. As a beautiful father he taught Ashwathama whatever he had to teach and he gave him a little more facility at certain times also. He was a little more lenient because after all he was his son. And nobody should criticize him saying that as a father he did not do anything for his son. Therefore he was a little more lenient with his son. But still when it came to certain very critical and advanced things Dronacharya gave that those kind of advanced knowledge to Arjuna which he did not give even to Ashwathama. This shows how Dronacharya was never partial. He went by merit and he went by what was the most appropriate thing, what duty called upon him to do. The second thing was the case of Drishtadyumna where Dronacharya considered that my duty is to teach Drishtadyumna. The result is I will get killed. Now I can refuse to teach him but still one day or the other this body has to get destroyed. I have to die one day or the other. One day or the other I have to leave this body and take on another body. So if I don't do my duty also I have to give up this body and if I do my duty also I have to give up this body. It is better that I do my duty and give up this body rather than to live with the ignominy that look at Dronacharya, he did not do his duty and to live with that ignominy is worse than death. It is better that I do my duty and lose my life in the process of doing my duty. And so saying Dronacharya very liberally he taught Drishtadyumna also. And during this time it so happened that having heard about the fame of Drishtadyumna, he came to Dronacharya and requested him to teach him the art of archery. But Dronacharya saw that Ekalavya would misuse the knowledge if it was given to him. And therefore Dronacharya refused to teach Ekalavya. This is generally a misunderstood phenomenon because people think that Dronacharya refused to teach Ekalavya. Ekalavya simply based on the caste in which he was born, which is not true. Because if Dronacharya had such considerations based on the body, he would never have taught Drishtadyumna, the art of warfare. Dronacharya was far far above all these things.

**Key Quote:** "The consideration of Dronacharya was whether this knowledge will be used properly or not."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the common misconception about Dronacharya refusing to teach Ekalavya based on caste, clarifying that Dronacharya's decision was based on his assessment that Ekalavya would misuse the knowledge, illustrated by the incident with the dog.

The consideration of Dronacharya was whether this knowledge will be used properly or not. And Dronacharya's assessment proved true because later once when the Pandavas were going around in the forest, they came upon a dog whose mouth was filled with arrows. And when they saw this, they thought who has done this? And they came upon Ekalavya. And Ekalavya, he informed the Pandavas that this dog was barking. So to quieten it, I shot all these arrows into the mouth of the dog. And the Pandavas saw that Ekalavya had a bust of Dronacharya and he was learning the art of archery, still keeping Dronacharya as his guru. The Pandavas went and informed Dronacharya. Dronacharya came there and he saw what Ekalavya was doing. And he told Ekalavya that "Ekalavya I told you that I am not going to teach you the art of warfare. So why are you keeping my bust and still considering me as a guru and learning the art of archery?" This very fact showed that Ekalavya was disobedient to his guru. When Dronacharya had refused to teach him, if he had gone to some other teacher and learnt the art of warfare, it would have been different. But he refused to listen to Dronacharya. Still he kept Dronacharya as his guru and learnt. Moreover, what we can see is that Dronacharya's assessment of his future potential of Ekalavya misusing the art of warfare was seen in his silencing the dog by shooting arrows into its mouth. How to understand this? The simple question. The simple example is like for example there is an NSD commando. In the army the NSD commando are the elite commando forces and they are taught all kinds of how to use all kinds of automatic weapons. Now let us say an NSD commando, he is proficient in using the latest assault rifle, an automatic rifle and he has come home and he is relaxing. And the neighbor's dog starts barking and it disturbs him a lot. So what he does? He comes out of his house, brings his automatic rifle and pumps hundreds of bullets into the dog. What will be the result of this? The army will strip him of his NSD commandoship. They will remove him, they will suspend him from his job and they will take away the assault rifle. They will say, this assault rifle is not meant for shooting at dogs, it is meant for use in a circumstance where is there is danger to the life of the dog. But why do you do this attack the citizens?

**Key Quote:** "This assault rifle is not meant for shooting at dogs, it is meant for use in a circumstance where is there is danger to the life of the dog."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of an NSD commando misusing an assault rifle to explain Ekalavya's misuse of archery, emphasizing that Dronacharya took away Ekalavya's thumb to prevent further misuse of knowledge, not out of partiality or caste discrimination.

If the dog was disturbing you, all that you have to do was stick up a stone and throw it at it, no, you do not have to throw a stone at a dog. Even if you make a, even if you feign, as if you are going to throw a stone at the dog, the dog will quieten down or it will run away. This is natural. All of us would have experienced this at some time or the other. So similarly, when he, when Ekalavya came across a dog barking at him, all that he had to do was take a stone and throw at it. But what did he do? He decided to use that great art of archery against the dog. That poor dog became the object for Ekalavya to show off his art of archery which is not acceptable because the art of archery is a very very high level of knowledge to be utilized only for protection of people, not to harm people, whether any person, whether it is a human being or an animal. In Vedic times both human beings as well as animals were considered praja or the citizens of the country. Animals also had an equal right to be protected by the government unlike today's time. Today's time animals are sent to the slaughterhouses and all protection is given to the human beings. Vedic times was not like that. Even animals were protected by the government. Even animals were given the right of protection. So this Ekalavya did not display that sense of protecting subordinate people or junior people. A dog is a very subordinate animal. It was worthy of his protection but instead he was shooting arrows into his mouth. And he did not even consider now that all the arrows are stuck in the mouth of the dog, the poor dog how will it survive? What will it eat? So you can see from this Ekalavya was prone to misuse of the knowledge of warfare. And seeing this therefore Dronacharya did not want him to commit further crimes like this. And therefore Dronacharya told him okay you are considering me as a guru, you give me your thumb as guru Dakshina. And he took away his thumb so that the chances of his misusing the knowledge of archery would be reduced. Another thing Dronacharya could have easily done was to kill him. But Dronacharya was not so keen to kill somebody. He thought why I have to kill someone. Let me just take away his thumb. That is enough to prevent him from misusing the knowledge he has. And this was the reason for Dronacharya to do this.

**Key Quote:** "We can see in the character of Dronacharya there was no question of partiality and he never made decisions based on the consideration of the body."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Dronacharya's actions were not based on partiality or bodily considerations, and then transitions to discussing the growing enmity between the Pandavas and Kauravas, fueled by Karna and Shakuni.

Unlike the mispropaganda that is spread everywhere today that Dronacharya on the basis of caste, he decided to stop the Dronacharya. To stop the Ekalavya from becoming a good archer. Or another misconception is that Dronacharya was partial to Arjuna and therefore he did not want Ekalavya to become the topmost archer, which is not true. We can see in the character of Dronacharya there was no question of partiality and he never made decisions based on the consideration of the body. This we have seen earlier itself from the example of Drishtadyumna and Ashwathama. So now, the Pandavas, so this showed the great characteristic and quality of Dronacharya. Now, when the Pandavas and the Kauravas, they had sufficiently grown up, we have also seen how there was some amount of enmity between the Kauravas and the Pandavas. Because Karna was also almost equal to Arjuna, but Arjuna was still better than Karna in many aspects of archery. Karna also did not get along well with the Pandavas. And as we know, foe's foe is a friend. Duryodhana struck up a friendship with Karna and Karna became a steadfast friend of Duryodhana. And Duryodhana, he was being guided by Gandhari's brother Shakuni, who was not a person of good character. He was a cunning person. And he was always his, Shakuni's eyes were always on the throne, that somehow or the other, my nephew should get the throne. And Karna was also not a man of good character. And so these two people started counselling Duryodhana. And thus, they both started feeding, already Duryodhana was burning with envy towards the Pandavas. Now, these two personalities started feeding that fire of envy in Duryodhana's heart. And so Duryodhana's heart started burning. And so Duryodhana's heart turned to a fire of pan-d survives itself becoming more and more envious and inimical towards the Pandavas. Now, Duryodhana, he realized that direct confrontation with the Pandavas would not yield any result because he had seen how, against even Drupada, he had been defeated but Arjuna had single handedly defeated Drupada. This itself showed the prowess of Arjuna. Arjuna, one brother, was enough to defeat the entire Kauravas. So, this is in the same way that Duryodhana was feeling. Now they were five brothers. Look at the strength of Bhima and then there was Yudhishthira, Nakula, Sahadeva. They were also not any less warriors. Therefore Duryodhana understood that direct confrontation would not work out.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Duryodhana's plan, hatched with Shakuni, to eliminate the Pandavas by sending them to a house of shellac in Varanavata and setting it ablaze, ending with a cliffhanger to be continued in the next episode.

And so based on the advice of Shakuni, Duryodhana hatched a plan to eliminate the Pandavas. Duryodhana had a house built of shellac in a place called Varanavata. This Varanavata is in current day Haryana and today it is known as Barnava. Even today if you go to this place Barnava, the place where the house of shellac stood, the palace of shellac stood is a big mound of earth. And this is the place where the house of shellac was built by Duryodhana with a worker named Purochana. The intention of Duryodhana was that shellac is a very inflammable material. He would on some pretext send the Pandavas to stay in this house of shellac in Varanavata and his idea was to set it ablaze. And the Pandavas would die in the inferno and he could announce to the world that the Pandavas have died in a fire accident. That was the plan he hatched with Shakuni and Dhritarashtra. And with this intention he created this house of shellac and Dhritarashtra also called the Pandavas and he told them that Duryodhana has built a nice palace for all of you. So for a few days you please go there and have some leisure time, relax there and come back after a few days. Like this Dhritarashtra told the Pandavas. The Pandavas were unaware of the plotting by Duryodhana and so they thought uncle is telling us to go so let us all go. And so they along with the Pandavas along with Kunti Devi set out to go to Varanavata. Now, what happened to the Pandavas when they went to Varanavata? Could they escape from the house of Shellac? How did they, how could they escape when they had no knowledge of what was going to happen? Join us in our next session of Mahabharata to learn about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, focusing on the plot devised by Duryodhana and his allies to cheat the Pandavas out of their kingdom during the game of dice.

And welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the previous episode, we have seen the beginning of one of the key moments in the history of the world, in the history of the Mahabharata, a pivotal point in the whole narration of the Mahabharata epic, the game of dice. We saw how Duryodhana and Shakuni, Duryodhana, Shakuni, Karna, and Dhritarashtra, Dushyasana, all these people combined together to lay out a scheme, a plot, how to trap the Pandavas and take their kingdom by cheating, because the Pandavas were too powerful for direct confrontation. We also saw how Yudhishthiram had a great power over the Mahabharata. He was hard excited and eager to turn that game around. He almost stepped out when Dhritarashtra killed him. Udhishthira Maharaj was unwilling to participate in that game of dice, but he was bound by the instructions of his elder, Dhritarashtra. Even though Yudhishthira tried to wriggle out of the trap set by Duryodhana and Shakuni by refusing to play with Shakuni, Duryodhana, on the plea of playing himself, made Shakuni catch the dice on his behalf.

This distances between the two power- environments, which was actually not according to the rules of the game, but Dhritarashtra, as the referee, he did not object to it and he did not give heed to Yudhishthira's objection. So Yudhishthira was forced to go along. When the dice started rolling, the stakes initially started with small things, some jewels, some gold, etc. Each time the dice would be rolled, Sakuni would win and Yudhishthira would lose. Gradually, as the play progressed, the stakes became bigger, armies, the different kinds of weapons, servants, different soldiers, etc., etc. The stakes kept getting bigger and bigger and each

And Yudhishthira, having no other go, he put his kingdom at stake and played, and Yudhishthira lost that also. Now the whole assembly was abuzz. While all this was going on, the people who are witnessing were not very happy with the way things were proceeding. They could see that the whole game was rigged, but then Dhritarashtra, the emperor, was sitting there and he was not saying anything, and the king's word is final, so people did not know what to do.

inside. If a person keeps losing, he will think, keep thinking, maybe just one step next, next time I may be able to win back everything. So Yudhishthira also thought, now what to do? The kingdom is lost, everything is lost, they are back on the streets, the Pandavas are back on the street. So he put at stake Nakula and he lost Nakula also. Then Sahadeva, Sahadeva also lost. Then he staked Arjuna and he lost Arjuna also. Finally, he staked Bhima, very unwillingly, but with no other choice, he staked Bhima and Bhima was also lost. Now the whole assembly fell completely silent because what was happening, because everyone could see what was happening was not at all auspicious. This was going to lead to something terrible. Everybody could sense it. Then finally Yudhishthira Maharaj, seeing no other go, he stated himself and he played one last attempt, let me try one last time, maybe I will be able to win back everything. And he staked himself and the dice was rolled and again Yudhishthira Maharaj was lost. Now he was perspiring, he did not know what to do. Everything had been lost according to the scheme, according to the trap laid by Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra, Shakuni and others.

**Key Quote:** "Shakuni told him you still have one chance what is that one chance why don't you stake Draupadi she is still there that's the last thing you possess"
**Summary:** Shakuni suggests staking Draupadi, causing an uproar in the assembly. Yudhishthira stakes and loses her, leading to widespread shock and condemnation, except from Duryodhana and his allies.

Now what to do? He was completely downcast. Then Shakuni told him, you still have one chance. What is that one chance? Why don't you stake Draupadi? She is still there. That's the last thing you possess. The whole assembly was an uproar. How can Draupadi be staked? How can she, is the daughter-in-law of the Kaurava household? How can her honor be put at stake? And now Vidura could not tolerate it. He spoke very heavily against Duryodhana and told Dhritarashtra, please stop this. Don't do this. Now, what happens is when Duryodhana heard this, Duryodhana could not broke it, whatever Vidura was saying, and he started chastising him very severely, reprimanding him very severely, because it is said that, if advice is given to a foolish person for his own welfare, instead of shanta, instead of it making him peaceful, it will only anger him. An intelligent person, when he receives the advice of a foolish person, he will only anger him. When he receives good advice, he will take it very peacefully and he will dwell on it, he will contemplate on it and try to make use of that advice. But a foolish person will think, this advice is for my detrimental, it is detrimental to my interest. And when good advice is given, he will not accept it. Duryodhana was like that. Despite Vidura's so many good advice, he would never accept it. He always was under the impression that Vidura, he is, is partial towards the Pandavas and he does not think of my welfare, although in reality Vidura was talking for his own good. Duryodhana very severely reprimanded Vidura and Dhritarashtra was silent. He did not take any action. So Vidura also felt silent because he also became helpless. And so now Draupadi was put at stake. And again the dice was rolled. And like all the previous times, again Yudhishthira Maharaj lost. Now everything was gone. Nothing was left. The whole assembly

**Key Quote:** "Karna started remembering the insult that Draupadi had made upon him in the Swayambhara where in front of everyone she had said that Karna, because of being born in a Sudra family, he could not participate in the Swayambhara."
**Summary:** Karna, fueled by past resentment, instigates the humiliation of Draupadi, declaring her a slave and ordering her to be brought to the servant's quarters, recalling her rejection of him at her Swayamvara.

was completely in uproar. Nobody was happy with what was happening, except for three, four people: Dushyasana, Karna, Duryodhana, Shakuni, Dhritarashtra. These were the only people who were really happy. Nobody else was happy. Now Karna started remembering the insult that Draupadi had made upon him in the Swayambhara, where in front of everyone she had said that Karna, because of being born in a Sudra family, he could not participate in the Swayambhara. So he immediately told Duryodhana, now Draupadi is a slave. The Pandavas have lost themselves. All the Yudhishthira and Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, all the Pandavas have lost themselves. Now Duryodhana, Karna, Duryodhana, Shakuni, Dhritarashtra, Karna, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, all the Pandavas have lost themselves. They are all our slaves. And even Draupadi has been lost in the game of dice. So bring her, why she should stay in the royal household. Please bring her and let us send her to the quarters, the servant's quarters. Let her stay with all the maidservants. So our servant was sent to bring Draupadi from her inner chambers. Now Draupadi had not dressed herself yet. Generally when we, we are at home, we will be wearing some casual dress, we will not be wearing our formal dress. So Draupadi was in her casual dress, she was not planning to come out, so she was not dressed formally. So she was not in a position to come to the assembly when called for and when she heard from the messenger that like this, in the game of dice, Yudhishthira Maharaj had lost all the brothers. He had lost himself and he had lost Draupadi also and now Draupadi was told to come to the assembly so that she could be sent to the servant's quarters.

**Summary:** Draupadi questions the fairness of her being staked, and Dushyasana forcibly drags her, improperly dressed, into the assembly, disregarding her pleas and the presence of elders.

She sent the messenger back with a question asking whether she had been fairly lost in the bet, whether she had been fairly lost in the game of dice. Did Yudhishthira stake her and lose her and then he lost himself or he first staked himself and then he lost himself. He staked Draupadi later in which case the whole, his losing Draupadi becomes questionable. Now when the messenger came back and asked this question, nobody had a proper answer. So Duryodhana told Dushyasana, what is all this, you know, asking various people to bring her, you go and bring her. So Dushyasana forcibly entered into the women's quarters. Actually men are not supposed to enter the women's quarters. Enter into the women's section of the palace wherever they are staying. The men's and the women's quarters would be completely different. But he forcibly entered there, caught hold of Draupadi by her hair, by her tresses and he started dragging her to the assembly. Draupadi was, she was objecting, she was saying, I am not dressed properly, I can't come in this state. There are so many elderly people like Bhishma, Drona, Dhritarashtra, all such personalities, all such personalities. They are there. How can I come like this? But he would not listen. He just dragged her forcibly into the assembly and pulled her on the floor of the assembly.

**Summary:** The elders are horrified, but remain silent. Duryodhana and Karna continue to taunt Draupadi, declaring her a slave and suggesting she choose a new husband.

And when Bhishma saw this, when Drona saw this, when Vidura saw this, they were beside themselves with tears. Actually it was not an insult of Draupadi, it was an insult of the entire Kaurava dynasty. Duryodhana did not understand this. Dhritarashtra was not willing to listen. He was not willing to go against Duryodhana. Now who is going to stop them? Vidura is trying his best. Dhritarashtra would not listen to Vidura, nor would he listen to Bhishma, nor would he listen to Drona. He would not listen to anyone except Duryodhana. So, everybody, nobody knew what to do. Everybody was beside themselves and the assembly, big furor in the assembly. How can Draupadi be brought here? So many people were objecting. Some people were speaking in favor of Duryodhana. Some people were objecting. And when she was brought like this, then Duryodhana started telling her, now your husbands have lost you. Now you are a slave. You please go to the servants quarters and be with the maid servants. And then Karna told her, told Draupadi, Draupadi, now all your husbands, they have all lost you. They have all become our slaves. Now you pick up somebody else as your husband. These people are no more your slaves. And these people are no more your husbands.

**Summary:** Draupadi pleads for justice, questioning the validity of her being staked after Yudhishthira lost himself. Bhishma admits his confusion, unable to provide a clear answer.

Like this, such piercing words were being used. Draupadi was weeping and she was inconsolable. And she looked at Drona, she looked at Bhishma, Vidura, none of them are saying anything. Then she started talking to Dhritarashtra, oh my king, what is this? The honor of the entire Kaurava dynasty is being brought to the, in front of all the public like this? Is this the way to treat Dhritarashtra? Is this the way to treat the women folk of the Kaurava dynasty? Dhritarashtra was silent. Then she asked Dhritarashtra, please tell me, if Yudhishthira Maharaj had lost himself before staking me, then how is it right for him to stake me further and then lose me? Because he has already lost himself. He is no more in a position to stake anybody else. Now she asked Bhishma. Bhishma said, my dear daughter, I am unable to answer you because although Yudhishthira lost himself first and in one sense what you are saying is right, at the same time, no matter in what situation a man is, his wife is still his own. Just because Yudhishthira lost himself in the bed doesn't mean that he lost you also. Even after he became the slave of the Kauravas, of Duryodhana and others, he is still your husband. And so he had the right to stake you. So this is also there. At the same time, this logic is also there that Yudhishthira, having staked himself, had no more right to continue playing. So I am confused. I am not able to give a proper answer.

**Key Quote:** "At that time, one of Duryodhana's brothers, Vikarna, he stood up and he objected. He said, Draupadi, her honor is being put on the floor like this. I am not for this."
**Summary:** Vikarna objects to the treatment of Draupadi, arguing that she was unfairly staked. Karna rebukes Vikarna and suggests that Draupadi be disrobed, questioning her honor for having five husbands.

And so now there was nobody was able to say anything. At that time, one of Duryodhana's brothers, Vikarna, he stood up and he objected. He said, Draupadi, her honor is being put on the floor like this. I am not for this. He objected very strongly. And he said, according to me, Yudhishthira Maharaj, the one, the moment he had lost himself in the game of dice, the game of dice was over. There was no more question of betting and there was no more question of further staking Draupadi. So Draupadi is not lost. She cannot be brought into the ashram. She cannot be made a maid servant. I oppose this. Vikarna spoke very strongly, although he was a younger brother of Duryodhana. And when Karna saw this, he flared up and he started rebuking Vikarna like anything. And then Karna did something unthinkable. Karna told Dushyasana, Dushyasana, what is this Draupadi is going on talking so many things and she is asking for justice and all that. After all, she is a woman who has married five men. She has married five men as husband. Does any respectable woman do that? I think what you should do is disrobe her. Let her become naked. What she is talking so much about her honor and all that. Like this, Karna incited Dushyasana and Dushyasana also. He was also a wild man. Immediately, he was also waiting for an opportunity. Immediately, he caught hold of Draupadi's sari and started pulling at it.

**Key Quote:** "Immediately, he caught hold of Draupadi's sari and started pulling at it."
**Summary:** Dushyasana begins to disrobe Draupadi. Bhima is filled with fury but restrained by Yudhishthira's adherence to dharma. Draupadi, seeing no help from her husbands or the assembly, remembers Lord Krishna.

Now Bhima, he was waiting. He was beside himself with fury. He could not control himself. But then what to do? He was bound by his elder brother's words. And his elder brother, because he is so much fixed in virtuosity and dharma that he is not going to go against his word. He had already given his word. He had lost himself and his brothers. So he was not in a position to say anything against what Duryodhana and others were saying because they were now their slaves. So Yudhishthira Maharaj could not say anything. He could not do anything. And Bhima was bound by his words. And Arjuna started pacifying Bhima. Calm down. Calm down. Don't become too angry now. Now is not the right time. Our hands are tied. So like this, Arjuna was constantly pacifying Bhima. And so now, the brothers were not able to do anything. And in the whole assembly, Dushyasana started trying to pacify Bhima. She started trying to strip Draupadi by pulling at her saree. And Draupadi, she is trying to protect herself. She is trying to protect her honor. She is holding on with great effort to her, with great strength to her saree. But this man, Dushyasana is such a well-built, powerful guy. And Draupadi is such a delicate woman. She is a delicate princess. What she will fight against this, this bulky, hefty man full of muscles and full of strength. So she tried her best to hold the saree but she was not able to. And she saw that her husbands are not in a position to help her. She saw that the entire assembly, nobody is speaking against this injustice. So what to do now? Then she remembered one person who is the refuge of all people who are completely shelterless.

**Summary:** Draupadi, realizing her helplessness, surrenders completely to Lord Krishna, who is present within her heart as Paramatma, remembering his promise to protect her.

That is the Supreme Personality of God and Lord Krishna. So she started calling out to Krishna. Krishna! Krishna! She started calling out. But then this Dushyasana is not giving up. She is holding on. She is calling out to Krishna but nothing is happening. Then finally she realized, I am holding on to this saree with all my effort, but ultimately I cannot protect myself. In this assembly when such big, big people are there, my husbands are such great heroes, such great warriors, they are not able to protect me. What? I will protect myself. My only shelter is Lord Krishna. So she let go of her saree. She raised her hands and started calling out, O Govinda! O Gopijanavallada! O Hari Murari! Like that she started calling out to Krishna. The moment she started calling out to Krishna, Krishna, although you are so far away in Dwaraka, but then Krishna, as he says in the Bhagavad Gita, Sarvasya Chaham Hrithi Sannivishtaha, Krishna is seated in every living entity's heart as Paramatma. So the moment she gave up everything else, her dependence on her husbands, her dependence on her own abilities, she gave up everything and totally surrendered to Krishna. Krishna as Paramatma immediately sensed that surrender and although Krishna was not there, Krishna was seated in Dwaraka. He knew everything of what was happening. And then he remembered his promise to Draupadi for the service that she had rendered to him.

**Summary:** Dushyasana's attempts to disrobe Draupadi are miraculously thwarted as her sari becomes endless, leading to his exhaustion and the assembly's recognition of Krishna's intervention.

And Krishna decided now is the time to repay the debt to Draupadi. And so what happened? After that, Dushyasana pulled and pulled and pulled at her saree. The saree just kept coming and coming and the yards and the yards of cloth is being piled up on the floor. The cloth is piling on. Minute after minute, hour after hour he is pulling. Only the cloth is piling up but Draupadi is not getting disrobed. And pulling, pulling, pulling, finally what happened? Dushyasana lost all his strength and his stamina came to an end and he sat down on the floor perspiring in the midst of all the cloth. He was not able to understand what is happening, from where all this cloth is coming. And the whole assembly erupted in an uproar when they saw this wonderful miracle that was happening. Everybody understood how Krishna had saved the honour of Draupadi. So now the Vidura and Bhishma, they were all, they understood that somehow by Krishna's mercy this has happened and now Krishna is not going to keep quiet. So they became even more alarmed and they started advising Dhritarashtra at least now please stop all these injustices that's happening. How can the Kaurava assembly be sullied by trying to outrage the modesty of a woman? That too not an ordinary woman. She is one of the women folk of our own dynasty. How can this happen? How can you allow this to happen?

**Summary:** Bhima, enraged by Dushyasana's actions, vows to tear open his chest and drink his blood. Duryodhana mocks Draupadi, further fueling Bhima's anger.

Their fervent pleas were falling on deaf ears. Dhritarashtra had not only become blind, he had become deaf also. Now when Dushyasana failed in disrobing Draupadi and when Duryodhana saw all this and the Pandavas were so angry, Bhima, now he was not able to check his anger and Bhima when he saw how Dushyasana had tried to outrage the modesty of Draupadi, he looked at Dushyasana and he took a vow, a terrible vow, a vow which swore a vow so terrible, nobody had heard of such a vow before. He said in a raised voice, his eyes red with fury, Bhima said, listen everyone, I take a vow before everyone. In battle, I will tear open the chest of Dushyasana and I will drink his blood. When the assembly heard this, Bhishma, Drona, they were all struck with fear. But Duryodhana, like a fool, like a fly which foolishly it rushes into a blazing fire, oblivious of the fact that the flame is going to consume it, Duryodhana was laughing. And then he exposed this right thigh and slapping his thigh, Duryodhana told Draupadi, come, come, my dear woman, come and sit on my thigh. Now Bhima, already he was curious when he saw this, his rock completely exceeded all limits. Then he said, I am taking one more vow. In battle, I will break that thigh of yours and I will teach you a lesson.

### Draupadi's disrobing, Yudhisthira's dilemma, Duty vs. Power
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/nFxsWxV9uTc?t=96
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So does that not free the Pandavas from their binding to their words?"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the events of Draupadi's attempted disrobing and questions why Yudhisthira and the Pandavas did not intervene, exploring the conflict between their duty as servants and their duty to protect their wife.

Hare Krishna and welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode, we have seen that very painful incident of the game of dice, where Draupadi was attempted to be stripped naked by the Kauravas, headed by Karna, Duryodhana, Dushyasana, and others. And although Dushyasana tried his best to disrobe Draupadi, Draupadi surrendered herself completely to Lord Krishna, and Krishna in turn protected her modesty. And so, Dushyasana pulled and pulled at her Sari with great anticipation, but that anticipation turned to amazement when he saw an endless supply of her Sari covered cloth, and that amazement turned into frustration, that frustration became despair. Finally, he sat down fatigued, unable to disrobe Draupadi. Now, when the incidents had gone this far, Dhritarashtra had a change of heart. What did Dhritarashtra do? That is what we will be discussing today. Before we come to that, we need to understand a little bit about the whole egregious happenings in that game of dice. We all have understood how Yudhishtira was compelled to participate in the game of dice, not because he was inclined to it, but because it was the order of his superior, Dhritarashtra, whom he considered as good as his father. Now, although Yudhishtira knew that this was a trap laid out to hurt him and his brothers, Yudhishtira could not help it. He was looking towards Dhritarashtra's intervention to correct the injustice that was happening during the game of dice, but Dhritarashtra was silent all through. Now the question comes that when Draupadi was brought into that assembly and when her honor was being sullied by the Kauravas, why did Yudhishtira and the other Pandava brothers not act? Was it not their duty to protect the honour of their wife? Yes, it was their duty to the extent that their powers authorized them to protect her. We all have our limitations. Even though we may be wanting to protect our near and dear ones, there are some things which are beyond our power and we are unable to help them at times. This happens with all of us. Now in the case of the Pandavas, although physically they might have been capable of protecting her, morally they were bound by the word they had given to the Kauravas that they were now their servants. And as servants, it was their duty to do the bidding of their masters. So what use are such masters who do not protect the honour of their servants? So does that not free the Pandavas from their binding to their words?

### Kshatriya Dharma, Duty of a King, Duryodhana's Adharma
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/nFxsWxV9uTc?t=322

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Now it was Duryodhana's duty as a king to protect the honor of the Pandavas, who are now also his citizens."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Pandavas, having lost their kingdom, were no longer obligated to protect others; instead, it became Duryodhana's duty as king to protect them, including Draupadi, and that Duryodhana failed in his dharma.

So does that not free the Pandavas from their binding to their words? The fact is, that the Pandavas having lost all their kingdom and having been stripped of their Kshatriya position, having become servants of Duryodhana, no more were they in a position to be able to provide protection to others. Protecting others, protecting the citizens is the duty of the Kshatriya. Kshata trayate yati kshatriya. The Kshatriya is the person who protects his citizens from any kind of danger. It is the Kshatriya king's responsibility to give protection to all his citizens. Now that the Pandavas were no longer kings, they were mere servants, they were mere ordinary citizens, under the rule of Duryodhana. Now it was Duryodhana's duty as a king to protect the honor of the Pandavas, who are now also his citizens. Now if Duryodhana is not following his duty, if he is deviating, if he is flagrantly flouting the codes of Dharma, according to which he has to protect the honor of his citizens and prevent any kind of danger, then he is a king. Any harm to them, whether physically or economically or in terms of their honor, if Duryodhana, the king himself is flouting these duties, then what can the citizen do? So the Pandavas, in fact it was the duty of Duryodhana to protect Draupadi. He was not keeping up his duty. It was the duty of Dhritarashtra to ensure that there was no injustice to the Pandavas and even he violated his duty. Now because Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra and Karna and Dushyasana, all these people they flouted their dharma, their duty does not mean that the Pandavas also should forget their duty. Actually this was the biggest difference between Yudhishthira and the other Pandava brothers and Duryodhana.

### Duryodhana's focus on the end, Pandavas' adherence to Dharma, Virtue in Calamity

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Duryodhana's willingness to violate dharma to achieve his desires with the Pandavas' commitment to upholding dharma even in the face of great suffering.

On the one hand, Duryodhana was ready to violate every rule of dharma at the drop of a hat. Why? Because his whole consideration was, his whole focus was the end. What I will get? What I want to get? How do I satisfy my desire? The means did not matter to him. He was ready to achieve his desire by hook or by crook. It did not matter to him. It did not matter to him that he was violating the codes of dharma. It did not matter to him that he was violating the rules of the Vedas. It did not matter to him that he was incurring grievous sin because of which he would have to suffer in the future. None of these things mattered to him. For him, all that mattered was, somehow I have to get Indraprastha in my hand. Somehow I have to insult the Pandavas. Somehow I have to insult Draupadi. This was his whole focus. Now if you look at the Pandavas, the Pandavas were reluctant to violate the codes of dharma, words of virtuousness, even in the face of the greatest calamity. Even when Draupadi the wife's honor was put at stake, even there the Pandavas' consideration was, as per the codes of Dharma, what is our duty now? What are the steps that we can take? Or what are the things we should not be doing?

### Duty and Responsibility, Vishwamitra and Dasaratha, Vedic Social Structure

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is the duty of the king."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the story of Vishwamitra Muni and Dasaratha Maharaj to illustrate the Vedic concept of assigned duties and responsibilities within society, where the king is responsible for protecting those engaged in spiritual activities.

So Uddistira Maharaj, from the Pandava's consideration. If we look at it from there, from that perspective, the duty was resting with Duryodhana and with Dhritarashtra to protect Draupadi's honor because she is also their citizen. They had been deprived of their authority to perform that function of protecting others the moment they were shown of their kingdom and they were converted into ordinary servants. We have examples of this in the Vedic history. Even though a person may be very well capable of defending himself, still in Vedic times the people would consider, is it my duty to defend myself or is it somebody else's duty. When Vishwamitra Muni was performing tapasya's and yajnas in the temple, he was not only in the forest, there was a demoness who was coming and creating trouble for him, not allowing him to carry out his spiritual duty. Vishwamitra Muni is such a powerful sage. Not only that, before Vishwamitra Muni became the sage, he had been a king, a very powerful valiant king. So, it is not that he was unaware of the techniques of combat, how to fight, where to fight, with an asura, with a demoness. It was not unknown to him. Not only that, as a sage, he had powerful mantras by the dint of his austerities with which he could have easily killed the demoness. But he did not do so. He considered, my duty as a sage, what is my duty? My duty is to engage in spiritual activities. Whose duty is it to ensure that my spiritual duty is fulfilled? That is his duty. His duties are carried on without any obstruction. It is the duty of the king. And therefore, Vishwamitra Muni went to Dasaratha Maharaj, who was ruling the kingdom at that time and he informed him, like this, there is this demoness who is creating trouble for me. So, you have to please solve my problem. And Dasaratha Maharaj immediately said, yes, I am ready. I will come myself. You are such a great sage. It is a shame that if I am not able to protect you, I will come myself. And then Vishwamitra Muni said, no, no, you don't have to come. This is not such a big thing. Then Dasaratha Maharaj asked him, then whom should I send? Vishwamitra Muni said, send your two young sons, Sri Ramachandra and Lakshmana with me, who were at that time just teenagers. Dasaratha Maharaj balked. He was daunted. Why? My sons? They are so tender. They are just teenagers. They cannot fight with Asuras. So, Vishwamitra Muni, please, you don't ask for them, I will come myself. Out of parental affection, Dasaratha Maharaj did not recognize the great valor and capability and strength, the unlimited strength of the Supreme Lord Ramachandra.

### Ramachandra's Valor, Varnasrama Dharma, Duty vs. Occupation

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Vishwamitra and Dasaratha, highlighting Ramachandra's valor, and then laments the collapse of the Varnasrama Dharma in modern society, emphasizing the distinction between one's duty (dharma) and one's occupation (vritti).

For him, Ramachandra and Lakshmana were just his tender sons. Out of parental affection, he did not. He was taken aback by Vishwamitra Muni's suggestion, but Vishwamitra Muni knows everything and he is aware that this is also an idea of Lord Ramachandra and so therefore, he insisted and took Lord Ramachandra with him and he taught Ramachandra all the art of warfare and then Lord Ramachandra used that art in defeating the demoness. So, you see how Vishwamitra Muni, although he knew the art of warfare, he did not engage in the war himself, the demons. He engaged the Kshatriyas, the king of that area, who was responsible, who was interested with that responsibility. This is because during those times, in the Vedic tradition and the Sanatana Dharma, the duties of different persons in the social functioning of the society was very well laid out. In today's world, unfortunately, that societal structure has completely collapsed of the Varnasthama Dharma. Now we do not have an understanding of what is duty at all. We think we mistake our vritti, our occupation to be Dharma, to be Karma, which is not correct. There is a big difference between vritti and Dharma. There is a big difference between occupation for one's livelihood and one's duty. We have duties towards all other rest of the society. We have duties towards our parents, we have duties towards our forefathers, we have duties towards the sages, who have given us transcendental knowledge, we have duties towards devatas, who are supplying us all kinds of natural facilities, such as sunlight and air and water etc. For our livelihood, we have duties towards all other domestic, even to domestic, animals like the cow and the dog etc which render us service. We have responsibilities, we have duties, we have obligations towards our other relatives, it may be my husband, it may be my wife, it may be my sister, my other relatives, my friends, whoever helps me in various activities, I have obligations towards all of them. There are duties prescribed in the Vedas for all this. So duty is completely different from occupation for one's livelihood. One may give up one occupation and take on another occupation, but one cannot give up one's duty. And as Lord Krishna himself says in the Bhagavad-Gita, one must not give up one's duty however imperfectly performed to take up the duty of some other person however perfectly they may be able to do it.

### Importance of Duty, Dharma vs. Result, Pandavas' Example

**Key Quote:** "One must not give up one's duty however imperfectly performed to take up the duty of some other person however perfectly they may be able to do it"
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad-gita to reinforce the importance of adhering to one's own duty, even if imperfectly performed, and contrasts this with Duryodhana's focus solely on the outcome, while the Pandavas prioritized the means (dharma) over the end result.

This is against the laws of the scripture. I may be able to do my duty say with 50% efficiency, but I look at somebody else's assigned duty, I can do that much better, so let me do that. No, even though you are assigned the duty you are able to do imperfectly, it is better than doing some other person's duty which is not assigned to you very perfectly. This is the code of dharma and so the Pandavas always even in that calamitous situation were considering what is virtuosity dictating to me what should I do and what should not I, what should I not do? Is this my duty to protect Draupadi or is it not? It is the duty of actually the emperor, the king, Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana were responsible for her protection and if they are not performing their duty does not mean that I should violate my duty, I should give up my duty. This is a very big difference between Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra and the Kauravas when compared with the Pandavas. Duryodhana never had such consideration. He never thought what should I do and what should I not do? Is my activity according to dharma or not? He was simply focused on the result, somehow I have to get the result, the means don't matter, the only the end matters, whereas for the Pandavas the end did not matter, no matter how they were insulted, whether they lost their kingdom, whether they lost the honor of their wife, whatever it was, they would not deviate from the means, the end was immaterial to

### Yudhisthira's Guidance, Dharma Raja, Draupadi's Faith

**Key Quote:** "Everybody knew in that assembly that Yudhishthira Maharaj was Dharma Raja he would never deviate from the path of dharma"
**Summary:** The speaker explains why Bhima and Arjuna followed Yudhisthira's lead, emphasizing Yudhisthira's reputation as Dharma Raja and Draupadi's unwavering faith in his adherence to dharma, even amidst her suffering.

Bhima and Arjuna to come to follow Yudhishthira's this one. He has given his word. Why could not Bhima or Arjuna jump in and then protect Draupadi? Was following the instructions of their brother more important than protecting the honor of Draupadi? The fact is that Draupadi is also the wife of Yudhishthira, so there is the responsibility equal. Now as far as the Vedic culture was concerned, the eldest person had the responsibility of guiding the younger people on the path of dharma. The younger people always looked up to the elder people for guidance. So everybody knew in that assembly that Yudhishthira Maharaj was Dharma Raja. He would never deviate from the path of dharma. His brothers also knew that and nobody knew the intricacies of dharma better than Yudhishthira and so therefore the younger brothers, Bhima, Arjuna, and others, even though they could see such a difference between dharma and Yudhishthira, injustice being meted out in that assembly, they held on to their firm faith in their brother Yudhishthira Maharaj that he knows the codes of dharma very well and he will tell us what is the real dharmic duty that they had to perform at that point of time. So even Bhima and Arjuna were also very clear in their mind, we have to do what is our ordained duty. We cannot, we cannot flout the requirements of our duty. We cannot violate the laws of dharma. So therefore the Pandavas are the most, are the most pious people, they are the most praiseworthy people. In fact, when the game of dice ended in this kind of fiasco, even though the Yudhishthira Maharaj lost in that game of dice, even though Draupadi was about to be disrobed, but Lord Krishna had to step in to save her, the fact is even Draupadi had no resentment in her heart towards Yudhishthira Maharaj. She had full confidence that whatever Yudhishthira Maharaj has done was within the codes of dharma. He could clearly understand that even Bhima and Arjuna were bound by the ropes of dharma of virtuosity and so therefore she had no resentment in her heart because she was also inclined and she felt that she was totally inquisitive. She was also equally disposed to follow the course of Dharma rather than look at what was the result that had accrued out of that following of that Dharma. She had no resentment in her heart that she, Yudhishthira Maharaj and Arjuna and Bhima, they followed the path of Dharma and they ditched me. There was no such resentment in Draupadi's heart. On the other hand, she was completely proud of her husband that even in that position, they followed the path of Dharma.

### Dhritarashtra's Dual Personality, Duryodhana's Greed, Dhritarashtra's Regret

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra also, Dhritarashtra realized that."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Dhritarashtra's internal conflict, his love for both the Pandavas and Duryodhana, and his regret at allowing the events to escalate to the point of Draupadi's attempted disrobing, highlighting Duryodhana's greed and lustful desires.

So finally, Dhritarashtra, when he saw that things had gone too far, maybe Dhritarashtra's whole thing was, as we have seen, his dual personality. He had love for the Pandavas, he had love for his younger brother, as well as he had too much love for Duryodhana and the throne. And that love for Duryodhana and the throne overwhelmed his love for the Pandavas. So maybe Dhritarashtra had no intention to insult the Pandavas like that. His intention would have been to just get the kingdom and be happy with that. Although actually even Indraprastha was not his. Hastinapura itself, the throne of Hastinapura which he and Duryodhana were occupying, that did not belong to them. That was actually, you can look at it, because of the magnanimity of the Pandavas. They were able to occupy that throne. Otherwise, the Pandavas were the rightful heirs to that throne, not Duryodhana, not Dhritarashtra. But look at the greed of Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra when the Pandavas, from scratch, they built up their own kingdom. They wanted to go and occupy that. They were committing that. So Dhritarashtra's eye was on the opulence of Indraprastha. But even he didn't want to go and occupy that. He had not expected that it would go to the extent of trying to disrobe Draupadi. That was too much. Dhritarashtra also realized that. But by that time, before he could step in, already the act had happened. Everything was happening very swiftly. You see, now we are looking at that whole event in hindsight. But when they were in that, in that whole assembly, when everything was going on, people sometimes have brain fakes. You know, that's a common terminology we use nowadays. Some people have brain fakes. Sometimes some people, even though they have full understanding and the knowledge to be able to act properly in a situation, sometimes people, out of some brain fade at that point of time, they do something which is contrary to what should be done. That was, similar thing could have happened with Dhritarashtra also, because of which he did not step in at the right time. But when it had gone to this extent, and when he saw Bhima taking vow after terrible vow, that was the end. That was the end. That shook Dhritarashtra out of his slumber, weak slumber that he was in and he realized things had gone too far and he understood that this was something which he had not bargained for. Whereas, you see, in the case of Duryodhana, he wanted, he coveted their kingdom also and he also wanted to insult the Pandavas and he wanted to satisfy his lusty desire towards Draupadi. He got that opportunity and he tried to make, take full advantage of that. So, Dhritarashtra knew about Duryodhana's love for the throne, but he did not know about his lusty desires towards Draupadi. If he had known earlier, probably he would have taken steps to prevent this.

### Dhritarashtra's Conciliation, Inevitable War, Pandavas' Dishonor

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra woke up and then he immediately put a stop to everything."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Dhritarashtra's attempt to rectify the situation by returning the Pandavas' kingdom and seeking forgiveness, while acknowledging the inevitability of future conflict and emphasizing that the shame rested on the Kauravas, not the Pandavas.

Dhritarashtra woke up and then he immediately put a stop to everything. And what did Dhritarashtra do? He, in order to pacify the Pandavas, he returned everything that the Pandavas had lost. He returned the kingdom to Yudhishthira Maharaj and then he begged them to forgive Duryodhana and others for whatever had happened and he told them, let us forget and forgive. Although at heart, Dhritarashtra also knew that this is not something which the Pandavas are going to forget, nor is Bhima going to forget as well. This is going to create a big war in the future and all my sons are going to be in great peril. Dhritarashtra knew this, but still he was trying to use conciliatory word to try to, as far as possible to postpone the inevitable. That was Dhritarashtra's mode. And then Dhritarashtra, he said. He was a great man. He was a great man. In front of, publicly in front of everyone he announced that Yudhishthira, he actually he commended the Pandavas, he commended Yudhishthira Maharaj for standing by virtuosity, by standing by Dharma even in such great distress and having trying to and he used many conciliatory words and tried to console Draupadi also and then finally he dissolved the assembly and asked everyone to go back to their respective places. So the Pandavas accompanied by Draupadi with a very heavy heart they took their belongings, mounted on their chariots and started back to Indraprastha, their minds completely disturbed and their hearts heavy with the insult that they had faced, with the dishonor that they had suffered from the Pandavas and they tried to console Draupadi with the insult that they had suffered from the Pandavas and they tried to console Draupadi. However, we have to understand that when a person gets insulted on account of some mistake he has done, it is a cause for great pain, but the Pandavas underwent such great dishonor not for any fault of theirs, so there was no shame on their part. The shame entirely rested on Duryodhana, Karna, Dushyasana and all the Dhritarastha and all these people. So now when the assembly was dissolved, they were all in a state of great pain and they resolved. Everybody left to their respective residences and slowly the hall petered out and it became empty. The Pandavas left for Indraprastha, Bhishma went back to his quarters, Vidura went back to his palace, Dhritarastha went back to his room and the entire hall, all the people who had assembled slowly they all left the assembly hall. Gradually the assembly hall became empty except for a few people. Who are these people and what were they waiting in that hall for? Join us in our next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna. Jagat Guru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai! Netai Gor Premanande Hari Hari Bol!

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode and sets up the current one, focusing on the reactions of Duryodhana and his allies after Dhritarashtra reverses his decision and returns the Pandavas' possessions.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the previous episode we have seen how after the game of dice, good sense prevailed over Dhritarashtra and he returned all those things which had been wrongfully, by way of cheating, had been taken away from the Pandavas by Shakuni and Duryodhana. After the game of dice, after Dhritarashtra returned everything and he spoke a few conciliatory words to Draupadi and to the Pandavas, he dissolved the assembly and everyone left the assembly hall. After everyone left the assembly hall, a few people remained back and they were looking at each other and who are these people and what were their thoughts. Stay with us today to learn about that. The Pandavas after leaving the assembly, they stepped out of the place and they got onto their chariots and they left Hastinapura. They drove back to Indraprastha. Their hearts were heavy. Their thoughts were filled with all those words of insults and the attempt to disrobe Draupadi. The wounds were still fresh in their hearts and the Pandavas were still festering. The Pandavas, although at that moment, at that point of time, there was no way they could vent out their anger and frustration, carrying these heavy thoughts in their mind, they were going back to Indraprastha. After they had gone out of Hastinapura and they had travelled some distance, they were told that somebody was coming on a horseback trying to catch up with them. Soon the person who was on horseback caught up with the Pandavas and they saw that this person on horseback was one of the servants from the Hastinapura palace. This servant, he came with a message to Yudhishthira Maharaj and to the Pandavas. He said, Yudhishthira Maharaj. The Pandavas were surprised. They, after all that had happened, they just left the assembly and they had set out back to Indraprastha. But suddenly this messenger turned up and this messenger said that he was carrying a message for the Pandavas from Dhritarashtra. What was this message that Dhritarashtra had chosen to send to the Pandavas? Actually what had happened? After the game of dice and the Pandavas were returned their kingdom and whatever they had lost at the stakes and that they had left the hall and all the others who are present in the assembly had all left, Dhritarashtra had left, Bhishma had left, Drona had left and all the other people whoever were present in that assembly, they had all left. Now after everyone had left, Duryodhana, Karna, Shakuni and Dushasana were left and they were looking at each other because for them it was a great shock. For all of them, they had almost won everything but at the last moment Dhritarashtra's decision had turned the tables, so they were still in shock of what had happened. Finally Dushasana spoke up, that old man has gone senile, we had the Pandavas and their kingdom in our grip and he left it off just like that. Buddha satya gaya hai jo hamare haath mein aaya tha nikal gaya moose nivala nikal gaya kai ketna du vaai ketala hai anda kelavan yedukuthaan ipdi pannano a kelavan ayalak endu iti wap affah diyauta just jangal kaiyila vannadana ellan na sipitu kai bantit baayi kukki barili la muduka aapet illa halaput lie mandit kai k bandit baayi qaratu upmunche muduka illa halpa puta

**Key Quote:** "Somehow Hastinapura was not ours. We have got it in our hand. Now if we get into a battle with the Pandavas and lose Hastinapura also in our greed for Indraprastha, then we are left with, we are neither here nor there."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Duryodhana's fear of direct confrontation with the Pandavas and Shakuni's plan to manipulate them into another game of dice.

So these were the feelings of Dushasana. Duryodhana also felt alike but there was nothing they could do, what to do. But if the matter had been just that, that the Pandavas had been returned their kingdom, it would not have been much of an issue. But the issue was that the Pandavas had been subjected to such great insults that they were not going to keep quiet. On some pretext or the other, Duryodhana was afraid they would take a war with the Kauravas. Then it would be very difficult because Duryodhana very well knew the prowess of the Pandavas. All along until now, he had been trying to avoid direct confrontation but to somehow through some cunning means, somehow cheat them of their kingdom and cheat them of their royal authority. These were his plans. So all along he had always avoided direct confrontation because Duryodhana knew that if he were to directly face the Pandavas in battle, he would not be able to succeed. Chakuni then spoke up and he told Duryodhana whatever happened, happened. Now you see, we cannot directly engage in a battle with the Pandavas. We cannot afford that. Somehow Hastinapura was not ours. We have got it in our hand. Now if we get into a battle with the Pandavas and lose Hastinapura also in our greed for Indraprastha, then we are left with, we are neither here nor there. So we have to think of something

**Summary:** The speaker details Shakuni's plan for another game of dice and Duryodhana's efforts to convince Dhritarashtra, emphasizing the desire to preempt a potential war by sending the Pandavas into exile.

immediately. Then Chakuni said, I have got a plan by which we can still save the situation. What is that? Chakuni said, somehow if we convince the Pandavas again for another game of dice, then somehow we can manage to win back whatever we want. Now neither Karna nor Duryodhana nor Dushyasana were in favor of a direct fight with the Pandavas because everybody knew they could not win. What Chakuni was proposing seemed to be the only solution. But then how to do it? How could the Pandavas again be brought back to another game of dice? Duryodhana took the task upon himself and went and met Dhritarashtra. He spoke to his father and he tried various ways to convince Dhritarashtra. Dhritarashtra was like, no, no, why? He was not in favor of it. He said, already one game of dice, so much bad blood has happened between the two of you. One more game of dice, there will be no stopping the, stopping a war between the two of you. So Dhritarashtra was not in favor. Finally Duryodhana told Dhritarashtra, my dear father, Dhritarashtra has gone out of control. Sooner or later the Pandavas will gather some, on some pretext or the other, they will gather an army and attack us. We have to preempt this. So the only preemptive fight that we can do is, you have to call them for another game of dice and we have to ensure that we win back the kingdom. Now, if we don't do that, we have to call them for another game of dice. If we don't do that, then what are we doing? We are inviting trouble. Because it is, the Pandavas are now like snakes who have been trampled upon. Once we trample upon a snake's head, after that you cannot think of just walking away silently. The snake will follow you and it will attack you and it will try to bite you. The only way is, you have to defend yourself. If you have to take protective measures. Duryodhana, hence, told Dhritarashtra that the only way to take a preemptive action is to prevent a battle from happening, which can only be done if the Pandavas are somehow sent out away from Indraprastha and we have to send them in exile somewhere. And for that, the only way is to engage them again in another game of dice. Not only this, Duryodhana told Dhritarashtra, let us engage them in a game of dice and let's take this time. Duryodhana told Dhritarashtra that the only way is to engage them again in another game of dice and let's take this time. And for that, the only way is to engage them again in another game of dice and let's take this time. And if the Pandavas are in exile for a sufficient period of time, Duryodhana said, with all the wealth in Indraprastha and with all the kings, I will get all the kings on my side and then my power will become really strong and the Pandavas, whenever they come back, they will not be able to face us. They will not be able to withstand the power of my army.

### Gandhari's advice, righteousness, evil, fate

**Key Quote:** "please hand over the kingdom to the Pandavas and banish Duryodhana from the family."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Gandhari's opposition to the game of dice and her advice to Dhritarashtra to favor the Pandavas, highlighting the conflict between righteousness and familial attachment.

Dhritarashtra, although he was hesitant, finally, Duryodhana's persuasive words finally overcame his hesitancy. So finally, Dhritarashtra agreed. And Dhritarashtra summoned the servant and sent him, dispatched him to order Yudhishthira for another game of dice. When Dhritarashtra took this decision and this decision came to be that the message started spreading everywhere that Dhritarashtra has again called for one more game of dice, the news reached Gandhari's ears. She came running to her husband and she said, I heard that you have called for one more game of dice. I have heard what Draupadi had to go through in that assembly. It is unthinkable how Draupadi could have been subjected to such ignominy. And somehow you salvage the situation by returning everything. Now you have gone round the bend. You are again calling for another game of dice. Really, I mean, what do you think of yourself? Do you understand the consequences of your action? This is absolutely, what you are doing is absolutely wrong. On the other hand, Gandhari, the mother of Duryodhana, she advised Dhritarasva. On the other hand, please hand over the kingdom to the Pandavas and banish Duryodhana from the family. You send him away from Hastinapura. Don't keep him here. This was a mother's advice to Dhritarasva. Duryodhana's own mother, she could see the evilness in Duryodhana and the righteousness of the Pandavas and she was fully in favour of the Pandavas and she said better to reject Duryodhana and avoid any sort of ill-will and fighting within the family. But Dhritarasva, what was Dhritarasva's response? He told Gandhari, you see Gandhari, whatever I have to do, I have done. Now, whatever happens, by the will of providence, let it happen. I cannot help it. And he walked off. Now, Gandhari, what could she do? She had tried her best. She went back.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Yudhishthira's acceptance of the invitation to another game of dice, emphasizing the Kshatriya's duty to uphold dharma and honor the commands of elders, even at personal cost.

And finally, this messenger, despatched by Dhritarasva, had now reached the Pandavas and he was standing in front of Yudhishthira with the message from Dhritarasva. What was the message? The message was, the king is calling you, Yudhishthira Maharaja. For another game of dice. Yudhishthira looked at his brothers and he said, I am helpless. It is the duty of a Kshatriya never to say no to a challenge. Over and above this, Dhritarasva is in the position of my father. He is my elder. He is ordering, I cannot disobey him. The other brothers in Draupadi, they also understood and fully well they empathized with Yudhishthira Maharaja's position. And they could understand that there was hardly anything else they could do in the face of following the rules of Dharma. Actually, what we have to understand is, there are rules of Dharma for protecting oneself. And then there are higher rules. There are secondary principles and there are higher principles. At a very individual level, if I am very selfish, I take care of myself. Now, I am not living alone in this society. I am living in the midst of so many relatives, friends, servants, so many people are serving me, so many animals. And there are so many demigods, devatas who are providing me so much facilities and conveniences in nature. So, I am living in the midst of all of these things. So, I have duty towards my own, taking care of my own welfare. Then, I also have to think about higher principles. Welfare of my family. Then, welfare of my friends and relatives. Welfare of the entire humankind. Welfare of other animals. Welfare of this earth. Welfare of this environment. We have responsibility towards all these things. At an individual level, if you see, the Pandavas knew that this game of dice is not going to augur well for them. It will bring about their own downfall. But then, as Kshatriyas, they had to rise above the principles of taking care of one's own welfare. As Kshatriyas, they had higher principles to follow. So, since they were Kshatriyas, since they were rulers, those principles took precedence over their personal welfare. So, Yudhisthira could not refuse Dhritarashtra's order and he came back

for the second game of dice. Now, when the second game of dice started, again, it was the same assembly. The Dhritarashtra was sitting at the head of the assembly surrounded by Bhishma, Drona, Vidura and opposite Yudhisthira Maharaj to play the game of dice was Duryodhana and on his behalf as usual, it was Shakuni casting the dice. The entire assembly was very unhappy. Everyone was censuring Dhritarashtra that why is he doing this? But then, Dhritarashtra was completely under the control, under the sway of his greedy son and he could not help it. Although he knew at his heart that what he was doing was completely wrong. Now, in the second game of dice, Shakuni spoke to Yudhisthira Maharaj and in the being audible to the entire audience, Shakuni put the conditions of the game. Shakuni informed Yudhisthira Maharaj and the rest of the assembly, whatever we played, we played and somehow we won, you lost, let us forget all those things. Now, it is a new game of dice and here the stakes are much higher. If Duryodhana and I lose in this game of dice, then we all Kauravas will leave our kingdom and we will live in the forest in exile for 12 years. And in the 13th year, we will live in some city or village or town, incognito, in disguise, such that nobody can recognize us. And if the 13th year we are able to pass successfully without your detecting us, where we are and who we are, then in the 14th year, you will return the kingdom to us. Suppose, in the 13th year of exile, you recognize us, you manage to find us out and you are able to spot us, you are able to see through our disguise and identify us, then we will go back to another 12 years of forest exile and one more year of incognito, living in incognito. And then Shakuni said, if we lose, this is the condition. And if you lose, the same conditions will be applicable to you. Look at Shakuni's cunning nature. He did not immediately say that, if you lose, these are the conditions. He said, if we lose, these are the conditions and if you lose, then same conditions will be applicable to you, making it appear very fair.

**Key Quote:** "I am bound by the instructions of my elder, which is Dhritarashtra, and therefore I unwillingly am accepting these conditions. Let the dice roll."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates Yudhishthira's acceptance of the conditions and his subsequent loss, leading to the Pandavas' exile and fueling Bhima's anger and vows of revenge.

Now, Yudhisthira Maharaj looked at Dhritarashtra, that what he had to say. Dhritarashtra was silent. Then Yudhisthira Maharaj said, I am bound by the instructions of my elder, which is Dhritarashtra, and therefore I unwillingly am accepting these conditions. Let the dice roll. And then Shakuni cast the dice. And when the dice was cast, again, Yudhisthira Maharaj lost the game of dice and Shakuni won the game of dice. Now, it was decided that the Pandavas will have to go for twelve years in forest exile followed by one year of living incognito. As far as the Kauravas were concerned, they were thrilled. Duryodhana's heart's desire had been fulfilled. Shakuni's plan had worked and the Kauravas were now in control of the kingdom of the Pandavas, Indraprastha. And Duryodhana was gleeful and he was thinking, now with time, by the time the Pandavas have finished their twelve years of exile, I would have consolidated my power, they will not be able to come back and oppose me. And after that one year of living incognito, very tough, I will be able to somehow figure them out. That was Duryodhana's thinking. And Duryodhana and the Kauravas started heaping more insults on the Pandavas. They started making fun of them. And Bhima could not control his fury and he reiterated his vow. He reminded Dushyasana, you are laughing at us now, remember I am going to, in the battle field, I am going to tear open your chest and drink your blood. And Duryodhana, you also remember, very soon we will face each other in battle and that day I will break your thighs and I will see that you bite the dust.

**Key Quote:** "Vidura requested the Pandavas to entrust Kunti in his care and as long as the Pandavas would not return, Kunti could remain in his house."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the Pandavas' preparations for exile, including entrusting Kunti to Vidura's care and sending their sons to different locations for safety and education.

So, the second game of dice only increased the fire of anger in Bhima's heart. Not only Bhima's heart, all the Pandavas' heart. Now, the Pandavas got ready. They had to, since they had to live in the forest, they could not go there with all their jewelry and their royal clothes and all that. They had to give it up and take on deer skin and tree bark and remove all their ornaments and carrying just their weapons and this very simple attire, they set out for the forest. Vidura told the Pandavas that this condition of this game of dice was not for Kunti Devi. She is already very elderly and she would not be able to bear the rigors of twelve years in the forest. So, therefore, Vidura requested the Pandavas to entrust Kunti in his care and as long as the Pandavas would not return, Kunti could remain in his house. And as far as the sons of the Pandavas were concerned, they were sent to Drupada, to Draupadi's father's place where they could grow up and they could be trained in the various duties of the Kshatriyas. Subhadra, with her young son Abhimanyu, she was sent back to Dwaraka. So, as the Pandavas' sons grew up, sometimes they would spend some time in Panchaladesha along with in Drupada's palace and sometimes they would go to Krishna's place in Dwaraka, spend some time there and like this they would, they grew up in these two households. In the meantime, the Pandavas now got ready and they left for the forest and this is how the Pandavas had to leave Indraprastha and Duryodhana won over Indraprastha in this manner and the Pandavas left for the forest. Now, what all happened in the forest when the Pandavas went on exile? Continue to remain with us and in the next few episodes we will look at what all travails the Pandavas had to undergo in the forest during their time of exile.

**Key Quote:** "At that time Shalva promised to his friend Shishupala, that, this insult to you, I will take revenge of it."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the reason why Krishna had to leave Indraprastha and return to Dwaraka: Shalva's attack, motivated by revenge for Krishna's abduction of Rukmini.

Today, we will start with some of the incidents that happened a little previously to the Game of Dice. After the Rajasuya Ejna was performed by Yudhishthira Maharaj, we all had seen how Lord Krishna stayed back in Indraprastha for a few days. After staying there for a few days, Lord Krishna, along with his retinue, he returned back to Dwaraka. Actually, for Krishna to go back to Dwaraka from Indraprastha, there was a catalyst, there was a reason why Krishna had to go back to Dwaraka. When Krishna was in Indraprastha with the Pandavas, staying in their palace built by Mayadanava, suddenly they got a news. It was not a good news, it was a matter of great concern. And what was this news? A friend of Shishupala by the name Shalva, who was a king, had attacked Dwaraka. Now, why did Shalva attack Dwaraka? When Krishna kidnapped, abducted Rukmini upon her request from her marriage, which was arranged by her brother against her wishes with Shishupala, Shishupala had brought all of his friends for the wedding. King Shalva was one amongst those who had come to attend the wedding of Shishupala. But then Krishna took away Rukmini. And although King Shalva's kingdom had come to an end even though all of Shishupala's army tried to stop Krishna, Balarama, who had come there to support his younger brother, he very easily defeated all of them and drove them back. At that time Shalva promised to his friend Shishupala, that this insult to you, I will take revenge of it. I will get some benediction by worshiping Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is in Machhtfatakana, which is one of the most crunches from Pandavas. Lord Shiva is in Machhtinese. Lord Shiva is in Machht hedge. God Chorge has 지금은 taken over K style farms. God Chorge has become Rywal masks. Arjun is giving a cheque for him as well. God Shalka, they have such pretty hats for him. That was for K 장ra by his name, isn't he? By which I will finish all the Yadavas and I will kill Krishna. Of course, who can kill Krishna? Who can touch Krishna? It is not possible. But then there are some foolish people, some atheists who think like that.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Shiva said, okay, is that all you want? Take it, take it."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Shalva performed austerities to please Lord Shiva and obtained an invincible airship, which he then used to attack Dwaraka.

Who think that they are strong enough, powerful enough to attack Krishna and kill him. So, this Shalva, he undertook severe austerity. And he meditated upon Lord Shiva. He would every day eat only a few handfuls of ash. And he would execute other various austerities like this. And Lord Shiva is Ashutosh. He is pleased very quickly. And he could not tolerate, because Lord Shiva is a great Vaishnava, is a great devotee of Lord Krishna, and all devotees of Lord Krishna are naturally very soft hearted and very compassionate. When Lord Shiva saw that this Shalva was eating just a handful of ash every day and subjecting himself to so much torture, Lord Shiva could not tolerate out of compassion and appeared before him. And he asked Shalva, what do you want? Why are you taking so much austerity? Shalva told him, I want a ship, an airship, which cannot be destroyed by any human or any animal or by any man-made weapon. And I want that this airship should be very fearsome to the Yadavas. Lord Shiva said, okay, is that all you want? Take it, take it. Somehow Lord Shiva wanted to stop his severe austerity. Now this Shalva, now with this airship, he took his whole army, and he attacked Dwaraka. There were his foot soldiers and cavalry and all such other portions of his army, which attacked Dwaraka on the ground, while Shalva himself, seated on his airship, made an air attack upon Dwaraka simultaneously. And this airship was not like our modern Rafals or any such small aircraft, which only two or three people can sit and drive. This airship was practically like a whole city, and it was equipped with various kinds of facilities, and a mini army could be accommodated within that airship. Not only that, the airship had even the ability of night vision. Even if the entire environment was immersed in darkness, the pilot could still manage to navigate the airship. So with this kind of arrangement, with his air power and with his ground force, Shalva attacked Dwaraka, and they started tearing apart all the different multi-storied buildings that had been built there. They destroyed the parks. They started attacking various houses, and they created a big bhangama in Dwaraka city. Now at that time, Lord Krishna was in Indraprastha.

**Key Quote:** "Our whole dynasty, nobody has ever run away from the battlefield. And you have taken away me from the battlefield."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the battle between Krishna's sons, led by Pradyumna, and Shalva's army, focusing on Pradyumna's temporary defeat and subsequent return to the battlefield.

After the Rajasuya Ejna. In Dwaraka at that time, only Krishna's sons were present. Immediately, all the sons of Krishna headed by Pradyumna, they responded to this attack with their own army. And Pradyumna and the others, Pradyumna, Samba and Satyaki, all these people came out onto the battlefield, and they gave a very good fight to the army of Shalva. And even though Shalva's army was huge, still the army of the Yadavas headed by Pradyumna was up to the task and they managed to beat them back. Now when this fight was going on in real earnest between these two parties, what happened? One of the commanders of Shalva by the name Dhiman, he suddenly, without warning, attacked Pradyumna because he was the foremost commander of the Yadava army. Dhiman attacked him with his mace and struck him a severe blow on his chest, and Pradyumna reeled from the sudden force of that attack and he fell down unconscious on his chariot. The charioteer immediately seeing that Pradyumna had gone unconscious, and any moment any of the enemy soldiers can capture him, immediately he drove the chariot away from the battlefield, and he took him to a place of safety, and then he sprinkled some water on him and then tried to massage his feet and slowly he brought Pradyumna back to consciousness. When Pradyumna recovered, he woke up and he started looking around and he saw, I am not on the battlefield. And then he started chastising his chariot driver, what have you done? Our whole dynasty, nobody has ever run away from the battlefield, and you have taken away me from the battlefield. If I had died on the battlefield, at least my name would have been glorified that I died fighting. Now people, everyone will make fun of me. Look at this fellow who was born in the Yadava family, the only guy in the Yadava family who ran away from the battlefield. Not only my enemies will make fun of me, even my relatives will make fun of me. My brothers will make fun of me. My sisters-in-law, they will make all kinds of memes about me. So what will I do? I cannot tolerate this. Then the charioteer replied to Pradyumna, Oh my lord, I was simply doing my duty as a charioteer. When you fell unconscious, I had to take care of your safety and so I brought you to a safe place. This is perfectly according to the codes of warfare. So you will definitely not be considered as a coward who ran away from the battlefield because you are unconscious. You did not run away. I took you away from the battlefield. So please recuperate yourself and let us go back to the battlefield. Pradyumna immediately understood the situation and he was pacified and he drank some water, refreshed himself and he came back to the battlefield. And as soon as he came back to the battlefield, Pradyumna, first of all, he challenged Dhiman and there was an intense fight, battle between the two of them. Finally, Pradyumna overcame Dhiman and he managed to vanquish him and Dhiman fell down dead in the battlefield.

**Key Quote:** "And Krishna's arrow started wreaking havoc in Shalva's army."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates Krishna's arrival in Dwaraka, his battle with Shalva, and the ultimate defeat of Shalva and his army.

Now while all this was going on, the news was taken by a messenger from Dwaraka to Lord Krishna in Indraprastha. And that is how Krishna decided, Oh, this kind of battle has started. I have to immediately leave, immediately leave for Dwaraka. And immediately Krishna took permission from Yudhishthira Maharaj and he came back to Dwaraka. The moment Krishna reached the presence of Dwaraka, he saw this raging battle going on between his sons and headed by Pradyumna and the army of Shalva and this huge fearsome airship flying in the air. So Krishna immediately spoke to Balaram and told him, You better go inside the city and take care of the elders like Ugrasena and others, and I will take care of this Shalva who has attacked us. Don't worry. And so Balarama went inside and then Krishna blew his Khans and then entered the battlefield. The moment the Yadava soldiers saw in the distance the Krishna's flag staff mounted on his chariot, with Garuda, with the symbol of Garuda, the flag of Krishna's chariot carrying the symbol of Garuda, everybody understood, Oh, Krishna has now come. And Krishna's arrow started wreaking havoc in Shalva's army. Now Shalva was no mean guy and his airship was also not ordinary. Sometimes this airship of Shalva would be seen in the sky. Sometimes it will be suddenly seen resting on some mountain. Sometimes it would be seen on the water and sometimes nobody could see it. And the airship was moving at such high speed that it had generated a dust storm and everywhere nobody could actually see what was happening. When Krishna saw this, Krishna immediately started releasing his arrows and the power of his arrows was such that the whole airship of Shalva could not move. Shalva could not sustain its illusion that it was creating, and Krishna's feather-tipped arrows, they struck Shalva's airship and that airship crashed into the water, into the ocean. But Shalva managed to break free. He managed to jump out of the airship and he landed on the battlefield and then he rushed towards Krishna. And Krishna and Shalva engaged in quite a big fight and then Shalva was releasing his own arrows. Krishna was releasing his arrows. Finally, Krishna took his Sudarsana Chakra and beheaded Shalva, and the moment this happened, the entire army of Shalva broke up because their leader was no more. Their morale was broken. The entire army's power was broken and they were scattered.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna immediately took his club which was called Kaumodaki. And with that he gave one blow to Dantavakra. Dantavakra fell down there itself and died on the battlefield."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the narrative with the arrival and defeat of Dantavakra and Viduratha, highlighting Krishna's role in vanquishing those opposed to him.

And thus the Yadavas gained victory over Shalva. But then it did not end there. Right after that came one more guy, Dantavakra. And this Dantavakra, how did he came? He came walking with just one mace in his hand. And who was this Dantavakra? Dantavakra was the son of Sutadeva, who was one of the sisters of Vasudeva. So this Dantavakra was another cousin brother of Krishna, just like Shishupala. And this, although he was the cousin brother of Krishna, he was a friend of Shishupala and he also was inimical towards Krishna. With great anger, eyes red hot, this Dantavakra came on the battlefield, and he said, Oh Krishna, you are my cousin brother. Actually, I am not supposed to fight with you, but then you have killed me. But then you have killed my friend Shalva. Shalva was a very powerful friend of mine, but somehow, little bit inattention here and there, you cheated him and you killed him. But I am going to avenge my friend. You are forcing me to come on the battlefield. I will see to that I will avenge my friend. Like this, Dantavakra came on the battlefield. So this is just like, there is a maddened elephant which is running amok and creating havoc, and somebody tries to control the elephant by his words. Hey elephant, calm down, keep quiet. I will do this, I will do that. What your words can do to control a mad elephant? He cannot do anything. It is so powerful. So Dantavakra was thinking, simply by my words, I will subdue, I will control Krishna. But who can control Krishna? Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. So Krishna told Dantavakra, why are you simply talking? Come on, you take up your club and you avenge your friend Shalva. Let us see what you will do. So Dantavakra took his mace and powerfully struck Krishna on his shoulder. What was Krishna's response? Krishna did not bat an eyelid. He did not feel even like a leaf had struck him. Krishna immediately took his club which was called Kaumodaki, and with that he gave one blow to Dantavakra. Dantavakra fell down there itself and died on the battlefield. So Shalva was killed, and now Dantavakra who came to support him was also killed. But then demons are not one. They have many many supporters. So it didn't end there. Now came his brother Viduratha. Now this Viduratha was another demon like Dantavakra and Shichupala, and he also came and attacked Krishna. Krishna simply used his Sudarsana Chakra and he finished Viduratha also. And so like this all these demons who were against Krishna were all vanquished, and Dwaraka was again safe.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna purposely did not intervene in that game of dice."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while Krishna was engaged in battle in Dwaraka, the Pandavas were being cheated in the game of dice, and Krishna allowed it to happen as part of his divine plan to annihilate the demoniac kings.

And like this Krishna entered the palace of Dwaraka. Actually while all this fight was ensuing between Krishna and Dantavakra and Shalva and Viduratha and all these people, what had happened? The Pandavas had been invited to Hastinapura, and they had been cheated of their kingdom in the game of dice, because Krishna was engaged in this battle so severely here, he was unable to attend. Otherwise Krishna would have rushed to the rescue of the Pandavas. But still Krishna being the supreme personality of Godhead, He is present as Paramagma in everybody's heart. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, that Sarvasya Chaham Hrithi Sannivishtha, and seated as Paramagma in everyone's heart. Although Krishna was standing there in the battlefield in front of Dwaraka, fighting with Shalva and Dantavakra and all these people, simultaneously Krishna protected the honor of Draupadi in that assembly. So Krishna could have stopped that game of dice, the game of dice also, but then Krishna did not do so, because it was Krishna's will, that this would become the avenue for Krishna to fulfill the purpose of his descent to this material world, which was to annihilate all the demoniac kings who were simply engaged in economic development and military aggrandizement all over the world. If you may recall that was the original purpose for Krishna's descent, and Krishna wanted to assemble all these demoniac kings in one place and finish them all at once, rather than going after them one by one, one by one, one by one. So in order to give effect to that purpose of Krishna's, Krishna purposely did not intervene in that game of dice.

**Key Quote:** "Despite all these calamities in their lives, the Pandavas, not once have they complained that, O Krishna, we are your devotees. Why is this happening to us?"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates Narada Muni's conversation with Krishna, highlighting the Pandavas' unwavering devotion and unconditional love for Krishna despite their suffering.

Now Narada Muni came to Dwaraka, and he approached Krishna, and Narada Muni is a great devotee of Krishna. He is a pure devotee. He is an unalloyed devotee of Krishna. So sometimes devotees of Krishna out of great loving affection joke with Krishna. Narada Muni sarcastically started speaking to Krishna. Krishna, the Pandavas are such great devotees of yours. They know nothing other than you. They have dedicated their life, their wealth, their everything to your lotus feet, and you have given them such a wonderful reward, such a wonderful boon, benediction you have given them in return. So Krishna said, what is that that I have given? Because of your benediction, Pandavas are now bereft of their kingdom, and Draupadi has been insulted in that assembly. She was tried to be disrobed. Dushyasana and Karna have heaped insult after insult upon them, and very nicely they are now living in the forest. Narada was indirectly criticizing Krishna, that you see, they are such unalloyed devotees, such great devotees of yours, and look at the suffering they are having to undergo on account of that. But then, Narada Muni was not really criticizing Krishna like that. Further, what Narada Muni said was more important. Narada Muni said, but then Krishna, one thing I am seeing in the Pandavas. Despite all this, despite their kingdom being taken away by cheating, despite Draupadi being tried to be disrobed in that assembly, despite being insulted by sharp words of Karna and Dushyasana and Duryodhana, despite having lost their kingdom, despite having to live in the forest for twelve years, despite having to live in incognito for one year after that, despite all these things, despite all these calamities in their lives, the Pandavas, not once have they complained that, O Krishna, we are your devotees. Why is this happening to us? On the other hand, their love for you is only increasing day by day. Every such incident, calamity that happens in their life, their love for you increases. This is incomprehensible. How this is happening. I cannot understand this. This is inexplicable. Nobody can explain the love that the Pandavas have for you. This is the nature of your devotees. Actually, the love that the Pandavas exhibited for Krishna, that unmotivated, unconditional love of the Pandavas for Krishna, such love that no matter what calamity happened in their life, their love for Krishna could never be questioned. It would never be affected.

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee always, whenever he comes across any difficulty in his life, in his heart he is not suffering any difficulty. He is only experiencing the bliss of Krishna's protection."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the perspective of a pure devotee, who sees difficulties as a result of past karma and experiences Krishna's protection even in the midst of suffering, ending with a teaser for the next episode.

This is a common characteristic of all devotees of Krishna. You look at Prahlad Maharaj. How much difficulty he had to undergo by his own father's hands, but still, never once did he question, never once did he complain, O Krishna, why is this happening to me? Not once. So the Srimad Bhagavatam says that this is the characteristic of the devotees of Krishna. The devotees, their thinking is, whenever they come across any difficulty in their life is, they think that this difficulty is coming into my life because of my past sinful activities. So, somebody may say, that okay, why don't the devotees go and pray to Krishna, please remove my difficulty? No, the devotees don't pray to Krishna to remove their difficulty. Why? Because the devotee thinks, that according to the sinful activities that I have done in my past, I should have got a mountain of miseries, but Krishna has reduced me to a small, mole hill and he has given. Look at Krishna's mercy. He has reduced my misery to such a small thing, that very easily I am able to tolerate it. So, a devotee never asks Krishna to remove his misery. A pure devotee always, whenever he comes across any difficulty in his life, in his heart he is not suffering any difficulty. He is only experiencing the bliss of Krishna's protection. See, this much distress has come in my life. If Krishna was not there in my life, I would have had to suffer much, much more, but Krishna has sent it as only a small, simple problem that very easily can be crossed over. This is how devotees are always wrapped in their love for Krishna. So also the Pandavas. Now, Krishna, when he heard, that in his absence, so much injustice has happened with the Pandavas and that they are now living in the forest in exile, what did Krishna do? Please join us in our next episode of the Mahabharata to learn about this. Thank you for joining us today.

Hare Krishna and welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. The last episode we had seen how the Pandavas have gone to the forest in exile after losing the game of dice. Purpureыйæ parله aime Lord Krishna being engaged in a battle with Shalva, Dantavakra, and Viduratha, he could not be present in the game of dice to support the Pandavas. So Krishna, when he got the news in Dvaraka that the game of dice had taken place, the Pandavas had been cheated of their kingdom, and they were now living in forest exile, Krishna immediately rushed to meet the Pandavas. The Pandavas, after losing the game of dice, as per the conditions, they left Indraprastha, and Indraprastha was taken over by Duryodhana. The Pandavas retired to the forest. There, they had built a small hermitage comprising simple patch cottages and mud flooring. They were living by wearing dresses made of tree bark. They would have to cook whatever jungle vegetables were available, and they were leading a very simple life like this. Krishna, when he came to meet the Pandavas, he was very much sorrowful to see the condition of the Pandavas, who are his great devotees. Draupadi fell at the lotus feet of Krishna and cried piteously, describing to him how she had been dragged by her hair by Dushasana into that assembly, that is, the Rajasuya Yajna assembly, and tried to be disrobed. Of course, it's not that Krishna was unaware of all this. However, Draupadi wanted to vent her grief. She wanted to share her sorrow, and Krishna was her beloved Supreme Lord, and therefore she narrated the whole incident to him. And Draupadi explained to Krishna how her hair, which had been so glorified in that Rajasuya Yajna, that by that very hair Dushyasana caught her and dragged her into that assembly. When Krishna heard what all had gone on in that assembly, Krishna's anger rose, and the Supreme Lord Krishna then, before the Pandavas, he said, "I promise all of you that all the sons of Dhritarashtra, they will have to meet you in the assembly in battle, and in the battlefield, when they engage in combat with you, all their wives will become widows. This is my promise unto you." And this was promised by Krishna to the Pandavas. And that decision, by that decision of Krishna, the lifespan of all the Kauravas was shortened. The defeat of Kurukshetra was inevitable, and the defeat of Duryodhana and his brothers was

**Key Quote:** "If we engage in pious activities, punya karma, then we are creating happiness for us in the future. If we engage in papa karma, sinful activities, we are creating distress for us in the future."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of karma, comparing pious and sinful activities to bank accounts that accumulate future happiness or suffering, contrasting Duryodhana's consumption of past piety with the Pandavas' accumulation of piety through austerities.

guaranteed by the anger of Krishna upon the Kauravas. It is said in the Vedas that whenever somebody insults a great personality, a great saint, or a great devotee of the Supreme Lord, by that act, the person reduces his lifespan and spoils his reputation and fame. Duryodhana had insulted, humiliated the Pandavas for no fault of theirs. He had humiliated Draupadi. All of them were great eternal devotees of the Supreme Lord. Duryodhana thought by doing this, he had achieved his goal of becoming a great saint. He had captured the kingdom of the Pandavas, which was Indraprastha, and he thought he had managed to cheat them. But in reality, what had happened, he had only reduced his lifespan, and forever he would be vilified and his reputation was foiled. At that point of time, Duryodhana could not understand this. So, while the Pandavas were fighting, Duryodhana could not understand this. So, while the Pandavas were fighting, Duryodhana could not understand this. So, while the Pandavas were fighting. But the Pandavas lived in austerity in the forest. Duryodhana enjoyed unrivaled sovereignty over the kingdom of both the Pandavas as well as that ruled over by Hastinapura. And he built up his alliances with various kings, and over a period of time, he became very powerful and very opulent. He was enjoying the opulences of the kings. He was enjoying the opulences of the kings. He was enjoying the opulences of the kings. He was enjoying the opulences of the kings. kingdom which rightfully belongs to the Pandavas. The Pandavas, on the other hand, they spent their time in the forest with various rishis, sages, understanding from them the finer aspects of Dharma, engaging in various yajnas and austerities, tapasya, vrata, and like this they increased their piety. Whereas Duryodhana, by enjoying that kingdom which was not rightfully his, he was reducing his piety. Piety and impiety, pious activities and sinful activities, the punya karma and the papa karma, they result in creating future happiness or suffering for us. If we engage in pious activities, punya karma, then we are creating happiness for us in the future. If we engage in papa karma, sinful activities, we are creating distress for us in the future. So the papa karma and the punya karma are like two bank accounts. They keep building up according to our activity. When we engage in pious activities, our balance in the punya karma account keeps increasing. The more balance we have in the Punya Karma, the greater happiness that we ensure for ourselves in the future life. And whenever we enjoy the result of that Punya or suffer the distress of some Papa Karma, the respective accounts of Punya and Papa start getting depleted. Therefore, while Duryodhana was enjoying the kingdom, he was consuming all of his past pious activities, whereas the Pandavas engaged in austerities and tapasya and engaging in various vows, engaged in various vratas and under and conducting various sacrifices, yajnas,

**Key Quote:** "Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that if we cook food and eat it without offering it to Krishna, we are eating verily only sin."
**Summary:** Yudhishthira Maharaj, unable to perform grand charities in exile, receives the Akshaya Patra from Suryadeva, enabling him to feed sages with Krishna prasadam, which is described as transcendental and freeing from sinful reactions.

they were building up their piety more and more. Now Yudhishthira Maharaj, because he was a very righteous king, he could not deviate from the duties of a Kshatriya. One of the prime duties of a Kshatriya is to engage in yajna and dana. This yajna, for the performance of the yajna, Yudhishthira managed to engage all the rishis who were there, the sages who were there in the forest. But for giving dana, he was no more a king. He was, he did not have access to various kinds of treasures to be able to give out gold and cows and such other things in charity. So at least the minimum that Yudhishthira Maharaj could do was to distribute yajna chishta, prasadam which had been offered in the yajna to Lord Vishnu. However, Yudhishthira Maharaj was facing difficulty even in that, because he was living in the forest and he did not have any sort of resources to be able to, to be able to cook such good foodstuff and offer in large quantities to the rishis. So when Yudhishthira Maharaj was feeling very despondent because of this, Dhaumya Rishi, who was the Kula Guru, who was the family priest of the Pandavas, he advised Yudhishthira Maharaj to worship Suryadeva, the sun god, and obtain a benediction from him by which he could be able to fulfill his desire of being able to distribute large quantities of yajna chishta or Vishnu's prasadam after conducting various sacrifices. Based on Dhaumya's instruction, Yudhishthira Maharaj engaged in tapasya, austerities, and he managed to please Suryadeva, the sun god, and the sun god, having understood his desire, gifted him a vessel, and he informed Yudhishthira Maharaj that whatever they would cook and serve from that vessel, the vessel would keep on supplying unlimited quantity of food until Draupadi takes her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj took her away. And she beckoned Yudhishthira Maharaj and told her, what if I swift away, why are you then? Why be slice up, what if I've Harma, Electoral attack, what happened in你的 head oretry make a arrives? Today's guest will be Yudhishthira Maharaj. Finally, Suryadeva was happy to meet Yudhishthira Maharaj and was surrounded by an eid festival inside the house in the room where he was staying. In the evening, the sun god, Yudhishthira Maharaj and the sun god, Yudhishthira Maharaj were gathered around... empty. And this vessel is the famous Akshaya Patra. Why is it called Akshaya Patra? Kshaya means to reduce. Akshaya means inexhaustible. So, because this vessel was inexhaustible, it could produce an unlimited quantity of food. Therefore, it was called Akshaya Patra. And now Yudhishthira Maharaj was very happy that now he could feed unlimited number of great exalted personalities, sages in the forest. And by doing this, he could continue his duties as a Kshatriya. So, like this, Yudhishthira Maharaj would conduct various sacrifices, and he would have Draupadi cook various food items to be offered to Lord Vishnu in that fire sacrifice. And he would have Draupadi cook various food items to be offered to Lord Vishnu in that fire sacrifice. And then he would distribute the Prasadam to all the sages. This is, this kind of activity is actually far beyond even Punya Karma, even pious activities. To feed a qualified person, like a Sadhu or a saintly person, is actually a Punya Karma, is a pious activity in itself. But then, Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that if we cook food and eat it without offering it to Krishna, we are eating verily only sin. On the other hand, if we cook food offered to Krishna and then partake of it, then we are freed from all sinful activities. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj, by feeding Vishnu's prasadam offered to Lord Vishnu in the sacrifices, in the yajnas, he was distributing Krishna prasadam to all the sages. And so, that prasadam was transcendental and its effect was,

**Key Quote:** "It was a golden lotus with a thousand petals."
**Summary:** The Pandavas continue their austere life on Gandhamadana Hill, where Draupadi finds a golden lotus, prompting Bhima to embark on a quest to find more, encountering challenges and a mysterious animal.

whoever would honor that prasadam, they would become free from all the reactions to their past activities. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj and the Pandavas and Draupadi spent their time very fruitfully within the forest, continuing to engage in their past activities, unlike Duryodhana, who was simply engaged in sense gratification and reducing the accumulations, all that he simply kept consuming without engaging in any pious activities, without engaging in dana, tapasya, yajna, etc., which are actually the duties of a Kshatriya, of a king. Like this, time passed and once the Pandavas happened to reach a place known as Kshatriya. Like this, time passed and once the Pandavas happened to reach a place known as Kshatriya. Like this, time passed and once the Pandavas happened to reach a place known as Gandhamadana Hill. This Gandhamadana Hill is said to be beyond even the Kailasa Parvatha in the Himalayas. The Pandavas had come there because it was considered a very holy place which even the celestials visit. During this time, Arjuna also went seeking favors from various devatas During this time, Arjuna also went seeking favors from various devatas During this time, Arjuna also went seeking favors from various devatas to accumulate various kinds of celestial weapons because as advised by Lord Krishna, Arjuna would have to collect all these things which would be necessary for him to engage in the forthcoming war which all the Pandavas could sense that it was going to be inevitable although they did not desire such a war. The Pandavas continued to live in austerity. The Pandavas continued to live in austerity. As I had mentioned earlier, the Pandavas continued to live in austerity. To pushes out the région, Heidi had to go into the parlour of огay and go to Kseti, etc., I had mentioned wearing a dress made out of tree barks, engaging in various kinds of austerities, tapasyas, vratas, etc., even on Gandhamadana hill. Once, while the Pandavas were there in Gandhamadana hill, Draupadi, one day in the morning, she found a gentle breeze blowing, and in the breeze, she found one flower floating towards her, and this flower was no ordinary flower. It was a golden lotus with a thousand petals. Generally, lotus has a few petals. Sahasra, Dala, Kamala, even within this world, to get a lotus, which has a thousand petals, is very, very rare. Now, this was a Sahasra, Dala, Kamala. It was a thousand-petal lotus, and it was also golden. When Draupadi saw this, her mind became very much attracted by this flower, and she thought, this is such a beautiful flower, I should offer this to my husband, Yudhisthira Maharaj, so that he can use it in his yajnas. Thinking like this, she picked up the flower. And then Bhima happened to be there, and she looked at Bhima, and she said, how I wish that we had more of these flowers, so that I could offer it to Yudhisthira Maharaj. So, Bhima looked at Draupadi, and he said, my dear lady, if that is your wish, I will carry it out. And so, what did Bhima do? Bhima looked at the direction in which the flower had come. The flower had come from a breeze which was flowing towards them, from the north-eastern direction. So, Bhima started walking through the forest in that path, in the direction from which the breeze was blowing. So, it was a forest. So, naturally, there were many animals. There were lions, there were tigers, elephants, and all such kinds of animals were occupying the forest. So, when Bhima started walking through the forest, he saw that there were many animals. So, when Bhima started walking in the forest, naturally, sometimes some animals would come and attack him. But Bhima very easily, very nonchalantly, he just slapped away lions and tigers and picked up elephants very nonchalantly and threw them away. He was so powerful. And so, like this, Bhima made his way in the direction of where, from where the breeze was blowing. He came across a beautiful lake. And there were many beautiful flowers there. There also Bhima searched, maybe I can find this golden thousand petal lotus here. But he could not find it. So, everywhere he was searching like this and he was going forward. So, finally, after travelling quite a distance, he came to a place where he saw a strange animal lying on his path. What was this strange animal? And what was it doing there? And how did it get there? And how did Bhima deal with it? Because for Bhima, until then, he had come across many ferocious animals in the forest and he had dispatched all of them very easily. So, for Bhima, it was not a big deal. So, he was not afraid upon seeing this somewhat different looking and wonderful animal. So, but then Bhima understood when he looked at this animal that this was no ordinary animal. All the other animals were not ordinary animals. All the other animals were not ordinary animals. Till then, whom he had met were all normal forest animals. But this animal seemed a little different. So, what was this animal? And when Bhima looked at it, he carefully looked at it analyzing, is this really an animal or is it some Rakshasa in disguise waiting to pounce upon me, attack me and when I am a little neglectful, when I am not a little careful, maybe he wants to capture me. So, Bhima looked at it and said, he wants to capture me. Bhima thinking in these ways, he approached, he cautiously he approached the animal. Now who was this animal and what happened when Bhima approached it? Please join us in the next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today.

**Summary:** Review of the previous episode, highlighting the Pandavas' pious activities in exile versus Duryodhana's sense gratification.

Welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the previous episode, we have seen how the Pandavas lived in the forest in exile, increasing their pious credit, by engaging in various kinds of austerities, tapasyas, conducting various Ejna's sacrifices with the help of the sages and the rishis in the forest, and distributing the Ejna Sista or Vishnu's Prasadam to everyone who attended their sacrifices. At the same time, we also saw how Guryodhana engaged in various kinds of sense gratification without engaging in activities of tapasya, dana, etc., thereby simply diminishing the pious credits he had accumulated over his past life. We also saw how when the Pandavas were living in Gandhamadana hill, Draupadi came across a beautiful golden thousand petaled lotus and she requested Bhima to get more of this at Bhima's temple.

**Key Quote:** "So the man was also very happy and he took the deities to his home and personally started worshipping them with great respect and affection."
**Summary:** A story from the time of Lord Ramachandra illustrating the deep connection between the Lord and His devotees, and the importance of deity worship.

To begin today's episode, we will take you to the time of Lord Ramachandra who ruled over the earth several millions of years ago during the age known as Treta Yuga. The current age in which we all live in is called Kali Yuga which lasts for 432,000 years out of which 5000 years have passed by. The age previous to this was called Dwapara Yuga which lasted for 864,000 years and the age previous to that was Treta Yuga which lasted for 1,296,000 years. It was during the time of Treta Yuga that Lord Ramachandra ruled over the world from his capital Ayodhya. Ayodhya is very close to the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh which is Lucknow. Now when Lord Ramachandra was ruling over Ayodhya accompanied by his brothers, the citizens were all great devotees of Lord Ramachandra and Lord Ramachandra also ruled over them exactly like a very loving father would take care of his children. There were many devotees who rendered loving devotional service to Lord Ramachandra during that time. There was one particular devotee of Lord Ramachandra in Ayodhya. His devotion to Lord Ramachandra was so great that every day he would come to the court, have darshan of Lord Ramachandra and then go back and only then he would have his meals. Without having darshan of Lord Ramachandra, one would never have darshan of Lord Ramachandra, this is a very rare fact. And there was a man without having first seen the supreme Lord Ramachandra. This man would never have his meals. Once Lord Ramachandra had to go out of Ayodhya for about five, six days on some important work. Now during this time this gentleman because he could not see Lord Ramachandra refused to eat anything; he would not even drink water. So like this, one day, two days, three days, days went by like this but this man would not relent from following his austerity, from following his vow. Lord Ramachandra, after finishing his work, when he returned to Ayodhya, then Lakshmana, his younger brother, introduced this gentleman, this devotee to Lord Ramachandra and he explained to him how this man was so devoted to Lord Ramachandra that while he was not there, he has not even taken a drop of water. So Lord Ramachandra was very much affected by this person's devotion and he thought that there may be some other instance like this where I may have to go out and if this person doesn't see me and he doesn't eat his food, it is not good. So Lord Ramachandra instructed Lakshmana to bring out a set of deities of Sita and Rama. These deities of Sita and Rama had been worshipped by the sun god and it had been handed over by him to his son, Ikshwaku and like this, generation after generation, he was worshipped by the sun god and he was worshipped by the deities of Sita and Rama. During Lord Ramachandra's time, when he was personally present, because of his personal presence, there was no need to worship those deities which had come, handed over from one king to the other in that dynasty in which Lord Ramachandra himself appeared. So when Lord Ramachandra was personally present, he said that there is no need for these deities right now and they were kept locked up in a closet. Lord Ramachandra recalled these deities and he instructed his younger brother, Lakshmana, to bring those deities and Lord Ramachandra gave it to that devotee and he told him that if for some reason you are not able to see me then you can see these deities of mine which is as good as seeing me personally so then you will not be any seglude about anyone. In his mind, Lord Ramachandra said that these deities, when they meet each other, this is meant to have atmosphere and though these deities are known but they know each other very well. When they meet each other, he will not touch these Deities for too long置 quite accurately. This 50-60e thick stone and he said Lord Ramachandra did not recognize these then you will not have to take the trouble of having to fast if on some day you are not

**Summary:** Explanation of the true happiness of devotees, which lies in serving and associating with the Lord, not in material pleasures.

So the man was also very happy and he took the deities to his home and personally started worshipping them with great respect and affection. So we can see from this exchange how the Supreme Lord is very very dear to his devotees. The devotees are also very dear to the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord takes every care possible to keep his devotees always happy. And when we say the Lord wants to keep his devotees happy, the devotees are not happy by engaging in some activities of sense gratification. They are not happy by having good food to eat, good clothes to wear, having a nice luxurious residence. They are not interested in all these things. What gives pleasure to the devotees is to be able to see the Lord, to be able to constantly chant the holy names of the Lord, to be able to constantly remember the past times of the Supreme Lord and to thus always remain in his association. So this, just like this devotee, he because he was a great devotee of Lord Ramachandra, Lord Ramachandra knew that nothing would satisfy him except to be always in his presence. And so the Lord understanding what would keep him happy.

**Key Quote:** "So Bhima told the monkey, you see, in your heart, Paramatma is there. So therefore, if I cross over your body, I will be crossing over Paramatma, which will be a great offense."
**Summary:** The story of Bhima encountering Hanuman in the forest, highlighting Bhima's respect for Paramatma present in all beings.

So now we come back to the forest where Bhima had come across this strange animal. Bhima looked upon this animal with wonder. This animal looked like an ordinary monkey, but then its whole body had a golden hue and it was faintly effulgent. And this monkey was lying on the ground as if he was sleeping in the path. So Bhima, because his path was blocked, he spoke to the monkey and he told him, that oh monkey, you are lying in my path, please wake up and give way. This monkey slowly raised its head and looked at Bhima and he said, I am very old, it is not possible for me to get up and all that. Why have you come here? Why are you troubling me like this? This is my place, you seem to be some new person, why do you want to go this way? So Bhima introduced himself. He said, I am Bhima, one of the Pandavas and I am going on this path searching for a golden thousand petaled lotus. So this monkey looked at Bhima and he told him, see that lotus what you are talking about is not available in all these ordinary earthly planets. It is there in the heavenly planet. And this path which you are walking on leads you to the heavenly planet. And so ordinary people like you and all cannot go to the heavenly planet. So you go back, don't trouble me, you go back. Now Bhima became very upset. He said, what do you think of yourself? Who are you to stop me? If you don't step aside on your own, I will pick you up and throw you aside. Now this monkey, he looked at him and he said, why are you troubling me? If you are so insistent that you want to go, you step over me and go, no, why I should get up and all this and you should throw me and all that. You just cross over me and you go. Then Bhima looked at the monkey and he said, you see, I cannot cross over you because as Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, sarvasya caaham hrithi sannyavishtha, the Lord as Paramatma is seated in every living entity's heart. So Bhima knew this, that Krishna is present as Paramatma in every living entity's heart, even in the heart of animals, not just human beings. Even in the heart of the monkey also, Paramatma is present. So Bhima told the monkey, you see, in your heart, Paramatma is there. So therefore, if I cross over your body, I will be crossing over Paramatma, which will be a great offense. Therefore I will not commit that offense of crossing over you, you will have to either get up and give me way, or I will pick you up and throw you aside. Then Bhima told the monkey, see, if I did not know this, that the Paramatma is there in your heart, I would have jumped across you very easily, just like Hanumanji jumped over

the ocean for Lord Ramachandra. So this monkey immediately looked at him and took notice and he said, Hanumana, who is this Hanuman? What did he do? Why did he jump across the ocean? So then Bhima told him that Hanumanji is a great devotee of Lord Ramachandra. So he said, Hanumanji, who is this Hanuman? Why did he jump across the ocean? So then Bhima told him that Hanumanji is a great devotee of Lord Ramachandra, and he was also Vanara like you. When Ramana, the Asura, he kidnapped Sita Devi, wife of Lord Ramachandra to search and find her out, Hanumanji jumped across the ocean and he delivered, he found where Sita Maya was and he came back and delivered the message to Ramachandra. Anyway that and all is separate. Now you get up and give way. So then the monkey said, see, it is very difficult for me to move. My tail is lying there. You, it is in one side. You remove my tail and then you walk across. So, then Bhima looked at him and he said, what monkey, you know, simply creating trouble for me. He wants me to pick up his tail and keep it aside. Okay, anyway, let me do it. He went and he used his left hand to pick up the tail of the monkey. Then Bhima is holding the monkey's tail and pulling. It is not moving. Bhima was little surprised. He thought very easily like, you know, monkey's tail, how difficult it is to move. So, then he thought very easily he will be able to move, but this is not moving. So, he was carrying his gada with him. He kept it aside and then he used his right hand also. With both hands, he started pulling. But this tail is not moving. So, Bhima realized, this is not some ordinary monkey and this is not some ordinary tail. So, he started putting his full effort because now, it was a matter. It was a matter of prestige for him. And he is using his full energy and power and he is perspiring, but this tail is not moving. Then Bhima stepped aside and he understood that this is not some ordinary monkey because Bhima's power is such that no ordinary person can face him and this ordinary monkey's tail is not able to lift. So, this is definitely some extraordinary being. So, Bhima stepped aside and then he apologized to the monkey. He said, it looks like you seem to be some celestial personality. You are not an ordinary monkey. I am sorry that I spoke to you in an insulting way. Please forgive me and please reveal yourself. Then this monkey looked at him and he said, you spoke about somebody called Hanuman, no? I am that Hanuman. Bhima was astonished. Oh, Hanumanji has come. He immediately offered his obeisances. And ultimately because Hanumanji is the son of Vayudev and Bhima was also begotten by Kunti Devi according to the blessings of Vayudev. In that sense, both of them are brothers also.

**Key Quote:** "And Hanumanji, from that time, was carrying it in a piece of cloth tied around his neck. And every day, he would ecstatically worship them."
**Summary:** Hanuman hands over the deities of Sita and Rama to Bhima, tracing their lineage from Ikshwaku to Madhvacharya and the Udupi temple.

So, then Bhima was very happy to meet Hanumanji because Hanumanji is also a great devotee of the Lord. Bhima is also a pure devotee of the Lord. So, then Bhima asked, requested Hanumanji to narrate the whole Ramayana to him. And so, Hanumanji very ecstatically, he described the whole Ramayana pastime of the Supreme Lord Ramachandra to Bhima. Then Hanumanji was carrying deities of Sita and Rama tied around his neck. So, he took those deities and he handed it over to Bhima and he gave it to him and he said, these are the deities of Lord Rama and Sita which were originally worshipped by Ikshwaku himself. And during Lord Ramachandra's personal presence, these deities were not being worshipped, but the Lord handed it over to one devotee in his kingdom who, because that devotee had taken a vow not to eat anything until he would have darshan of the Supreme Lord. This is the same devotee who had gotten the deities of Sita and Rama from Lord Ramachandra himself. And when that devotee, as long as he was alive, he was worshipping those deities of Rama and Sita. But when the time came for him to depart, to give up his body, at that time, he handed over these Sita and Rama deities to Hanumanji. And Hanumanji, from that time, was carrying it in a piece of cloth tied around his neck and every day, he would ecstatically worship them. And now, Hanumanji handed over the same deities to Bhima. So, Bhima received them with great respect and he took those deities. As long as Bhima was present on this earth, Bhima kept those deities very carefully and he would worship them every day. Of course, it is said that today, those deities were further, after the time of the Pandavas, were handed down further to their descendants and eventually, it reached the hands of Madhvacharya and he kept them in the Udupi temple. And it is said that even today, that Udupi temple, there are the deities of Sita and Rama, who are the same deities who were worshipped by Ikshwaku and then, handed over by Rama to his devotee, who handed it over to Hanumanji, who handed it over to Bhima and Bhima handed over to his descendants and finally, it is now in the temple of Udupi.

**Key Quote:** "Then, Hanumanji assured him that because the Pandavas were all devotees of Lord Krishna, he would definitely help them."
**Summary:** Hanuman promises to support the Pandavas, and Bhima returns to Draupadi with the lotuses, while the Pandavas continue their life in exile, moving between different forests.

So, Bhima then, taking the requested Hanumanji, that he should support them in some way, whenever the need would arise, when the Pandavas would have to face the Kauravas in battle. Then, Hanumanji assured him that because the Pandavas were all devotees of Lord Krishna, he would definitely help them and he said he would help them by being personally present on the flag of Arjuna during the battle, which would take place between them and the Kauravas. And then, Bhima left Hanumanji there and he went further and he approached the celestial planets, which was the abode of Kuvera and there he found that lake, where there were many, many golden thousand petal lotuses and he picked a few of them and he brought them back to Draupadi. So, like this, the Pandavas were engaging in various activities during their stay. They were going back and forth between two forests, the Kamyaka forest and the Dwaitavana forest. Dwaitavana forest is said to be modern day Dev Vandh. Dwaitavana was also known as Dev Vandh and now it came to be known as Dev Vandh which is near Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Kamyakavana is said to be a forest which is close to Thar desert. It is further up northwards and the Dwaitavana is down south from Kamyakavana. So, the Pandavas were largely going between these two. Sometimes they would go to the Himalayas and like this they would keep going to various parts of the forest and they would build a hermitage there, live for some time and like this they were going.

**Summary:** The Pandavas' exile nears its end, causing anxiety for Dhritarashtra but increasing Duryodhana's false confidence, leading to a plan to flaunt his opulence before the Pandavas.

The Pandavas were spending their time. Now time went by and slowly the years passed by. One year, two years, three years, four years like this they entered the twelfth year in forest exile. In Hastinapura, Dhritarashtra was counting the days and as the time came closer for the Pandavas forest exile to get over, Dhritarashtra's blood pressure was going up. He was becoming more and more anxious because he knew the Pandavas were righteous and he was also repenting whatever had happened to the Pandavas. So, he knew that unless the Pandavas were given their rightful kingdom eventually there could be war and if war was there then definitely Duryodhana did not stand a chance. Duryodhana on the other hand he was merrily spending his time enjoying life and oblivious of the fact that the forest exile was coming to a close instead of becoming anxious Duryodhana was becoming more and more cocksure of himself because he was building up his alliances and his opulence was increasing his military strength was increasing so he was under the false confidence that his power is increasing while the Pandavas are in exile when they come back who is going to support them so this was Duryodhana's thinking so when the 12th year came then Karna came to Duryodhana and he said long time over we have been enjoying like this and Duryodhana has become very opulent you become very powerful all these things are there and you know by our by our plans by our scheme we managed to keep the Pandavas very far away so but then you know simply enjoying like this is doesn't full maja is not there we should go and show off to the Pandavas you know let us go and show them what we have got and how we are enjoying so you know a little bit let us finger them so Duryodhana heard this and he said ah very good idea let us do that so Duryodhana thought let me let us you know go and show off let me go up and go to the forest and show off my power and my opulence to the Pandavas so he started making arrangements to uh to you know get together a large army thousands of horses thousands of elephants and and we have all the women folk and carrying lot of jewels and ornaments and all that he thought let us go to where the Pandavas are there in Dwaitavana and let us show off what power and opulence I've got like this he started getting ready now when Duryodhana was planning like this to go and and insult the Pandavas and show off his opulence and power what happened please join us in the next episode to learn about this thank you for joining us today Hare Krishna

**Key Quote:** "In this way the Pandavas were going on accumulating pious credits. On the other hand Duryodhana was merely enjoying all the royal opulence and he was not engaged in conducting any fire sacrifice or yajnas."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Pandavas' austere life in exile, focused on spiritual practices, with Duryodhana's opulent lifestyle and envy, setting the stage for Duryodhana's plan to show off his wealth.

Welcome to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode we have seen how the Pandavas, being in the forest exile, were engaged in executing various kinds of austerity. They were living in the forest, sometimes shuttling between Dwaitavana and Kamyakavana. They were living in simple thatched cottages with mud flooring. They were wearing dresses made out of tree bark. And they were constantly engaged in conducting yajna, sacrifices to please Lord Vishnu. And having obtained from the sun god, Suryadeva, a magical pot which could produce unlimited amount of food for feeding the guests. With that Draupadi would everyday cook and feed large number of saintly people who would come and attend the yajnas conducted by Yudhishthir Maharaj. In this way the Pandavas were going on accumulating pious credits. On the other hand Duryodhana was merely enjoying all the royal opulence and he was not engaged in conducting any fire sacrifice or yajnas. He was simply enjoying the power and opulence of the royal household and thus he was using up all his previous pious credits. Two contrasting things we were able to see. And when the Pandavas entered the twelfth year of their forest exile, Duryodhana based on the instigation by Karna decided to go to Dwaitavana to show off his opulence. How much wealth he had acquired and with all the women folk, with all the resources, with some small army with him. He wanted to go there and show off to the Pandavas because look out how I am enjoying life and how you people are suffering. During these twelve years, Duryodhana had spent time not only in increasing the strength of his army but also in striking of alliances with various friendly kings and he was like this building up his army power. So that he knew later when the Pandavas would come to seek their kingdom back, he could very easily rebuff.

**Key Quote:** "Now when Duryodhana heard this proposal from Karna that it is good to go and show up to the Pandavas and rub salt on their wounds, it appealed very much to Duryodhana because we all have seen how Duryodhana is very envious by nature and he liked to insult the Pandavas although there was no fault on their side."
**Summary:** Duryodhana, motivated by envy and instigated by Karna, seeks permission from Dhritarashtra to visit Dwaitavana under the guise of inspecting cows, concealing his true intention to humiliate the Pandavas.

Now when Duryodhana heard this proposal from Karna that it is good to go and show up to the Pandavas and rub salt on their wounds, it appealed very much to Duryodhana because we all have seen how Duryodhana is very envious by nature and he liked to insult the Pandavas although there was no fault on their side. Now for Duryodhana to go to Dwaitavana, an excuse was needed. So he went to his father Dhritarasva and he told him that the time has come to count, to take count of all the cows. And inspect them for their health and well-being whether the caretakers are taking good care of them or not. So I am planning to go with a small retinue, with a small portion, segment of my army I want to take and all the women folk and my wife and all those people I want to take them and go to the place where the cows are currently which happens to be Dwaitavana. Dhritarasva when he heard this, immediately he said, why are you going to Dwaitavana? The Pandavas are already there, if you go there and by chance both of you come to meet each other, I don't want another fight between the two of you. So why you have to go? Send some important minister or general or somebody like that, why do you have to personally go? But then Duryodhana was adamant, he wanted to go himself although he could not openly express it to Dhritarasva. Then Shakuni also supported Duryodhana and told Dhritarasva, why we will go to Dwaitavana? Why? All the Pandavas, they are already in forest exile, they are practically nobody now, why will we go to them? Forget it, we are going for our other purpose, we will keep away from them. So Dhritarasva finally relented and he said, okay, if you want to go, we are very insistent you go but don't trouble the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana with his retinue, he reached Vaithavana and which is said to be modern day Dev Vand in Uttar Pradesh and having reached there, he inspected all the cows, took count of them, asked about the health, he looked up the health records of all the cows and having considered all these things, having finished all his duties."
**Summary:** Duryodhana travels to Dwaitavana with his army and advisors, completing the pretense of inspecting the cows, and then sends scouts to find a suitable location to set up camp near the Pandavas to flaunt his opulence.

Now having got Dhritarasva's permission, Duryodhana took off with his small army, few horses, a few foot soldiers and some chariots like that, few means a few thousand, not that small also. And then Duryodhana was accompanied by Karna, Shakuni and Dushasana and his other brothers who all wanted to see the fun, how the Pandavas are going to be, you know, they are going to be insulted and they are going to be humiliated, that was the, they wanted to join in the fun. So they all went. Duryodhana with his retinue, he reached Vaithavana and which is said to be modern day Dev Vand in Uttar Pradesh and having reached there, he inspected all the cows, took count of them, asked about the health, he looked up the health records of all the cows and having considered all these things, having finished all his duties. Then he went. He sent some people to figure out in the Vaithavana where the Pandavas are and he told his people go and set up camp close to where they are in such a way that they can see us and we will have some revelry and some celebration and we will have some dancing, music and all those kind of things and that will rub the Pandavas this one ego, that was Duryodhana's this one. So the few people, some few soldiers from his army, they went seeking out a place where they could set camp and also in such a way that it would be visible for the Pandavas. The Pandavas at that moment, Yudhishthira Maharaj was engaged in a fire sacrifice, a yajna was going on and he was along with a few other Rishis and Sages and Ramanas who were conducting the fire sacrifice, he was involved in that. The Pandavas of course were totally unaware of Duryodhana's impending visit. So this small group of army was going forward, they came across the place near a lake on the bank of the lake where the Pandavas were being seated.

**Summary:** Gandharvas, sent by Indra due to Duryodhana's malicious intentions, arrive in Dwaitavana and prevent Duryodhana's forces from setting up camp, leading to an impending conflict.

Now in the meantime unknown to both the Pandavas and to Duryodhana what had happened. Some Gandharvas had come there, to that forest. Now these Gandharvas are celestial beings. They are not limited in their travel like we are if we have to go to some planet some other planet outside the earth planet let us say we want to go to the moon or the mars or something like that there are so many restrictions it's not easy to go there for human beings but the gandharvas are not because they are from the upper planets they are not limited in their travel like that they can very easily travel to whichever planet they want and if they so choose they can remain hidden to the view of the human beings or if they want they can reveal themselves also so in this case the gandharvas they stopped the team which duryodhana had sent for and they told them you cannot come to this part of the forest this belongs to us so you please go back so these small team members they because gandharvas they are celestial beings they went back to duryodhana and conveyed to him that like this we were stopped by the gandharvas and they refused to allow us to set camp there now duryodhana being the kind of arrogant person he is he said what gandharvas this is my kingdom i will do whatever i want here i will not listen to any gandharvas and all that then he called all his small army together and he went and he attacked the gandharvas now the gandharvas were very well prepared for this attack from duryodhana because they had come specifically there for that purpose to to engage in a battle with duryodhana now why would they come there to engage in a battle with duryodhana why did the gandharvas have to come down from the celestial planet actually what had happened was when duryodhana had made his plans to go to dvaitavana and to humiliate the pandavas the new dvaitavana had to go to dvaitavana and to humiliate the crakoosrit hindra and hindra was always very favorable to the pandavas especially to arjuna because arjuna was born to kuntidevi from the blessings of hindradeva so in one sense hindra was the father of arjuna so he did not like this activity from this act of duryodhana's where he wanted to humiliate the pandavas Gandharvas and told them, see like this Duryodhana is going to Dwaitavana with an evil intention, you go and take care of him.

**Summary:** A battle ensues between Duryodhana's army and the Gandharvas, resulting in the Kauravas' defeat, the cowardly retreat of Karna, Shakuni, and Dushasana, and Duryodhana's capture.

with their weapons. Now, a fierce battle started with between the small army of Duryodhana along with Karna, Shakuni, Dushasana and others and on the other side, a small group of the Gandharvas. Now, although Karna was a powerful archer, Duryodhana himself was a great warrior. Despite all this, the Gandharvas being celestial beings, gradually they drove back Duryodhana's army. Finally, what happened? Shakuni ran away from the battlefield when he saw that his life was in danger. So also, when Karna saw that his arrows were failing and he too was in a very precarious condition, he along with Dushasana and the other brothers of Duryodhana, they all ran away from the battlefield. Actually, a Kshatriya is never supposed to show his back in a battle. A Kshatriya is supposed to fight till the death. But this cowardly act from the side of Karna and Dushasana and others was not surprising because they were used to very boastful and ostentatious claims, although they did not have the real powers like the Pandavas. That is why they were always envious of the Pandavas because the Pandavas actually, even though they were very humble and very nice people, the Kauravas, Karna and Duryodhana and others knew that the Pandavas were, always far more powerful than them and far more opulent than them. That was why Duryodhana and Karna and others were always envious of the Pandavas. Be that as it may, the whole Kaurava army was defeated, it was routed, practically almost all their army was destroyed, and Karna, Dushasana and others, Shakuni and others, ran away from the battlefield in a cowardly manner. Now, Duryodhana stood fighting there and finally, Duryodhana was captured by the Dandarvas. So, whatever little bit of Duryodhana's army was left, they ran away.

**Summary:** Duryodhana's remaining soldiers seek help from the Pandavas, who, despite knowing Duryodhana's intentions, are bound by their Kshatriya dharma to offer protection.

But still, they were lamenting that our master has been captured, now what to do? So they consulted amongst themselves and they thought it wise to approach the Pandavas and seek their help because they were close at hand to go back to Hastinapura and to call Bhishma Dev and bring him back and Dronacharya and others was practically next to impossible. Something had to be done right there, right then. So this remaining small group of people, the soldiers went and approached Yudhishthir Maharaj who was in the midst of performing the Ejna and they narrated the whole thing before him. Of course, this group of soldiers, they did not know Duryodhana's evil intention, his malified intention in coming there to actually humiliate the Pandavas. They were thinking he came here to count the cows and all those kind of things and after finishing all that, he wanted to just sit, camp there, relax a little bit and go back to Hastinapura. That was their understanding. The moment Pandavas heard that Duryodhana had come there and he had been captured by the Gandharvas, they immediately understood what was the background of this whole incident. And the moment they heard that Duryodhana had been captured, Bhima uttered, Bhishma uttered these words... Bhima said, We would have had to undergo a great effort and endeavor with a great assembly of horses and elephants and chariots and soldiers, in order to get it. There was aור Atharnas when he was one. defeat duryodhana and capture him what we could have achieved with great endeavor the gandharvas have achieved it very easily so bhima was appreciating the gandharvas that what we would have taken great endeavor to do that the gandharvas have done very good we are saved of the great

And gradually, with a heavy heart, they all came back to Hastinapura. Now, Duryodhana, although initially he was very much afflicted by this humiliation at the hands of the Pandavas, gradually, after a little while, he forgot the incident and came back to his normal self. And being the arrogant person he was, he again started, he started plotting how to humiliate the Pandavas. So, it so happened that one great sage happened to come to Hastinapura. And when Duryodhana heard that, about this sage's arrival in Hastinapura, immediately a plan started hatching in his mind. So what was the plan that Duryodhana had newly thought up of? And who was the sage? And what was the role he was going to play in Duryodhana's new plot? Please join us in the next episode of the Mahabharata to learn about this. Thank you for joining us today.

### Lord Krishna, Yajnas, Demigods

**Key Quote:** "Each of them is not God. They are all demigods. Meaning, they are more powerful than human beings but they are not God himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Lord Krishna's role as the supreme enjoyer of sacrifices and introduces the concept of demigods and their responsibilities.

Before we start that, we have to understand one wonderful quality about Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that Lord Krishna is the supreme Enjoyer of all the fire sacrifices which are mentioned in the Vedas. What are Yajnas? What are these fire sacrifices? As Lord Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita, when the creation happened at the beginning of the creation, Brahmaji created human beings as well as Devatas. Devatas are the demigods and the demigods as we all know, they are said to be 33 crore in number. There is Indra, Chandra, Vayu, Durga, Lord Shiva, Ganesha, etc. So many personalities are there. Who are these Devatas or who are these demigods? Each of them is not God. They are all demigods, meaning they are more powerful than human beings but they are not God himself. They are lower than God but higher than human beings. Therefore, they are called demigods.

**Key Quote:** "So, these demigods are interested with various administrative responsibilities in running this universe."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the demigods' role in administering the universe, drawing an analogy to government departments and their functions.

So, these demigods are interested with various administrative responsibilities in running this universe and there are duties. Knowledge is one of the most important things in running this universe. Chanta has explained how we could keep up with the existence of these elements in each and every present form. So this universe is running in a very systematic manner. Seasons come and go in a particular cycle. The sun rises and sets at specific times in specific directions. Similarly with the moon also. The ocean maintains its limits etc, etc. Like this, if we observe nature, we can see how nature is running things so systematically, the cause of the superintendence of all these Arbeits load sets of all these demigods. Now Brahmaji, when he created all these human beings, also Brahmaji's intention was that these devatas or demigods would administer the universe in such a way that the human beings would be able to lead their lives peacefully, they would be able to have a harmonious life and the human beings would also be able to utilize their human body to understand higher spiritual subject matter and liberate themselves permanently from this material world and go back to Godhead. This is the whole scheme of things. Now this is just like the government is having many many departments, the electricity department, the water department, the drainage department, the roadways department, the public works department, so many departments of the government's new innumerable departments the government has. Now what is the intention of the government creating so many departments and having so many employees and bureaucrats and all that? The idea is to administer the state or the country in a very proper manner so that the citizens can live peacefully, they can execute their activities and they can live harmoniously and they can carry out

**Key Quote:** "The human beings, when they conduct Yajnas, that will be the process by which they will pay their fees to the devatas, to the demigods."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of Yajnas as a way for humans to express gratitude to the demigods, and the consequences of neglecting them.

they can fulfill all their whatever their desires are. This is the intention of the government. Now for the government to be able to do all this, they need money. Where will they get the money from? They tax the citizens. The citizens have to pay income tax, they have to pay GST, they have to pay the electricity bill, they have to pay the water bill. So without the citizens paying the requisite fees, the government cannot function. In a similar way, for the devatas, for the demigods also to administer this universe, they need such a government to be able to do all this so that the certain fees. But what fees they need is not our paper currency. That is of no value to them. In fact, in India, rupee has value. The same rupees, if you go to the US and try to buy anything with that, it will not run. So, even within this earth, the currencies don't run from one country to another. So, how can we expect the devatas to take our money? It will not work. But some way, the human beings have to express their gratitude to the devatas, to the demigods for administering this universe so that everyone can peacefully, harmoniously execute their duties. So, how to do that? That also, Brahmaji, when he created this universe, he said at the beginning of creation that I will also create Yajnas. The human beings, when they conduct Yajnas, that will be the process by which they will pay their fees to the devatas, to the demigods. So, this is the whole arrangement. The human beings, they perform Yajnas, devatas are pleased, they will send ample amount of rain, sunshine and everything will be in proper order. The moment there is any discrepancy in this performance of these Yajnas, there will be natural disturbances. There will be floods, there will be earthquakes, there will be tsunamis, there will be volcanoes, there will be pandemics and such other things

### Yajnas, Lord Vishnu, Krishna's Supremacy

**Key Quote:** "But no matter what Yajna you do for whichever devata it is... the Yajna Pati, the chief person in every Yajna has to be Vishnu."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Lord Vishnu is the chief recipient of all Yajnas and the supreme controller of all universes.

will take over. So, although the Vedas prescribe different Yajnas for different devatas, for Ganesha, there is one type of Yajna, for Lord Shiva, there is another set of Yajnas, for pleasing Lord Surya, the sun god, there are another set of Yajnas. So, there are so many Yajnas, Pratas, etc. described for the different devatas. But no matter what Yajna you do for whichever devata it is, whether it is Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesha, Indra, Vayu, Surya, for whomever you do, the Yajna Pati, the chief person in every Yajna has to be Vishnu. Without that, even the devatas will not accept the offerings given in the Yajnas. So, Krishna has declared in the Bhagavad Gita, He is Sarvaloka Maheshwara. You can imagine, all the Edhnyas that we perform, he is the chief recipient of all the Edhnya offerings. Not only that, Sarva Loka Maheshwaram, he is the supreme controller of all the planets of all the universes. We are living in one universe, but ours is not the only universe. There are millions of universes, unlimited number of universes in the material manifestation. The Lord Vishnu or Krishna is the supreme controller of all of them. So Krishna is such a great personality. Everything belongs to him. All the universes belong to him. Everything that we have in this world belongs to him. All the gold, all the diamond, all the riches, all the natural resources, everything belongs to him. The whole planet itself belongs to him. The entire solar system, the Milky Way Galaxy, everything belongs to Krishna.

### Krishna's Expectations, Love and Devotion, Simple Offerings

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Whatever bhakti upasrutam, whatever with love you give me, I am ready to accept."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna values love and devotion above material possessions, accepting even simple offerings like water, a leaf, a fruit, or a flower.

So Krishna is such a great person. He is such a great personality. But then Krishna, what is he expecting from all of us? Although he is such a great personality, he is not expecting something big from us. Normally if we have to go, if we have an appointment with a big person, let us say we have an appointment with the president of the country and we are going to meet him, then how will we go? We will not go empty handed. We will take some gift or some present for him. Now what will we take as a gift or present? I tell you, you are going to this one. You come and ask me that you have got an appointment with the president of India. So what do you think you should take as a gift for the president? So I respond, why don't you take one bottle of mineral water? What will you say? You laugh at me. What are you talking? I am going to meet the president, not my some chaddi those living next door. Can I take a bottle of water and go to him? That's all. You know, the whole meeting will be a fiasco. Okay. So I have to take something valuable, something which will be of some value to him. So this will be your response. Now imagine you have got an appointment with the Supreme Lord Krishna, who is the proprietor of all the universe, the entire planetary system, everything belongs to him. You are going to meet him. So what gift can you take to him? So Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita what he expects from us. Krishna is ready to give his time to all of us, to meet us, to hear us, to hear all our prayers. Everything, Krishna is ready. So but then when we go to Krishna, we cannot go empty handed. We have to take something. So Krishna is telling in the Bhagavad Gita what all we can give him. Krishna is saying patram pushpam phalam toyam yomye bhaktya prayatchati tadaham bhakti upasrutam asnami prayatatmanah. Krishna says, bhakti upasrutam, whatever with love you give me, I am ready to accept. Okay, what should I offer you with love? You offer me a glass of water, a leaf, a fruit or a flower, I am happy with that. You can see Krishna is pleased even if you offer him one glass of water. Even that Krishna is looking forward. Krishna does not need water. What is? He is the owner of the whole universe. What is the need for him? Even if we take the most precious diamonds and jewels and go to Krishna, it is nothing, it is like garbage for him because everything belongs to him. What can we offer to him? But still Krishna is saying, what I see is your love and affection. So if you give me even a glass of water with love and affection, I will happily accept.

### Krishna's Love, Duryodhana's Plot, Durvasa Muni

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "So similarly Krishna, we are all Krishna's children. And Krishna is excited. He is happy. He is expecting our love and affection, nothing more, nothing less."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a president and his grandchild to illustrate Krishna's desire for love and affection, then returns to the story of Duryodhana and his plan to use Durvasa Muni against the Pandavas.

Just like if the president were to go to his home and his grandchild comes to him and offers him a glass of water with so much love and affection, so the president will feel very very grateful to his grandchild, oh so nice, my dear child you have brought me a glass of water, we will very happily he will drink the water. Actually president does not need water, what is one glass of water for him? But then when he sees his grandchild giving that glass of water with love and affection, he feels highly satisfied. So similarly Krishna, we are all Krishna's children. And Krishna is excited. He is happy. He is expecting our love and affection, nothing more, nothing less. So this is Krishna's nature, he is very humble and very down to earth and he has very little expectations from us. All that he is looking forward from us is our love and affection, that's all. This is Krishna's nature. So coming back to our original narration. Now it so happened that the sage Krishna, he was very happy. The sage who had come to Hastinapura was none other than the powerful Durvasamuni. Now Durvasamuni, as you all know, his nature is that he is very short tempered. Now the moment Duryodhana heard that Durvasamuni has come to Hastinapura, immediately something clicked in his mind. He thought, ah, now if somehow I can make Durvasamuni go to the Pandavas and the Pandavas are not able to take care of him, then Durvasamuni will definitely get angry and he will curse them. So my military power cannot match the Pandavas' military power, but definitely a Brahmana's power, his power of his austerity, his tapasya, the Pandavas cannot counter. So this will be a good way to take revenge on the Pandavas.

### Duryodhana's Service, Durvasa Muni's Temperament, Manipulation

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana swallowed all the problems he had to face in front of Durvasamuni and very humbly he served him."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Duryodhana's elaborate and humble service to Durvasa Muni, despite the sage's difficult temperament, all in pursuit of his plan to harm the Pandavas.

So thinking like this, Duryodhana immediately invited Durvasamuni to the palace and Durvasamuni, when he comes, he comes with all his disciples. And now Durvasamuni's disciples are not one or two or three or five or ten, not even hundred, not even a thousand, ten thousand disciples. So you can imagine, Duryodhana had to make all the arrangements to take care of all of them, take care of their accommodation, their food and whatever other requirements are there. And over and above that, Durvasa himself has to be taken care of. So Duryodhana made all the necessary arrangements, made very good preparations. He took care of them and he personally attended to Durvasamuni. And this Durvasamuni was a very difficult customer. Suddenly in the middle of the night, he will wake up and he will say, you know, I want to offer something to my Deity, so my Salagrama, so you please bring varieties of preparation. And immediately the people will run, they will cook something and then after 45 minutes, one hour, they will bring all their offerings. They will, Durvasamuni will say, no, no, I changed my mind. I don't want to offer anything. Take back everything. You know, like that. He was quite a difficult customer like that. So and no matter how much good care would be taken of him, he would find some fault or the other and he would get angry and he would criticize, he would chastise, all these things would go on. But Duryodhana, although he was such an arrogant person, keeping in mind that he had to take the help of Durvasamuni to humiliate his archenemy, the Pandavas, he did not do it. Duryodhana swallowed all the problems he had to face in front of Durvasamuni and very humbly he served him. He took good care of him. No complaints, whatever Durvasamuni demanded, everything he would run around and try to satisfy him in every possible way. This went on for some days. After a few days, then Durvasamuni was very satisfied with the way Duryodhana had served him. Of course, Durvasamuni was a very simple sage. Although he was a very simple sage, he was a little short-tempered, but he was very good at heart and he would very easily get pleased also because Durvasamuni is a partial incarnation of Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva also has this same characteristic, he has the same trait. He gets pleased very quickly and he gets displeased also very quickly. So this Durvasamuni was very pleased with Duryodhana's way of hospitality and without any complaints, without any objections, Duryodhana had served him. So finally, Durvasamuni was very pleased with him and he told Duryodhana, I am very happy with the way you have served me. So I bless you. And like this, he gave his blessings and all that.

### Duryodhana's Manipulation, Blessings, Pandavas

**Key Quote:** "I want that you should give your blessings to them also. Give them also an opportunity to serve you."
**Summary:** Duryodhana subtly manipulates Durvasa Muni into visiting the Pandavas in the forest, framing it as an opportunity for them to receive blessings.

Then Duryodhana replied to Durvasamuni. He wanted to manipulate Durvasamuni and, but at the same time, he could not openly do it also because Durvasamuni, after all, he is a good sage. And why would he get angry? He was angry on the Pandavas for no reason. There had to be some reason. So Duryodhana told Durvasamuni that Durvasamuni, I am very happy that you have blessed me. I am very fortunate to have received your, the dust of your feet on my kingdom, in my palace and to have received the opportunity to serve you. Now I have a humble request to you. My brothers, the Pandavas are in the forest. I want that you should give your blessings to them also. Give them also an opportunity to serve you. By this way, let them also get the fortune. Why I should alone be the recipient of the fortune of serving you? They should also get the opportunity. Durvasamuni was very happy when he heard this because the Pandavas are dear to everyone. In fact, another name for Yudhishthira Maharaj was Ajatashatru, meaning one whose enemy had never been born. In other words, he would, by his actions, by his words and by his deeds, he would never create a situation where another person could become inimical towards him. Of course Duryodhana considered the Pandavas and Yudhishthira Maharaj his own enemies. That was because of his envy, not because Yudhishthira Maharaj had mistreated him at any point of time. So naturally because Yudhishthira Maharaj was such a great personality and he was always fixed in virtue, so all the rishis and sages held in this person to be in their arrangements. The Pandavas and Yudhishthira Maharaj always people in virtue. That was the common point that he held on. So, naturally when a person atmospheric, they thought that Yudhishthira Maharaj would be seen him in high esteem. So, Durvasamuni also held him in high esteem. So, now, when he heard from Duryodhana that the Pandavas are there in Dwaitavana and he can go and give them an opportunity to serve him and he can bless them, Durvasamuni was very happy. He said, oh yes, why not, definitely I will go and visit them. Now, Duryodhana started putting

his plan into motion. He said, Durvasamuni, I have heard that Yudhishthir Maharaj is conducting various sacrifices, Ejnas and all that. So, if you go to him during the day time, in the first half of the day, he may be busy in his Ejnas and all that. So, he may not be able to receive you properly and take good care of you. So, after he finishes his Ejna and then he has fed all the people who have come to the Ejna and then all the Pandavas have had their food, then you can go to him. So, he will also be free. He can give you exclusive attention and he will be able to take care of you in a very nice manner. So, when Durvasamuni heard this from Duryodhana, he said, okay, what you are saying also makes sense. If I go with my 10,000 disciples, if I barge into his Ejna, it is not good, it is not correct also. So, after they have had their food and sent away all their other guests, then I will go. I can spend some good time personally also with them. So, I will do as you say. It is a good service. So, this is the suggestion you are given. Poor Durvasamuni, he had fallen into

the trap of Duryodhana unknowingly. Now, Durvasamuni took all his disciples, 10,000 disciples and he proceeded to Dwaitavana and he reached Dwaitavana. When he reached Dwaitavana, he reached at a time after lunch time when the Pandavas had completely finished all their fire sacrifices, all the guests had been fed, they themselves had taken their food. And now, Durvasamuni entered the ashrama, the hermitage where the Pandavas were living and he came and knocked on the door. When he knocked on the door, the Pandavas came. They opened the door and they saw, oh, Durvasamuni has come with all his disciples. They immediately offered their obeisances and welcomed him and Durvasamuni said, oh, my dear Pandavas, I come here. I heard that you are here. So, I come to meet all of you. So, I have come a long distance. I am a little hungry. I will go and take my bath. I will take my bath and come. After that, I will have food at your place. Now the Pandavas said, okay, okay, Durvasamuni, we will wait for you to come back and Bhima took them and showed them a place close by where there was a water body where they could take bath and freshen up. So, Durvasamuni with all his 10,000 disciples went to the water body and they started taking bath. In the meantime, here what was happening? Yudhishthir Maharaj went back into the cottage and told Draupadi, Oh, this Durvasamuni has come with his 10,000 disciples. Now we have to feed him. He is hungry. So please bring out all your pots and from your Akshaya Patra, please start serving him. Because the Akshaya Patra can serve unlimited number of meals. Draupadi stood there stunned. She said, I cannot feed him now. Yudhisthira Maharaj asked her, why? What happened? She said, I already have my food and once I have had my food, the Akshaya Patra will become empty. It is totally empty. Nothing is there here. So can you cook something now for 10,000 people? What? It is not like cooking for one or two people. Even for one or two people, if you have to cook, you need at least half an hour, one hour. And this Durvasamuni will finish all his bath and come back in 10-15 minutes. 10,000 people, where will I cook from? How will I cook? Not possible.

**Key Quote:** "Now the Yudhishthira Maharaj was in great anxiety that now the rules of Dharma will be broken."
**Summary:** The Pandavas are in a state of anxiety, fearing they will break the principles of Dharma by failing to provide hospitality to Durvasa Muni and his disciples, ending on a cliffhanger.

Now what to do? Now the Pandavas were in great anxiety. Now if they don't take care of Durvasamuni, they were not so much worried about his anger. They were more worried that the principles of Dharma will be broken. They would not be able to take care of a guest who had come to their place seeking food. So it is the duty of a Kshatriya and a Grihastha that whoever comes to their house, they should feed them amply. Even if the owner of the house, even if the host says, he has not eaten, even if he goes hungry, he should still take care of feeding the guest. This is the principle of Dharma. Now the Yudhishthira Maharaj was in great anxiety that now the rules of Dharma will be broken. Now what to do? Draupadi is a woman, so she also got into great anxiety. She was not able to tolerate. She started crying. Now what to do? The Pandavas were not able to understand what to do. In the meantime, the Durvasa Muni along with all his 10,000 disciples, they were all taking bath and they had finished their bath and they were about to come out of the water body and dry themselves and wear their cloth. They were on the verge of finishing their bath. So now what could the Pandavas do in this scenario? How could they save themselves from the wrath of Durvasa Muni, which was impending, which it looked like it was a mission impossible to be able to feed. How could the Pandavas save themselves from the wrath of Durvasa Muni with his 10,000 disciples? Now the Pandavas were really stuck. So what could they do now in this situation? Please join us in our next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna. Jagatguru Srila Prabhupada Ki Jai.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, setting the stage for the current narrative about Durvasa Muni's visit and the Pandavas' predicament.

Hare Krishna and a warm welcome to all of you to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode, we have seen how Durvasamuni had come to the hermitage of the Pandavas with his 10,000 disciples at a time when Draupadi had finished her meal. And Durvasamuni came there at that time specifically because Duryodhana had manipulated him into thinking that that would be the right time to come to the Pandavas, when they would be free enough to receive him and his disciples well. Durvasamuni's intentions were not bad, but he had been manipulated by Duryodhana, unaware of Duryodhana's nefarious design. And when Durvasamuni came, he requested Yudhishthira Maharaj to keep lunch ready for all of them and that they would finish their noon bath and come back. And they went to the place, to a water body nearby where they could take bath. In the meantime, we saw how Draupadi and the Pandavas were all very anxious about what they could do now because to cook for 10,000 people in a matter of few minutes was practically impossible. So what did the Pandavas do? What happened to them? Would Durvasamuni's ire vent itself upon them?

### Krishna, Narada Muni, Dwaraka, Opulence, Manifestation

**Key Quote:** "Like this narada mani went from palace to palace in every palace he saw krishna was personally present and engaged in some activity or the other"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates an incident in Dwaraka where Narada Muni witnesses Krishna's simultaneous presence in multiple palaces, highlighting Krishna's supreme nature.

We will begin today's episode with a small incident which happened in Dwaraka. Once Naradamuni, wishing to have darshan of Lord Krishna, because Naradamuni is a great devotee of Lord Krishna, he came to Dwaraka. Now when he came to Dwaraka, he saw that Dwaraka city was very opulent. And he found that there were 16,108 palaces, which Krishna had built for his queens, who also equally were equal in number to the palaces. Naradamuni thought, where will I find Krishna? So he randomly entered into one of the palaces. When he entered into the palace, Krishna was with one of his queens, playing with his children and Krishna very warmly welcomed Naradamuni, asked him about his well-being, etc. And then Naradamuni convinced Krishna to come to Dwaraka, to the palace and see what's happening there because Krishna is having 16,108. How is he managing all of them? We know how in this world today for one man is to manage one wife, he is, you know, his whole world will turn upside down. Now imagine not one, Krishna has sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives to manage. So Narada Muni, being curious to know about this, he entered into another palace. There he saw Krishna was engaged in conducting some fire sacrifice, just like the yajnas are compulsory for every grahastha to be performed in the Vedic varnasama system. So because while walking, while drinking water, while breathing, while doing all these activities, we unknowingly commit sinful activities by stepping upon insects like ants, etc., and we cause deaths to them which actually accrue sinful reactions to us. Not only that, in the course of our earning our wealth, there will be some lies that we may have to speak, or they may be harmless lies, just like you go to a nearby kirana shop to buy your groceries and when you go there you ask him, ask the dhukandar, the owner of the shop, you ask him what is the cost of the dal. He will tell you the dal is 95 rupees per kg. You will say why it is so high. Then he will say no, for you at cost price I will give you 93 rupees. So you will also feel very happy, okay, two rupees discount and you will buy it. But you also know, shopkeeper also knows he cannot give it at cost price. If he starts selling his boots at cost price then he will heavily manage his family. So to just to give you a mental satisfaction he says for you I'm giving it at cost price. So this is a harmless life, but nevertheless it is still alive. Like this in earning our wealth we sometimes have to partake of sinful means to earn our livelihood. So in this many many ways we keep committing sins inadvertently although we may never intend to commit any sinful act. Therefore the Veda state every grahastha has to perform yajna to free himself of his of the sinful reactions which are accruing to him. Not only he has to do dana and he has to do tapasya, meaning he has to engage in fire sacrifice to please Lord Vishnu, he has to engage in activities of charity and he has to undertake some vrata, some austerities. These are compulsory for everyone. Charity was an obligation, it was not a choice. So Krishna, when Narada Muni came to this particular palace of Krishna, Krishna was engaged in doing some yajna. So then Narada Muni left that palace and entered another palace and there he saw Krishna was giving away cows in charity to some qualified brahmanas and he went to another palace. There he saw Krishna was engaged in advising his sons about the duality of this material nature and how we have to progress spiritually. Like this Narada Muni went from palace to palace. In every palace he saw Krishna was personally present and engaged in some activity or the other. So when Narada Muni saw this he was astounded. He was astounded because Krishna was personally present in each of those palaces individually. These were not illusory forms, they were Krishna himself.

**Key Quote:** "But Krishna can be present in multiple places at the same time and still he remains the individual that he is."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's unique ability to be present in multiple places simultaneously, emphasizing his supremacy and transcendence of limitations.

We limited conditioned souls, we can be present in one location at one time. We cannot be in two places at the same time. But Krishna can be present in multiple places at the same time and still he remains the individual that he is. All of these 16,108 Krishnas who were there in each of those palaces, they were not illusory forms, they were not magical forms, they were actually Krishna himself. So this incident demonstrates the supremacy of Krishna, that Krishna is not an ordinary person.

**Key Quote:** "That Krishna who was in Dwaraka with Rukmini Devi, he heard Draupadi's prayer and he immediately rushed out of his room"
**Summary:** The speaker transitions back to the Pandavas' story, describing how Draupadi's desperate prayer to Krishna in the forest prompts Krishna to immediately appear and offer assistance.

So Krishna once, he was in one of his palaces with Rukmini Devi. Rukmini Devi is the principal queen of Krishna. So he was there. He was in his personal room and he was resting on his bed along with Rukmini Devi. Suddenly, at that moment, Krishna got up and he rushed out of the room. Why did Krishna rush out of the room? Because what had happened at that moment, the Pandavas who were there in the forest, when they saw that they were in great danger of transgressing Dharma by not being able to feed Durvasamuni who had come to their hermitage seeking some food, Draupadi, not knowing what to do, she started calling out to Krishna. Krishna, Govinda, what to do? You only have to, you are my only protector. You only have to protect me. Now this prayer of Draupadi, she submitted her prayer with so much surrender and dependence on Krishna, that Krishna who was in Dwaraka with Rukmini Devi, he heard Draupadi's prayer and he immediately rushed out of his room and although he was in Dwaraka, Gujarat, and the Pandavas were in somewhere near Uttar Pradesh, but still Krishna, within a few seconds, he appeared at the hermitage of the Pandavas. And then Krishna came and knocked on the door. And then the Pandavas came and they opened the door and they saw, oh, Krishna is here. And they immediately welcomed Krishna because Krishna is their dear friend. So they immediately welcomed him, brought him into the room and now their anxiety doubled because until now there was only one guest to deal with, Durvasamuni and his 10,000 disciples. Now Krishna himself has come. So immediately the Pandavas made him sit comfortably and then Krishna said, Yes, Draupadi, you called me. That's why I came. Then Draupadi narrated to him what all had happened and like this Durvasamuni was waiting for his food and she had already had her food. So the Akshaya Patra which could produce unlimited food was now empty.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna becomes completely satisfied when his devotee offers him something with love and affection."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates how Krishna, despite the dire situation, asks for food and is satisfied by the small offering of leftover sabji from Draupadi, emphasizing the importance of devotion over material offerings.

Now Krishna said, Okay, we'll think about that later. We'll figure out some solution. I'm very hungry. I came all the way from Dwaraka. I've come a long way. I'm very hungry. Give me something to eat first. You know, in an empty stomach your mind doesn't work. So Krishna said, First you bring me something to eat. Then we'll think of some solution. So Draupadi immediately rushed back to the kitchen and then she started searching. Oh, Krishna is hungry. She forgot about Durvasamuni, 10,000 disciples, all that because Krishna was their Supreme Lord, her most lovable object. Krishna being the Supreme Lord is the most lovable object for all living entities. So Draupadi thought, you know, she went into greater anxiety. Oh, Krishna is hungry. I have to feed him something. Then she searched around. Nothing was there. And she came back to the room with an empty pot, her eyes full of tears. Krishna, what to do? You're hungry. See, all the pots are empty. There is nothing. She was totally, she was very, very sad and disappointed that she could not feed Krishna. Krishna is hungry and not able to feed him. Then Krishna said, something will be there in the pot you have served. Something may be there. Then Draupadi again looked into the pot very carefully and she found little sabji was sticking in the pot. She wiped the bottom of the pot and took out and said, Krishna, this is all that is there. I am so sorry. This is all that I can offer you. With so much affection, with so much love, Draupadi offered it to Krishna. And like we saw in the last session, what does Krishna expect from us? Even one glass of water, if it is offered with love, Krishna is ready to offer. On the other hand, if we offer the most valuable thing, the most precious jewel and all the wealth in the world, if we are offered the lotus feet of Krishna without any love for him, Krishna is not interested. So when Draupadi gave with so much love and affection, Krishna immediately took that little sabji which was left over and he tasted it and said, he tasted it and he ate it. So like Krishna said, like we discussed in the last episode also, Krishna becomes completely satisfied when his devotee offers him something with love and affection. So although it was a very small quantity of sabji that was there, because Draupadi offered it with full love and affection and surrender, Krishna ate that and he felt completely satisfied. He is satisfied not by the food, but by the devotion with which it is offered.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna rescued the Pandavas from the danger of of Durvasamuni's anger and curse"
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Krishna instructs Sahadeva to call Durvasa Muni, and miraculously, Durvasa and his disciples suddenly feel full and decide to leave, relieving the Pandavas from a potentially disastrous situation.

Krishna said, I am so satisfied with the food that you have given me. So now the Pandavas were happy that Krishna is satisfied, at least we managed to satisfy Krishna. But then, the Durvasamuni's anxiety came back to them. And this Durvasamuni, how to feed Durvasamuni and his 10,000 disciples, that anxiety again was haunting them. So then the Pandavas said, now Krishna, you only have to rescue us, please tell us what to do. Then Krishna told Sahadeva, okay, you go and call Durvasamuni. The Pandavas were looking at each other and said, calling Durvasamuni, what will we do, call him and do? We have got nothing here. So Krishna said, no, don't worry, go and call him, no, let him come, after that we will deal with him, I will tell you what to do. Okay, Sahadeva said, and he went to the edge of the place, where the water body was, he did not want to immediately go and interrupt, all Durvasamuni's disciples, they would all be taking bath, he did not want to interrupt in their privacy, so he stepped a little, a little distance away, and he called out, oh Durvasamuni, we are waiting for you, please come for your lunch, to Yudhishthira Maharaj's hermitage. Now Durvasamuni and his disciples, they got out of the water, they had finished their bath, and they had cleaned themselves, and they were putting on their clothes, when they heard this call, then they started looking at each other's face, one of the disciples walked up to Durvasamuni, and he told him, Durvasamuni, my stomach is feeling very full, I am not hungry, so if I come with all of you, and all of you are eating, and I don't eat, it looks very bad, so all of you come, I will not come, then one by one, all the other disciples also started joining, that, no, no, no, I also don't want to come, my stomach is also full, my stomach is also full, basically every one of them, their stomach is full, none of them want to go, then Durvasamuni looked at them, and he was saying, I am also, my stomach is also full, I also don't feel like going, now we told Yudhishthir Maharaj, that we all have come, prepare the food, now he is calling us for food, and if we go there, and none of us eat something, nothing, if we don't eat anything, what will be, it will be a great insult to them, and God alone knows what will happen, we will have to face their anger on the earth, and who is going to face Bhima, if he gets angry, so what should we do, so they were looking at each other, then they all consulted amongst themselves, and they decided now, if we go back to the Pandavas hermitage, we will have to, it will be very embarrassing, we will go there, and we will say, we told you to prepare food, but now we are not interested in taking, it looked very bad, it will be very humiliating, very embarrassing, and this is the forest, all sages are there, news will spread, and people will start making fun of us, so, what to do now, better we silently go away from here, so they immediately picked up all their clothes, and whatever little belongings they had, they were all sages, and engaged in various austerities, so they did not have much belongings, so they picked up whatever they had, silently, they ran away from the place.

**Key Quote:** "What exactly caused the Durvasamuni and his disciples to lose their hunger"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes the episode by highlighting the mysterious nature of Durvasa Muni and his disciples suddenly losing their hunger after bathing, setting up the next episode to explore the reason behind this event.

Now Sahadeva is calling, calling, no reply is coming, so he thought, let me see what happened, and he goes and sees there, nothing is there, and he could see that, all the disciples had come there, and they had taken their bath, and all that, and he is looking here and there, and nobody, he could not find even one soul, so Sahadeva went back to the hermitage, and he told all the Pandavas, I went there to the water body, I am searching for Durvasamuni and his disciples, not able to find them anywhere, so then Krishna started smiling, and he said, okay, Durvasamuni must have left, maybe he had some other work, so the Pandavas started talking to him, and said, oh, maybe, Durvasamuni, you know, he keeps changing his decisions very frequently, not very stable in his decisions, suddenly he must have remembered some other work, and he must have gone away, anyway, what a relief for us, we were saved from the great disaster of inviting a sage, and not feeding him properly, and so like this, Krishna rescued the Pandavas from the danger of Durvasamuni's anger and curse. So, now the interesting point is, that, why did Durvasamuni and his 10,000 disciples, who were actually hungry when they came to the hermitage, after taking their bath in that water body, why did they feel that their stomachs were full, because normally, in our experience, if we are hungry, and if we take a bath, our hunger will increase, our appetite will increase, in fact, if we are not feeling so hungry, also, we take a bath, our appetite will increase, and if you go and take bath in a water body, like a river, or stream, or something like that, fresh water body, your appetite will increase even more. So, in the case of Durvasamuni and his disciples, when they went and took bath, they should have, their hunger should have increased, the intensity of their hunger should have increased, but we saw, the rewards happened, and it's not that it happened with one or two people, all the 10,000 people, all the 10,000 of them, including Durvasamuni, felt the same thing. So, what could be the reason for this? This is not an ordinary incident, there is something really mysterious behind this. So, what exactly caused Durvasamuni and his disciples to lose their hunger, please join us in our next episode.

**Key Quote:** "being captivated by the beauty of Draupadi, he tried to forcibly abduct her while the Pandavas were not there in the forest at that time."
**Summary:** Recap of Jaidratha's abduction of Draupadi and the Pandavas' absence.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to today's episode of the Mahabharata. Last time we have seen how the ruler of Sindhu, the Sindhu Raja, Jaidratha, who was also known as Saindava, was the husband of Dushyala, the youngest sister of Mahabharata. He came across, he happened to be going to the kingdom of Shalva for an alliance, for a marriage and along the way he happened to pass through the forest where the Pandavas were staying and being captivated by the beauty of Draupadi, he tried to forcibly abduct her while the Pandavas were not there in the forest at that time. Now what happened to Draupadi? When Jaidratha came to their hermitage and he abducted Draupadi, the Pandavas were in the forest. They were not in the hermitage at that point of time. When the Pandavas returned to the hermitage, they found the maidservant of Draupadi, Dhatraika, lying on the floor and weeping inconsolably. The Pandavas quickly approached her and they understood that something was amiss. And when they looked around, they could not find Draupadi also. Then this maidservant, Dhatraika, informed the Pandavas how the king Jaidratha had come there, and against her wishes, Draupadi was forcibly abducted by Jaidratha. Dhatraika also informed the Pandavas the direction in which Jaidratha, along with his retinue of the few soldiers, of that small bit of army that he had brought along with him, which direction they had gone into.

**Key Quote:** "Get ready to face your death."
**Summary:** The Pandavas pursue Jaidratha, who arrogantly underestimates their power.

That was also pointed out by Dhatraika. Immediately, the Pandavas, they had their chariots and their horses and all that. They immediately set out in pursuit of Jaidratha. While pursuing Jaidratha, after a little while, they came across Dhaumya Rishi. This Dhaumya, he was the family priest of the Pandavas. And he also happened to be near the hermitage of the Pandavas, when Jaidratha had abducted Draupadi. And when Dhaumya saw Jaidratha kidnapping Draupadi, he vehemently protested, and he beseeched Jaidratha not to do such an evil thing and to set Draupadi free. But this Jaidratha was an evil person. He did not heed anything of what Dhaumya said. After following Jaidratha for some distance and trying to convince him to release Draupadi, when Dhaumya saw that it was not possible for him, that Jaidratha was not listening, so he was left behind by Jaidratha and he had gone forward. So this Dhaumya Rishi again related to the Pandavas what had happened and how he was also a witness to Jaidratha forcibly abducting Draupadi and how he had tried his best to stop Jaidratha but he would not listen to him. And Dhaumya again showed the Pandavas in which direction Jaidratha had gone. So now the Pandavas very quickly pursued the direction in which Jaidratha had gone and very soon they caught up with him. And Jaidratha could see from the distance the Pandavas coming forward. So Jaidratha asked Draupadi that who are these people who are coming? And Draupadi replied that these people are my five husbands, the Pandavas, whom even the Devatas cannot face in battle. Get ready to face your death. So Jaidratha said, after all five of them, I got an army of a few thousand people with me, what they will be able to withstand? Let us see. One hand I will also see. Let us see. And Jaidratha was also very arrogant and he thought, you know, I will see what these people can do.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, do not kill him. Do not take his life. Only teach him a lesson. That's good enough."
**Summary:** The Pandavas defeat Jaidratha's army, and Yudhishthira instructs them not to kill him because he is married to their sister.

And quickly when the Pandavas came, Jaidratha sent forth his army and the army of Jaidratha fell upon the Pandavas. A few thousand soldiers on one side and only the five Pandavas on the other. But the Pandavas were no ordinary people. Each of them was capable of fighting thousands of soldiers single-handedly. And so Yudhishthira Maharaj, he killed a few of the few hundred soldiers. Bhima killed a few other hundred soldiers. Arjuna also took care of a few hundred of them, Nakula also, Sahadeva also. And very quickly, in no time, Jaidratha saw that his whole army was completely vanquished. There was hardly anything left. And whatever little few people were surviving, they all ran away. And now Jaidratha is all alone. So Jaidratha realized, I had underestimated the strength of the Pandavas. So he thought, now, you know, Jaidratha, although he had on the spur of the moment, he had abducted Draupadi thinking that the Pandavas would be no match for him, at heart, actually, he was a very big coward. So when he saw that his whole army was finished, and he was all alone standing in front of these five Pandava brothers, he left Draupadi there, and he quickly took his chariot and started, you know, fleeing from the spot. So the Pandavas, now that they had dispersed the entire army, they quickly caught up with Draupadi. And the Pandavas inquired whether she was all right. And then Bhima and Arjuna told Yudhishthir Maharaj, that Maharaj, you please take Draupadi back safely to the hermitage. Nakula and Sahadeva will accompany you. We both will see to this Jaidratha. So then Yudhishthir Maharaj said, okay, I will take Draupadi with me. And then Yudhishthir Maharaj told Bhima, but please be careful. He is the husband of our sister Dushala. Therefore, do not kill him. Do not take his life. Only teach him a lesson. That's good enough.

**Key Quote:** "For a Kshatriya to set his eyes upon a married woman was a strict no-no. It was a forbidden thing."
**Summary:** Discussion of Kshatriya dharma, highlighting Jaidratha's cowardice and violation of ethical codes by abducting a married woman.

So Arjuna and Bhima continued in pursuit of Jaidratha. And Yudhishthira, Nakula, Sahadeva along with Draupadi, they returned to the hermitage. Now by the time the Pandavas had got back Draupadi, inquired about her welfare and sent her back along with Yudhishthira, Nakula and Sahadeva to the hermitage, by then, at great speed, Jaidratha had already crossed couple of miles beyond the Pandavas. So Jaidratha had got a head start. Now how to catch up with him? So Arjuna sent forth a few arrows in the direction where Jaidratha had gone. And those arrows quickly covered all the couple of miles which Jaidratha had already passed by and they went and killed Jaidratha's horses. So now Jaidratha was left without a chariot, so he started running away on foot. So when he was running on foot, Arjuna and Bhima on their chariots very quickly caught up with Jaidratha. And so they saw Jaidratha is running away. And behind him, Arjuna and Bhima are coming. And Bhima started calling out, Hey Jaidratha, where are you running? Stop! Wait! Stand there and fight with us! Jaidratha was in no mood to turn around. He simply kept running. Actually a Kshatriya is never supposed to run away from battle. And especially when he is challenged, he cannot turn away like that. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, the character, real character of a real Kshatriya is Yuddhe Chaapalaayanam. In a battlefield, even if he is facing death, the Kshatriya, the true Kshatriya will never turn back. But Jaidratha was a Kshatriya in name only. He was actually a big coward. He was not qualified to be a Kshatriya. Kshatriya, the meaning of the word Kshatriya is one who protects his citizens from any kind of harm. He is called a Kshatriya. It was the duty of the Kshatriya to protect the citizens, bodily also and their honor also. A Kshatriya is always supposed to give special protection. Although generally the Kshatriya is supposed to give protection to the citizens, the Kshatriya has to give special protection to the children, to the women and to the elderly people and to the cows. These four were required to be given special protection by the Kshatriyas. Kshatriyas would sometimes abduct some girls with the intention of marrying them. But such girls would be unmarried girls and the intention in abducting them would be to marry them, not with any other evil intention. For a Kshatriya to set his eyes upon a married woman was a strict no-no. It was a forbidden thing. A Kshatriya could abduct an unmarried girl and marry her, but he could never set his eyes upon a woman he was already married. Draupadi was a well-married woman. She had children of her own. And Jayadratha was knowing this very well. And even though she expressed that she had no interest in Jayadratha, still Jayadratha abducted her. So this is completely against the codes of Kshatriya Dharma.

**Key Quote:** "By abducting Draupadi, Jayadratha had become an Atatain, an aggressor."
**Summary:** Jaidratha is labeled an 'Atatain' (aggressor), and Bhima's anger is discussed, along with Arjuna's intervention to prevent him from killing Jaidratha.

Now this Jayadratha, actually by trying to abduct the Pandavas wife, he had become an Atatain. In the Vedic terminology, there are kinds of Atatains or aggressors. A person who encroaches upon one's property, a person who administers poison, a person who abducts one's wife, a person who suddenly attacks one with deadly weapons without any prior notice. So all these kind of people are called Atatains or aggressors. And in the Vedas it is said that if somebody is an aggressor, is identified as an Atatain, then the person, the victim who is there, if he kills that Atatain, that aggressor, then there is no sin incurred in that. Even in the modern days we can say, we can see that the law will take a very lenient view if a man kills another man in self-defense. This is somewhat similar to that. But of course the Vedas were very specific and they had delineated the seven kinds of people in killing whom nobody could incur a sin and the king also could not punish such people. By abducting Draupadi, Jayadratha had become an Atatain, an aggressor. And according to the codes of Dharma, he was liable to be killed. So now Arjuna and Bhima, when they saw that Jayadratha is not turning around and he is not standing there for a battle, they pursued him and finally very quickly caught up with him. And when they caught up with him, Jayadratha was in no mood to fight. He was already shaking. All his limbs, his whole body was shivering. But then Bhima was very angry. He had to vent his anger. So he started knocking around Jayadratha like he was some piece of doll. So he started punching him, he started kicking him and after some time this Jayadratha, just by Bhima's use of fists and his knees, Jayadratha practically was almost dead. Then Arjuna quickly reminded Bhima, Bhima, please remember Yudhishthira Maharaj has told us not to kill him. He is after all the husband of our sister Dushyala. She should not become a widow. So please don't kill him. Bhima was reminded by Arjuna and then finally he pulled himself back. Bhima's anger was so much that he would not have stopped himself. But somehow Arjuna managed to remind Bhima and then Bhima also controlled,

**Summary:** Bhima humiliates Jaidratha by shaving his head, and Jaidratha is forced to accept subordination to Yudhishthira, but secretly plans revenge through austerities.

he restrained himself. And then now you know Bhima's anger somehow he tried to come out. So what he did, he shaved off the head of Jayadratha except for a few clumps of hair here and there, which is a symbolic way of telling the world that this Kshatriya has been captured and humiliated by another Kshatriya. And then Arjuna and Bhima told him, that we are going to spare your life provided you accept that from today you are a subordinate prince to Yudhishthira Maharaj and that you will always obey his commands. Jayadratha had no other alternative. Either he had to lose his life or he had to agree. Jayadratha being the coward he was, he was in no mood to oppose whatever was being said to him. So he decided to kill him. Jayadratha had no other alternative. Either he had to lose his life or he had to oppose whatever was being said. He readily agreed. Then Bhima and Arjuna caught him, caught Jayadratha, took him back to the hermitage and presented him before Yudhishthira Maharaj and Draupadi. And there Jayadratha fell at the feet of Yudhishthira Maharaj and Draupadi, begged forgiveness from them and accepted to be a subordinate king to the Pandavas and he would always obey their command. Like this he accepted. Yudhishthira Maharaj being the very generous and noble person he was, very quickly he forgave Jayadratha and he advised him, please do not do such things. This does not behove you as a king. As a king you should behave in more noble ways and you should protect the citizens. You should not do such things. Like that in many ways nicely Yudhishthira Maharaj advised Jayadratha on the principles of Dharma and Draupadi also forgave him. Okay, some mistake he did. Anyway, after all he is Dushala's husband so she also forgave him. And then the Pandavas released Jayadratha. Now Jayadratha slowly trudged back and as he was going back the humiliation he had suffered he was not able to digest it. Although in front of the Pandavas he had accepted that he was not, he would be subordinate to the Pandavas and he would obey their commands, at heart he had other plans. He wanted to take revenge. Now how to take revenge? Jayadratha was a very, he was a weakling in front of the Pandavas. So what to do now? So he thought the only way is that I have to perform some tapasya, some austerities and I have to please Mahadeva, Lord Shiva and get a benediction from him that I will be able to kill the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Shiva very quickly gives blessings and benedictions to his devotees."
**Summary:** Jaidratha performs tapasya to please Lord Shiva and seek a boon to defeat the Pandavas, setting the stage for the next episode.

Thinking like this, Jayadratha walked and went all the way to Gangotri. He went to Gangotri which is in Uttarakhand and which is in the Himalayas and which is, it is quite a arduous climb to reach to Gangotri. So he went all the way to Gangotri and there he meditated and did tapasya for a long period of time. And after some time Lord Shiva being pleased with his tapasya appeared before Jayadratha. Lord Shiva is Ashutoshya. He is very quickly pleased by people's austerities and Lord Shiva very quickly gives blessings and benedictions to his devotees. Lord Shiva does not think that his benedictions, whether they are harmful or they are for the good of the people. Whatever the people ask, Lord Shiva very quickly and very generously he gives. That's the nature of Lord Shiva. So Jayadratha by his tapasya he managed to please Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva appeared before Jayadratha. And he asked the Jayadratha that O Jayadratha I am pleased with your tapasya. It looks like you are expecting some boon from me. So please ask what you want to. So then Jayadratha folded his hands before Lord Shiva and he said my request is that please grant me a boon that one day I will be able to kill all the five Pandavas in battle. Now when Jayadratha made this request before Lord Shiva, what was Lord Shiva's response? Please join us in our next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today.

**Key Quote:** "In the last episode, we have seen how Jayadratha managed to pacify or please, appease Lord Shiva and he requested from him a benediction by which he could face all the five Pandavas in battle and vanquish them"
**Summary:** The lecture begins with a recap of the previous episode, focusing on Jayadratha's boon from Lord Shiva and the Pandavas' search for firewood leading to Nakula being sent to fetch water.

Hare Krishna, welcome back to all of you to today's episode. In the last episode, we have seen how Jayadratha managed to pacify or please, appease Lord Shiva, and he requested from him a benediction by which he could face all the five Pandavas in battle and vanquish them, which Lord Shiva said is beyond his powers because all the Pandavas were under the direct protection of Lord Krishna, who was the master of Lord Shiva himself. And therefore, Lord Shiva said, the maximum boon that I can grant you is that you can once hold the four Pandavas other than Arjuna at bay only one time in battle. And even that much was enough for Jayadratha, and very satisfyingly, he went back to his kingdom awaiting the day when he would get an opportunity to face the Pandavas in battle and defeat them. In the meantime, we have seen how the Pandavas in search of the firewood which was stolen by a deer went into the forest, and even after pursuing the deer for a long period of time, they could not capture the deer, and being very much aggrieved that they could not recover those Arani firewood sticks which were meant for sacrifice by the sage who was living in the forest, they sat down exhausted in one place in the forest, and Nakula was sent to fetch some water. But when he did not return after a reasonable amount of time, Yudhisthira Maharaj requested Sahadeva to go.

**Key Quote:** "Now Yudhisthira Maharaj was really alarmed. What could have gone wrong? It was highly unthinkable that anything, that any enemy could have attacked and captured Bhima and Arjuna."
**Summary:** The narrative progresses with the successive disappearances of Sahadeva, Arjuna, and Bhima, causing increasing alarm to Yudhisthira, who then decides to investigate himself.

After Sahadeva went, the remaining three Pandavas, they were waiting, and a few minutes elapsed and there was no sign of even Sahadeva. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj started becoming a little worried. Nakula did not come back initially. They were not so worried. They thought maybe he got engrossed in something, forgot to come back or something like that. But when Sahadeva also did not return, Yudhisthira Maharaj was a little worried and he told Arjuna that you please go and see what has happened. Why the two brothers have not returned? Arjuna immediately took his bow just to be well armed in case of any eventuality, and then he went in the direction where Nakula and Sahadeva had gone into the forest in search of water. Yudhisthira and Bhima were waiting, and after a few minutes elapsed, even Arjuna did not return and there was no sign of any signal from him. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj was getting really worried. He told Bhima that I am getting alarmed. Arjuna is such a mighty warrior. Nobody can stand in front of him in battle. Not even the Gandharvas. Not even the Devatas. And it is surprising that Arjuna has not returned. Better you go and see what has happened. Bhima immediately took up his Ghada and he also pursued the three brothers who had gone earlier, Nakula, Sahadeva, as well as Arjuna. And Yudhisthira Maharaj was waiting. Few minutes went by. Now even Bhima has not returned. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj was really alarmed. What could have gone wrong? It was highly unthinkable that anything, that any enemy could have attacked and captured Bhima and Arjuna. It was next to impossible. But something undesirable had happened. This much Yudhisthira Maharaj could be why.

**Summary:** Yudhisthira discovers his brothers lying motionless near a beautiful lake, with no signs of battle or injury, deepening the mystery surrounding their condition.

Therefore he himself set out on foot in the direction in which the rest of his four brothers had gone. After walking a short while in the forest, Yudhisthira Maharaj came across a clearing. And then he saw a little in the distance a beautiful lake with pristine water and filled with lotuses. And there were so many birds surrounding it. There were swans swimming in it. It was a very scenic picture that he was seeing in front of him. And Yudhisthira Maharaj looked around. He could not find anybody. So he went closer to the lake. And when he approached closer to the lake, he suddenly saw on the ground his four brothers lying still, motionless. Yudhisthira Maharaj became very alarmed. And he ran towards the brothers. And he started shaking them, trying to wake them up. All of them were lying motionless with their eyes closed. Practically when Yudhisthira Maharaj tried waking them and tried shaking them and all that, he realized that they were not even breathing. Practically they were dead. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj, then he became very much surprised and astonished that who could have killed his brothers? That too Arjuna and Bhima? Impossible! He looked around and he did not find any signs of any battle, any mud getting, the earth all around being scattered or any such sort of disturbance to the trees or anything like that. Any weapons lying around, arrows lying around here and there. Nothing. He did not find anything. Everything was proper in its place. This made it more surprising. If some enemy had attacked and killed the Pandavas, there should have been some scuffle, some battle. It would have resulted in some destroying some of the foliage. Some weapons would have been lying around. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. And there were no marks of injury on any of the Pandavas.

**Key Quote:** "Yudhisthira Maharaj, I am the owner of this lake. Please do not drink the water of this lake without my permission. If you want to drink the water from this lake, you have to answer my questions."
**Summary:** As Yudhisthira approaches the lake to quench his thirst, he hears a disembodied voice warning him not to drink the water without answering questions, revealing the lake's owner and the fate of his brothers.

This was a real mystery. Yudhisthira Maharaj quickly got up and started looking around. Who could have done this? But he did not find anybody. Now what to do? He was being afflicted by thirst also. So Yudhisthira Maharaj thought, let me drink the water of this lake, refresh myself and then let me investigate what has gone on here. And thinking like this, Yudhisthira Maharaj approached the lake. The moment he was about to take the water and drink, he heard a voice, a disembodied voice. Disembodied because he could not see from where this voice is coming. And this voice, a deep resonant voice, informed Yudhisthira Maharaj. Yudhisthira Maharaj, I am the owner of this lake. Please do not drink the water of this lake without my permission. If you want to drink the water from this lake, you have to answer my questions. If you try to drink the water of this lake without answering my questions, then you will fall dead just like your brothers. I warned all your brothers not to drink the water without answering my questions. But they did not bother. They went ahead and drank the water without answering my questions. And now you look at their face. They have all fallen dead. If you really want to drink the water, please heed my advice, answer my questions. And if you are able to answer my questions correctly, I will grant your permission. Only then you can drink the water. Now Yudhisthira Maharaj looked around and he said, Who are you? How are you able to wield so much power that you are able to kill my brothers? How do I know who you are?

**Summary:** The voice reveals itself to be a Yaksha, a powerful being, who has taken the form of a bird, and Yudhisthira prepares to answer his questions.

Then Yudhisthira Maharaj saw on the banks of that lake, one bird standing there, a crane or some other bird like that. And the crane and that bird said, I am the person who is the owner of this lake. Yudhisthira Maharaj looked disbelievingly at that bird. And he said, I don't believe you are capable of doing this to my brothers. It's impossible. Please reveal yourself. Who are you? Then the bird replied to him, I am an Yaksha. And as a Yaksha, I have taken this form of the bird. So Yakshas are actually living beings who live on higher planets and who are very, very powerful. They are, normally the Yakshas are followers of Kubera. They are far more powerful than the human beings. Now, Yudhisthira Maharaj, understanding that this is a Yaksha, he realized Yakshas can possess superhuman powers. Maybe the Yaksha has really got some fantastic power by which he is able to kill my brothers. Then Yudhisthira Maharaj said, Okay, go ahead. Ask your questions. I am ready to answer them.

**Key Quote:** "What can be more surprising than this? Than the fact that, day after day, living entities are dying, going to the abode of Yamaraj."
**Summary:** The Yaksha begins questioning Yudhisthira on various aspects of Dharma, and Yudhisthira answers satisfactorily, including the most surprising thing in the world: people's illusion of immortality despite witnessing death daily.

Then the Yaksha started asking Yudhisthira Maharaj varieties of questions. Questions on Dharma, questions on virtuosity, righteousness, about the duties of Kshatriyas and all kinds of questions the Yaksha asked Yudhisthira Maharaj. And Yudhisthira Maharaj very satisfactorily answered all of them from the perspective of the Vedas. Finally, the Yaksha told Yudhisthira Maharaj, I am very much satisfied by all your questions. Now, I have got final four questions for you. If you can answer these four also, I will bring back one of your brothers to life. Now, out of these four questions, two questions were very very important. What were these two questions? One question which this Yaksha asked Yudhisthira Maharaj was, Kim Ashtariam, what is the most amazing, surprising thing in this world? To which, Yudhisthira Maharaj replied, What can be more surprising than this? Than the fact that, day after day, living entities are dying, going to the abode of Yamaraj. This is a, this is an established fact. Every day you open the newspaper, there will be an obituary column. And even if that column is a very small representation of the number of people who die. Every day, thousands and lakhs of people die. Every day people are dying. That is not a surprising thing. But what is surprising is, Seshaha, Sthavaramicchanti. Seshaha, those who are surviving, those who are alive, Sthavaramicchanti, they are thinking, I will live forever. My grandfather died, my father died, my uncle died, my brothers died, my friends died, but I am not going to die. I will live forever.

**Key Quote:** "But still, we, whenever somebody dies, we get shocked. Oh, this person died. I cannot believe it. Fact is, every one of us has to die."
**Summary:** Yudhisthira explains that intelligent people understand the temporary nature of life and engage in devotional service to Krishna to escape repeated birth and death.

This is the thinking of people, misguided thinking of the people. Every day people die in accidents, people die out of diseases, people die out of old age, varieties of causes. But still, we, whenever somebody dies, we get shocked. Oh, this person died. I cannot believe it. Fact is, every one of us has to die. But, that is a fact all of us turn a blind eye to. And we always think everybody who is alive will remain alive forever. And I myself will remain alive forever, which is a great illusion. And hence, Yudhishthir Maharaj said, this is the most surprising thing. An intelligent person who has understood this, that life is very temporary, any moment I can die, there is no guarantee to this life. Such an intelligent person will not bother himself about material happiness and material sense gratification, material pursuits. On the other hand, he will take a devotional service to Krishna and try to go back to Godhead where there is no more repeated birth and death. The other important question asked by the Yaksha was, Kimpanthaha, what is the right path for people to follow? To which, Yudhishthir Maharaj replied, We cannot ascertain what is the real path that one has to follow, what is the real goal of life, what is the real purpose of this human form of life. What is the greatest achievement to be aspired for

**Summary:** Yudhisthira explains that the right path cannot be ascertained simply by studying scriptures or using logic due to contradictions and the ever-changing nature of arguments.

in this human form of life. We cannot ascertain this simply by studying scriptures. Why? Because, There are many many scriptures and within the scriptures there are various kinds of contradictory conclusions. If you look at the world, there are many many religious scriptures. You have the Quran, you have the Bible, you have the Torah, you have the Vedas, etc. Now, if you look at the Vedas, within the Vedas itself, the different Puranas, the different Itihasas will give you different conclusions. The Upanishads will give you another kind of conclusion. The Vedanta Sutras will give you another kind of conclusion. So, which is the ultimate conclusion that I am supposed to follow? You cannot understand that simply by studying the scriptures. So, if I cannot understand this by scriptures, I will understand it by logic. Tar ko apratishta. By logic, it is not possible to establish what is the ultimate goal of life. Because, today, I am a good logician. I come up with some logic and everybody appreciates it and everybody praises me and everybody says, yes, wonderful logic. Tomorrow, somebody else will come up who is more intelligent than me and he will counter my logic with another logic of his own. So, logic, it can only lead to arguments. It cannot lead to a conclusion. Hence, logic also fails.

**Key Quote:** "Mahajanoyena gatha sapantaha One has to follow in the footsteps of the Mahajanas."
**Summary:** Yudhisthira states that approaching saintly persons also doesn't guarantee understanding the real conclusion of the Vedas, and the correct path is to follow in the footsteps of the Mahajanas (great authorities).

Then, okay, I will approach some saintly person, some sadhu and I will try to understand from him. Even that does not work. Because, nasavrishir yasya matam na bhinnam The definition of the word muni or rishi is a person who has some sort of opinion which is different from all the others. Nasavrishir, a person cannot be called a rishi or a muni until and unless, matam na bhinnam, until and unless he has a bhinnamata, he has a different opinion about the conclusion of life from all the other rishis and sages. Therefore, simply by approaching any and every sadhu also, it is not possible to understand what is the real conclusion of the Vedas, of the scriptures. Then, what is the kinpantha, what is the path to follow? How does a person understand? What is the right path to follow? Mahajanoyena gatha sapantaha One has to follow in the footsteps of the Mahajanas. Who are these Mahajanas? These Mahajanas are numbered twelve. Twelve Mahajanas are there listed by Yama Raj in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So, these twelve Mahajanas, Yama Raj himself, Brahmaji, Narada Muni, Yasadev, Kapila Muni, and Prahalad Maharaj, Janaka Dev, Bhishma Dev, the four Kumaras, these are all the people who are considered the Mahajanas. These Mahajanas, these twelve Mahajanas, actually know what is the real path of Dharma. Nobody else can ascertain it without following their instructions.

**Key Quote:** "In other words, if we follow the path of Dharma in a gurusishya parampara which is stemming from one of these Mahajanas, then we will be able to understand what is the real goal of life."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of following a guru-shishya parampara (disciplic succession) stemming from one of the twelve Mahajanas to understand the real goal of life.

In other words, if we follow the path of Dharma in a gurusishya parampara which is stemming from one of these Mahajanas, then we will be able to understand what is the real goal of life. If we approach any gurusishya parampara which is not connected to one of these Mahajanas, then one cannot understand what is the real goal of life. For example, there are four sampradayas which are actually bona fide. One is stemming from Brahmaji himself which is called the Brahma sampradaya. And in this sampradaya comes Madhvacharya as well as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and the Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya is also coming from the Brahma sampradaya. Then there is the sampradaya stemming from Lord Shiva which is called the Rudra sampradaya in which Vishnu Swami is the prominent Acharya. Then there is the Sri sampradaya stemming from Lakshmi Devi in which Ramanuja Acharya is the prominent Acharya. Ramanuja Acharya, Yamuna Acharya and many others in that sampradaya. The fourth one is the Kumara sampradaya stemming from the four Kumaras, the Sanath Kumaras who are the four sons of Brahmaji. They are the initiators of another sampradaya. And in this sampradaya, the prominent Acharya is Nimbarka Swami. If we want to understand the real conclusion of the Vedas, one has to be connected to one of these four sampradayas. Otherwise, it is not possible to understand the real conclusion of the Vedas.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that even though the scriptures are readily available, the true essence of Dharma remains hidden, and understanding requires connection to one of the four Vaishnava sampradayas.

Now why is it like this? Because the Dharmasya Tatvam Nihitam Guhayam although all the Vedas are in black and white, Bhagavad Gita is in black and white, 700 shlokas, very simple Sanskrit, not very complicated, but still, people do not understand that the real conclusion of the Bhagavad Gita is that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the duty of every living entity is to surrender to Him as our Lord and Master. This conclusion misses many people, all those people who are not connected to the sampradaya. There are more than 700 editions of the Bhagavad Gita in English alone in the market. But if you read them, you will never get this conclusion that Krishna is the Supreme Person and we are all His eternally, His part and parcel servants. This conclusion you can get only by reading the Bhagavad Gita As It Is by His divine grace, Srila Prabhupada. Therefore, Yudhisthira Maharaj said, even though the Vedas may be in black and white, even though a person may be a Sanskrit scholar, simply by reading the Vedas or simply going to any and every sadhu, simply by using one's logic and intelligence, one cannot understand the real conclusion of the Vedic scriptures. The real understanding if you want to get, then you have to approach one of these four Vaishnava sampradayas.

**Summary:** The Yaksha is pleased with Yudhisthira's answers and offers to bring one of his brothers back to life, presenting Yudhisthira with a difficult choice.

Otherwise it is not possible. Now when Yudhisthira Maharaj finally gave this answer, what was the reaction of the Yaksha and what did he do? The Yaksha became very pleased. He was satisfied with Yudhisthira Maharaj's reply. And he told Yudhisthira Maharaj that I am very very satisfied with your answers. All of your answers are fully in accordance with Dharma, fully in accordance with righteousness as enjoined in the Vedic scriptures. And therefore, as per my promise, I will bring back to life any one of your brothers. You choose whom you want to bring back to life. Now whom did Yudhisthira Maharaj choose to bring back to life? Did he choose Bhima or did he choose Arjuna? Because both of them were the most powerful warriors. Very quickly there was going to be the situation where they would have to take back the kingdom for Duryodhana which was not going to be easy. He was not going to give it on his own. Most likely there would be a battle. And if Yudhisthira Maharaj had to win that battle, the support of Bhima and Arjuna was very essential. Without them he could not think of winning the war. So did he choose Bhima or Arjuna over and above the two brothers Nakula and Sahadeva? Furthermore, Nakula and Sahadeva were his step-brothers, whereas Bhima and Arjuna were his own brothers. Whom did Yudhisthira Maharaj choose? Please join us in the next episode of the Mahabharata.

**Summary:** A recap of the previous episode, focusing on Yudhishthira's encounter with the Yaksha and the dilemma of choosing which brother to bring back to life.

A warm welcome to all of you to today's episode. In the last episode of the Mahabharata, we have seen how Yudhishthira managed to answer all the questions of the Yaksha at the lake of death very satisfactorily. We were told that once Yudhishthira Maharaja had answered all the questions which covered a wide range of topics from dharma to spirituality to material duties etc., after all that, the yaksha informed Yudhishthira Maharaja that he would bring one of his brothers back to life. He would want to bring back to life. The question was whether Yudhishthira would choose Bhima or Arjuna because they were the most powerful warriors and they were the two brothers on whom Yudhishthira Maharaj was entirely dependent upon to win a battle against Duryodhana if it arose, if it was required to get back their kingdom.

**Key Quote:** "When the Yaksha asked Yudhishthira Maharaj to choose one of his brothers to bring back to life, Yudhishthira Maharaj responded that please bring back Nakula to life."
**Summary:** Yudhishthira's surprising choice of Nakula is explained through the lens of dharma, emphasizing equanimity and fairness to both mothers, Kunti and Madri.

Without these two, Yudhishthira Maharaj would be really crippled. When the Yaksha asked Yudhishthira Maharaj to choose one of his brothers to bring back to life, Yudhishthira Maharaj responded that please bring back Nakula to life. This was a very surprising thing. The Yaksha was taken aback. And he asked Yudhishthira Maharaj, Yudhishthira, that everyone knows that Bhima is very dear to you and he has the strength of thousands of elephants put together and Arjuna also is a warrior par excellence. Even the Devatas cannot stand in front of him in battle. Instead of choosing one of these two, the Yaksha asked Yudhishthira Maharaj, why have he chosen your step-brother Nakula? What is the reason? In response, Yudhishthira Maharaj replied, dharma yeva hato hanti dharmo rakshati rakshitah tasmad dharmam nathya jami. He said, Yudhishthira Maharaj replied to the Yaksha, that you see, whoever neglects dharma or does not follow the path of the Yaksha, he is not worthy of the Yaksha. He is not worthy of the Yaksha. He is not worthy of the Yaksha. Whoever does not follow the path of the Brahma, he will eventually be vanquished. Dharma, hato, hanti. A person who brings about the downfall of Dharma himself, will undergo destruction. On the other hand, dharma, rakshati rakshitah. One who protects Dharma will in turn be protected. Tasmad dharmam nathya jami. Therefore, I will not give up Dharma. I will go and save your life. the path of Dharma. Now, what does the following of Dharma have got to do with bringing back Nakula to life? Yudhishthir Maharaj explained to the Yaksha that his father had two wives Kunti and Madri and Yudhishthir Maharaj said, for me both Kunti and Madri are equal to me, both of them are my mothers and I see both of them equally. I am still alive who am Kunti's son. Now, if only one of my brothers is going to be brought back to life, then let one of the sons of Madri also live and that is why I have chosen Nakula and this is according to the rules of

**Key Quote:** "When Yudhishthir Maharaj replied like this, the Yaksha replied, I am very pleased by your benevolence and by your equanimity, your equal vision towards all your brothers. Therefore, I am bringing back all your brothers back to life"
**Summary:** The Yaksha, revealed to be Yamaraja, is pleased with Yudhishthira's adherence to dharma and offers him boons after testing him.

Dharma where kindness is supposed to be practiced by everyone. When Yudhishthir Maharaj replied like this, the Yaksha replied, I am very pleased by your benevolence and by your equanimity, your equal vision towards all your brothers. Therefore, I am bringing back all your brothers back to life and slowly all the four Pandavas who are lying almost dead on the ground next to Yudhishthir Maharaj opened their eyes and they got up as if they had just woken up from some deep slumber. And surprisingly enough, they were no longer feeling thirsty and they felt completely refreshed. When Yudhishthira Maharaj saw this, he looked at the Yaksha and he told him, My dear Yaksha, I don't believe you are a normal Yaksha. No normal Yaksha can do what you have done. First of all, to kill my brothers is impossible for any ordinary Yaksha to do. And after killing them, bringing them back to life. This is indeed a real miracle, which only some great Devata can do. So it is hard for me to believe that you are a simple Yaksha. Please, if you feel it appropriate, please kindly reveal yourself. The Yaksha then suddenly transformed into a Dami God, bedecked with a lot of golden ornaments and wearing silk clothes and looking very handsome. The demigodd revealed Himself to be the Yamaradj who is also known as Dharma Raja. And he responded to Yudhishthira that, My dear son, please know that, I am your father Yamaradj. And today, I have been very pleased with you, I just wanted to test you. And that is how I created this whole situation and I am very pleased with the way you have reacted.

**Key Quote:** "O my Lord, if you want to bless me, kindly give us a boon that that Brahmana whose Arani sticks were taken away by the deer, his Yajna may not be stopped and he should be able to continue his Yajna."
**Summary:** Yudhishthira prioritizes the restoration of a Brahmana's firewood for sacrifice over reclaiming his kingdom, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to dharma and detachment from material desires.

Therefore, being pleased with you, I want to give you some boon. So please ask me whatever you would like to ask. Immediately Yudhishthira Maharaj replied, O my Lord, if you want to bless me, kindly give us a boon that that Brahmana whose Arani sticks were taken away by the deer, his Yajna may not be stopped and he should be able to continue his Yajna. And then Yamaraja replied to Yudhishthira Maharaj, My dear son, please know that the deer was not an ordinary deer, but it was I who took the form of a deer and took away the Arani sticks to lure you to this place so that I could test all of you. Therefore, I am immediately granting you the boon that you have requested for that the Brahmana's Arani wood, the wood for the fire sacrifice, I will return. And immediately he returned the firewood to Yudhishthira Maharaj. And after this, Yamaraja asked Yudhishthira Maharaj, My dear son, I am not satisfied with giving you this boon. This is hardly anything. Please ask something more from me. Actually, Yudhishthira Maharaj could have asked, asked Yamaraja for the kingdom, to get back the kingdom that they had lost. But Yudhishthira Maharaj was so fixed in Dharma that he saw that at the present moment, to get back that Brahmana's firewood sticks was the most important thing for them. Otherwise, they would not be upholding Dharma. And that is why he asked for that. Yudhishthira Maharaj was not so much interested in occupying the throne, having a kingdom, and getting back his lost kingdom. I should take revenge upon Duryodhana. Those things were not there in his heart at all. He was always treading the path of Dharma. And as far as he was concerned, he was quite happy living in the forest, leading an austere life, wearing tree bark for clothes, devoid of all the royal opulence and servants and all the army. And all such things. He was happy as long as he was able to follow the path of Dharma. As far as the kingdom was concerned, in due course of time, according to the law of karma, if they had to get back the kingdom, they would get it. If they would not get, if they were not destined to get it, they would not get it back. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj was not so keen. He was not so concerned about getting back the kingdom.

**Summary:** Yudhishthira requests boons for a successful incognito exile and freedom from negative qualities like lust, anger, and greed, which Yamaraja grants.

Now, when Yamaraja asked him to ask for one more boon, then Yudhishthira Maharaj replied to him that if you want to grant us one more boon, then please bless us that now our 12th year of forest exile is getting over and next year, one year we have to live incognito. If you so wish, please bless us that we may be able to carry out this exile in incognito successfully. Immediately, Dharmaraj replied that, so be it my son, I grant you your boon. In fact, I bless you that even if you roam around in all the prominent cities, dressed in the same way that you are currently as the Pandavas, nobody will be able to recognize you. Even if you go without any disguise, even if you present yourself as you are, nobody will be able to recognize you. This is my boon to you and therefore, I am blessing you that the next one year which you have to live incognito, go to the kingdom of Virata and spend your one year there. And then Yamaaraj said to Yudhishthira Maharaj that I am not satisfied with just giving you two more boons. I want to give you one more boon. Please ask. To which Yudhishthira Maharaj replied, please bless me that I will always tread the path of dharma and I will never be overcome by kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha, matsarya, these six enemies, which are there in the heart. And I will always be able to tread the path of truthfulness. Yamaaraj replied that my dear Yudhishthira Maharaj, right from your birth, by your very nature, you are always on the path of dharma. You are always truthful and kama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha and matsarya have no place in your heart. But still since you are asking, I bless you that you will continue to be free from these voids. And so being blessed by Yamaaraj like this, the Pandavas became very happy and then Yamaaraj also disappeared from the spot.

**Summary:** The Pandavas return the firewood, spend the rainy season in the forest, and then decide to go to Viratanagara for their incognito exile.

Then taking the Brahmana's Arani firewood, the five Pandava brothers they returned and they handed over the firewood to the Brahmana and they continued to live in the forest for the next four months which were the rainy season. Generally in North India, the months starting from July up till about September, these four months are the rainy season. And during the rainy season, during those days, the practice was that people would not travel anywhere, they will stay wherever they are to avoid the troubles of walking through muddy patches of land and also the rainy season is the time when the forest become infested with snakes etc. It's not safe also to travel during the rainy season. So the Pandavas stayed in the Dwaitavana itself for the remainder of the rainy season and once the rainy season was over, the Pandavas started discussing amongst themselves that now the time has come that we have to live incognito. Now where do we go? After discussing various options, they decided that as per what Yamaaraj had blessed them with, they should go to the place known as Viratanagara. This Viratanagara was so called because it was being ruled over by King Virata and the kingdom was also known as the kingdom of Matsya. And this Matsya kingdom, some people say that it is in Rajasthan and Viratanagara is about 60 kilometers from Jaipur. Some other people say it is a place called Bhairhat in Bengal. Either way, it was quite a distance from wherever the Pandavas were there and they undertook a long journey by foot to cover the distance.

**Key Quote:** "Before leaving for Viratanagara, the Pandavas, they sent whatever servants and maidservants they had, they sent them all back to Hastinapura"
**Summary:** The Pandavas prepare for their incognito exile by sending away their servants and deciding on their disguises: Yudhishthira as Kanka, Bhima as Vallabha, and Arjuna as Brihannala, remembering Urvasi's curse.

Before leaving for Viratanagara, the Pandavas, they sent whatever servants and maidservants they had, they sent them all back to Hastinapura and they requested Dhaumya also to... Dhaumya was their family priest who was staying with them. They requested leave from him also. And the Pandavas left all on their own to Viratanagara. Having reached Viratanagara, the Pandavas started discussing amongst themselves, how they would disguise themselves and what they would present themselves as. Although, Yamaraj had blessed them that even if they were to walk around as it was, as they were, nobody would recognize them. Still, they thought it better to disguise themselves. Yudhishthir Maharaj told his brothers that, I will become Kanka and I will become an advisor to Virat Maharaj. I will introduce myself to Virat Maharaj, saying that I used to be an advisor in Yudhishthir Maharaj's court. And now that Yudhishthir Maharaj and the Pandavas are in forest exile, I don't have a job, so I have come seeking a job with you. Then he looked at Bhima and he said, what will you do? Bhima said, I am very good in cooking. I will go to Virat Maharaj and I will tell him, I was a cook in Yudhishthir Maharaj's kitchen and I also know a little bit of wrestling. So please appoint me as a cook in your kitchen and I will make wonderful dishes for you. And also whenever some free time is there, I will wrestle some lions and elephants and all that. And I will keep you entertained. Next, Yudhishthir Maharaj turned to Arjuna and asked him, my dear Arjuna, what will you present yourself as? At that time, Arjuna remembered when he had been to the heavenly kingdom on the invitation of Indra, Urvasi had approached him, but on the plea that Urvasi was the wife of one of the ancestors of Arjuna's dynasty, the King Pururava, whose wife was Urvasi, Arjuna said, you are like my mother and therefore I cannot see you in any other manner. And being rebuffed like this, Urvasi being frustrated in her advances towards Arjuna, she cursed him that for one year he will have to become a eunuch. Now Arjuna remembered that curse of Urvasi and he said, now is the time for Urvasi's curse to take place. I'll become a eunuch. And because I know good music and dancing, I will teach all the women folk in Virat Maharaj's palace, all the different forms of singing and dance. So the brothers were surprised to hear this. Arjuna, the great warrior, he is going to become a eunuch for one year. Anyway, this is all destiny. The Lord's leelas are like this.

**Key Quote:** "Then Yudhishthira Maharaj turned to Sahadeva and asked him, what will you do?"
**Summary:** Sahadeva and Nakula choose their disguises as a cowherd and horse caretaker, respectively, and the Pandavas cleverly hide their weapons in a tree at the crematorium.

Then Yudhishthira Maharaj turned to Sahadeva and asked him, what will you do? Sahadeva replied, I will become a cowherd by the name Tantripala and I will take care of the cows in Virat Maharaj's palace. And then Nakula said that I will become Granthika, a person who takes care of horses, because Nakula was very expert in identifying horses, taking care of them, breeding them, etc. And therefore Nakula said, I will take a place in the stable of Virat Maharaj. Having discussed like this, all the Pandavas decided that okay, now we know what all we will become. And so therefore, now what to do with all our weapons? If the cook Bhima, who is going to be the cook named Vallabha, if he is going to go with his Ghada into the assembly, then nobody will believe that he is a cook. And if Arjuna goes with his Gandiva and says, I am a unit, nobody is going to believe him. Therefore, all the Pandavas wrapped up all their weapons in a nice piece of cloth, completely covered it up. And when they approached Virat Nagar, at the entry to the Virat Nagara, they came across a big crematorium. And outside the crematorium was a big semi-tree. They climbed onto the semi-tree and on the top of the semi-tree, they kept all the packed weapons. And they left the place. Some people were there who were coming to the crematorium. They came across some people and they told them in our custom, all dead bodies we cover in cloth and keep it on top of the semi-tree so that the soul goes to heaven. And our mother recently passed away. So we have put her corpse, we have covered it in a cloth and kept it on the top. When the people heard, they said, oh my God, corpse up there, we should not touch it. And this way, the Pandavas thought, nobody will touch those.

**Summary:** Yudhishthira (as Kanka) and Bhima (as Vallabha) gain employment in King Virata's court, while Draupadi (as Sairindri) seeks service with Queen Sudeshna.

Nobody will become curious enough to go and unpack those weapons. The first day, Yudhishthir Maharaj entered the court of Virat Maharaj and he introduced himself as Kanka. And he told the king that he had been an advisor in the court of Yudhishthir Maharaj. And when Virat Maharaj heard this, Virata was actually a great front of the Pandavas. When he heard that this Kanka had been an advisor in Yudhishthir Maharaj's palace, he very warmly welcomed Kanka and he told him, please welcome, please be an advisor to me also. I don't know how the Pandavas are living in the forest. It is a very unfortunate situation. I hope very quickly that gets over. He was also feeling a little bad about that. The following day, Bhima entered the court of Virata Maharaj. And he introduced himself as Vallabha, the cook. And he told the king that please appoint me in your kitchen. I used to cook in Yudhishthir Maharaj's kitchen. And I know a variety of dishes and every day I will cook very fine dishes for you. The king was very pleased to see this huge able-bodied cook. And he said, okay, since you are coming from Yudhishthir Maharaj's kitchen, you must definitely be a good cook. So right away, I am appointing you. The next day, Draupadi entered the kingdom. And she approached the king Virata's wife, Sudeshna. And she introduced herself as a class of maidservants known as Sairindri. And she informed Sudeshna that she had been earlier a servant of Draupadi as well as Satyabhama. And now that Draupadi had gone into the forest in exile, she had lost her job and she was looking for a job. And that's how she had come to meet Sudeshna seeking an employment. Sudeshna, when she looked at this woman, she saw that she was extremely exquisitely beautiful. She told her that if you have served as Satyabhama, Krishna's wife and Draupadi, definitely you must be very qualified. I will be very happy to have you with me. But seeing your beauty, I am very afraid that the king may get carried away and he may think of making you the queen. Then what will become of me?

**Summary:** Draupadi sets conditions for her service, and Arjuna, disguised as Brihannala, is accepted as a dance teacher for Princess Uttara after being confirmed as a eunuch.

Then this Sairindri maidservant replied to Sudeshna that please do not worry. I am married to five Gandharva husbands and I am completely devoted and chaste to my husbands. I will never look at any other man. As far as you are concerned, you protect me from other men. I will be only with you. I don't want to be in any place where the men will be able to see me. When Sudeshna heard this, she said, okay, in that case, I am quite pacified that you will not try to woo my husband and take over my place. Then I am willing to appoint you as a maidservant in my palace. And then Draupadi told Sudeshna two conditions I want to put before you. One is that you will not make me wash anybody's feet and I will not eat any leftover food. Sudeshna immediately agreed. She said, no problem. I will ensure that you get the best food and you won't have to wash anybody's feet. The next day, Arjuna walked into the court of Virataraj and everyone was astonished to see this huge bodied man dressed in a sari and hands full of bangles and walking like a woman, although externally it was obvious that it was a man. And the King Virata was also astonished. And he asked, who are you? Where have you come from? And why have you come to my court? Then this Brihannala, this eunuch introduced herself saying that my name is Brihannala. I am a eunuch and I have no parents. I know the art of singing and dance. So I am requesting you. Please appoint me to teach the art of dancing and singing to your daughter Uttara. The King Virata also looked at Brihannala and then he said that if you are truly a eunuch, I don't mind appointing you. And so he had a few maidservants from his palace inspect Brihannala. They took away Brihannala for some time and they came back and they reported to the King that they have tested him. He is clearly a eunuch. He is not a male. Then Virata, Virata Maharaj was also happy to appoint Brihannala as a teacher of dance and singing for his daughter Uttara. And because of Urvashi's curse, Arjuna in the form of Brihannala felt no lusty desires awakening in his heart, even when he was in the midst of all the women folk in the palace.

**Key Quote:** "So, in case of any danger and in case of need of any help, they decided on code names by which they would call each other."
**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, detailing the Pandavas' decision to go incognito in the kingdom of Virata, their chosen disguises, and the secret code names they established for emergencies.

All of you are welcome to this next episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode, we have seen how the Pandavas had completed their 12 years of forest exile and now it was time for them to go incognito. And fortunately, they also happened to receive the blessings of Yamaraj, by which they were assured that they would be able to successfully go back to their native land. They were able to successfully pass the time of one year incognito without anyone recognizing them. Having now obtained the boon from Yamaraj, still the Pandavas felt it wise to disguise themselves and as advised by Yamaraj, they decided to go to the kingdom of Virata. And in the kingdom of Virata, the five Pandavas entered Virata separately. Yudhishthir Maharaj became Kanka, an advisor to the king. Bhima became Vallabha, a cook in the royal kitchens. Draupadi became Sairindri, a maid-servant who dresses the hairs for the queen of King Virata, Sudeshna. Arjuna became Brihannala, a eunuch, and he was appointed by King Virata to teach art of dance and music to his young daughter Uttara. And then Nakula became Granthika, who was going to take care of the horses in the stable of King Virata. Sahadeva became Tantripala, who was going to take care of the cows of King Virata. After entering the kingdom of Virata, the Pandavas had a secret code by which they would call each other if any one of them were to be in any kind of trouble or danger and they needed the help of the others. In case they were in danger, because they were all entering separately and they were not in their disguise going to reveal that they were related to each other in any way, they would not be able to call out the names what they had assumed, nor could they call out their original names. So, in case of any danger and in case of need of any help, they decided on code names by which they would call each other. So, they gave themselves the names of Jayanta, Vijaya, Jaya, Jayat Sena, Jayat Bala. Like this, they gave each other names by which they could call out, any one of them could call out the other's names, and then immediately the others would understand that there is some danger and this person needed help.

### Duryodhana, spies, Keechaka, Virata's kingdom, power, protection

**Key Quote:** "Although Keechaka was a disturbance, he was also a great protective shield for Virata's kingdom."
**Summary:** The lecture describes Duryodhana's efforts to uncover the Pandavas' disguise and introduces Keechaka, the powerful commander-in-chief of Virata's army, highlighting his influence and the kingdom's dependence on him.

Now, the Pandavas, they had entranced themselves in their respective positions and things were going quite smoothly. Nobody had detected them. In the meantime, Duryodhana had started sending spies all over the place. They were going to various kingdoms and they were observing who are the kind of people there, whether the Pandavas are there or not. Because Duryodhana's intention was, if somehow or the other he is able to uncover their disguise, then again the Pandavas would have to go into another 12 years of forest exile. So, he could very comfortably, without any opposition, he could enjoy the kingdom of the Pandavas as well as his own kingdom which was Hastinapura. Now, although the spies were going everywhere, they could not find any trace of the Pandavas. And so, the Pandavas were able to keep up their disguise very effectively for more than 10 months. During these 10 months, the Pandavas were able to live peacefully. More or less, they were avoiding all attention. And Bhima would also, because he was a cook, he was in the kitchen, whenever he would cook some delicacies, he would come in the night secretly, meet with his other brothers and share with them. And sometimes Tantripala would get some cow milk products, he would share it with his brothers. And sometimes Yudhishthira would get some gifts from the king, he would come and share it with the brothers. So, like this, they were managing to pass their time. Although they were not very happy being servants to subordinate kings, it was not the ideal position to be in, but they were not in any kind of trouble also. Now, like this, after more than 10 months had passed, they were into the 11th month. This queen Sudeshna had a brother and the name of this brother was Keechaka. He was extremely powerful and very well built and he was very expert in fighting and in the art of warfare. Therefore, King Virata had appointed Keechaka as his commander-in-chief of his army. Now, this Keechaka was quite a terror and he had created lot of problems for all the surrounding neighboring kingdoms and even for the Kauravas, this Keechaka was a headache. But then he was quite powerful, so nobody dared to oppose him openly like that. Nobody wanted a direct confrontation like that. So, to maintain peace, they would tolerate his, he would sometimes encroach on them. He would encroach into others' kingdoms. He would go and sometimes pillage a town or something like that. Those kind of things he was off and on doing. But rival kings were keeping distance because they didn't want to antagonize him. And Virata was also heavily dependent on Keechaka for the protection of his kingdom. Although Keechaka was a disturbance, he was also a great protective shield for Virata's kingdom. Otherwise, the surrounding neighboring enemy kings could easily swallow the kingdom of Virata. Virata, King Virata himself was not so powerful. So, he was quite lenient and he used to not take too much notice of the wrongdoings of Keechaka.

**Key Quote:** "Actually, you should be in a much better condition than this. Why don't you become my queen?"
**Summary:** Keechaka sees Draupadi (Sairindri) and becomes infatuated with her, proposing to her and being rebuffed. He then enlists his sister Sudeshna's help to woo her.

Now, this Keechaka one day happened to visit his sister Sudeshna and there he happened to see Draupadi who was a Sai Rindri. Now, when he saw her, immediately this Keechaka, he was infatuated with her. And he was not a man of any great good morals or something like that. So, he immediately developed lusty desires towards Sai Rindri. And he started asking Sudeshna, Who is this girl? I have never seen her before. Where has she come from? What is she doing? And all these kind of things. And then when Draupadi, Sai Rindri came to Sudeshna for some work, immediately Keechaka started talking to her. Oh, my beautiful girl. Who are you? Where are you from? I have never seen you before. I am Keechaka. I am the commander of the king's army. So, you are serving like a maid servant in my sister's palace. Actually, you should be in a much better condition than this. Why don't you become my queen? Like this, he started talking. Now, Sai Rindri immediately, she got alarmed. What is this man saying? All these months, she had managed to keep a low profile and avoid the gaze of any men. And somehow, she was managing. Because Draupadi was exquisitely beautiful. That was the fear that Sudeshna also had. Now, Keechaka's eyes, unfortunately, fell on Sai Rindri. Now, Sai Rindri, immediately she was taken aback. And she said, Oh, my... Oh, king, please don't talk like this. Because I am already wedded to another person. So, it is not appropriate for a person like you, who is from a royal family, to set his eyes upon a woman who is already married. This is against the principles of Dharma. So, please give up such thoughts. And please avoid thinking of me in such way. And give up any hopes like this if you have towards developing any relationship with me. Like this, Sai Rindri said. And she immediately turned and walked away. Now, Keechaka was not someone to give up so easily. Although he was rebuffed by Sai Rindri, he was not, in the least, he was not deterred. He spoke to Sudeshna and he said that somehow I have to get her. How to get her hand? How to woo her? How to make her agree to my proposal? So, Sudeshna looked at her brother. And because he was, after all, her brother, she said, Don't worry, because in front of everybody, she might have felt a little shy. So, she might have spoken like that. I will create some excuse and send her to you for some small work. At that time, in a secluded place, you propose to her. Maybe, if you nicely talk to her, she may change her mind also. Sudeshna said like this. Because in those times, in the royal family, sometimes the kings would have relationships with some of the maid servants also. Although they may not be wedded with the maid servants. And this was not so uncommon. And so, Sudeshna thought, Maybe, Sairendri may become interested. If she becomes interested and both adults are consenting, then what's the problem?

**Key Quote:** "Oh, my dear lady, you have already seen that day, how he was talking to me. And he has these kind of lusty desires to me."
**Summary:** Sudeshna, despite Draupadi's objections, sends her to Keechaka's chambers. Draupadi prays to Suryadeva for protection as she goes.

So, then, after a few days, Sudeshna found some opportunity. And she told Draupadi, Sairendri, that you please fetch some rice and some other things from my brother's chambers. You please go and get it. Now, Sairendri immediately told Sudeshna, Oh, my dear lady, you have already seen that day, how he was talking to me. And he has these kind of lusty desires to me. Now, if I go to his chambers, God alone knows what is going to happen. So, please don't put me into this kind of a dilemma. Please don't put me into any embarrassing situation like this. Now, Sudeshna, she dismissed her. She said, don't worry. You tell him that I have sent you. So, he will not try anything wrong with you. He will not misbehave with you. Don't worry about that. He is not going to have that much guts to do something. Then, I have sent somebody. So, don't worry. Like that, Sudeshna, somehow she brushed aside Sairendri's objections and sent her. Now, Sairendri, what to do? Now, she was almost on the verge of crying. She knew what was going to happen with Keechaka. And so, as she stepped out of the place and then she was proceeding towards the Keechaka's chambers, she looked up at the sky and looked at Suryadeva. Suryadeva, the sun was shining very strongly. So, she looked up at him and she prayed, please protect me, like that, and she went. It was a very informal kind of prayer from her side, from Draupadi's side. But then, what we have to understand is, all the Pandavas, including Draupadi, are great devotees of Lord Krishna. And in the Rig Veda also it is said, OM TAD VISHNOH PARAMAM PADAM SADAPASHYANTI SURAYAH DIVIVA CHAKSHU RATATAM TAD VIPRASO VIPANYAVO JAGRAVAMSA SAMINDATE VISHNO ORYAT PARAMAM PADAM.

**Key Quote:** "If you want to love me, first learn to love my dog."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the relationship between the Devatas and Vishnu, emphasizing that devotion to Vishnu extends to his devotees. Suryadeva, recognizing Draupadi's devotion to Krishna, sends a Rakshasa to protect her.

Vishnu's lotus feet are considered the supreme destination, even for the Devatas. So, even the Devatas are constantly waiting, when can we have darshan of the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu. So, all the Devatas are always trying to please Lord Vishnu. They are trying to please and serve Lord Vishnu in some way or the other. Why? Because Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, AHAM ADHIRHI DEVANAM. Krishna is the source of all the Devatas. The Devatas are all created by Krishna himself, by Vishnu. So, naturally, Krishna, so Vishnu being the supreme creator, all the Devatas are always looking for opportunities to serve Vishnu. Now, there is a saying that, If you want to love me, first learn to love my dog. The idea behind this saying is that, If you want to love me, then you should love everyone else that I also love. You cannot say that I love you, but I hate your father and mother. I am a big enemy of your brother, but I love you. You cannot say that. If you have to love me, then you have to love all the people that I love also. This is generally saying like that. So, all the Devatas, the demigods, they are all great devotees of Vishnu. They are also very respectful and devoted to all the devotees of Vishnu. Now, the Pandavas are great devotees of Lord Krishna. They are eternal associates of Lord Krishna. Therefore, all the Devatas, all the demigods have the greatest of respect for the Pandavas. And naturally, Suri Deva also, when he saw that, Draupadi has asked for my protection, then he felt obliged. Oh, she is a great devotee of Krishna, so I have to provide protection to her. Although, she asked very casually, just in a passing, she asked Draupadi. But still, for Suri Deva, it was like a great prayer for him. Because, Draupadi was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. And so, immediately, Suri Deva summoned one Rakshasa and told him, Please go and always, whenever there is a problem, Draupadi steps out of her residence, always be with her. And constantly protect her. And so, this Rakshasa, he invisibly started following Draupadi,

who walked into Keechaka's chamber. Now, when Draupadi walked into Keechaka's chamber, Keechaka was very happy to see her. He was very glad to see her. Ah! Sairendri has come. Of course, he could not see the Rakshasa who was following close behind, whom Surya had sent. And so, he said, Oh! My Sairendri, my dear lady, you have come. Please tell me, what have you come for? What is the purpose? Sairendri said, Sudeshna has asked for some things, which I have to take from here. Please provide to me. The queen is also waiting. I should not keep her waiting. Quickly, I have to go. Please, as soon as possible, please hand over the things. Keechaka, she was carrying a golden pot in her hand. Keechaka took the pot from her. And he gave it to one of his servants who was standing there. And he said, Don't worry. My servants will take care of it. Fill it and send it to Sudeshna. And he said, You don't worry. You sit with me. You sit down. I want to talk to you. And he started all kinds of sweet talks, which Sairendri was not happy to hear. And he said, Sorry, I have to take this. I have been given the order by Sudeshna. So, please don't prevent me. Please give me the pot. I want to take it and go. And if you are not giving it to me, I will go myself. And then, Keechaka, what he did? He caught hold of Sairendri. And he started pulling her to him. Now, Sairendri got alarmed. Now, what to do? She gave Keechaka one push on the chest. And this caught Keechaka completely unaware. And because he was not expecting it, he got off balance and he fell down. Taking the opportunity, immediately Draupadi turned and she fled out of the room. And Keechaka managed to pull himself together. Then he got up. Then he started chasing Sairendri. Hey, where are you going? Stop. Wait. I am telling you to stop. Like that. Now, Sairendri, she got very afraid. Now, this Keechaka is not leaving me. He is pursuing me. Now, where shall I go? What shall I do? She ran into the court, into the assembly of King Virata. Where Virata was sitting, all his ministers were sitting. And it so happened that Kanka and Vallabha were also in the assembly at that point of time. Sairendri ran into that assembly. And from behind, Keechaka is pursuing. And the moment she entered the assembly, Keechaka caught hold of her hair and he started dragging her. And when Draupadi tried to resist, Keechaka gave her a mighty kick on her back. And Sairendri fell down on the floor. Now, when this happened, the Rakshasa, who was sent by Surya, he could not tolerate. He went and gave one strong kick to Keechaka on his chest. And Keechaka fell over and he got thrown behind. He was flung behind. And he went and landed on the floor. And the impact was so huge that he got completely disoriented. And then he started looking around. He was completely dazed. What had happened? Suddenly, from somewhere, some foals came and flung him on the floor with a huge impact on the chest. And he was not able to figure out what happened.

**Summary:** Draupadi pleads for justice in the assembly, criticizing the inaction of King Virata and indirectly appealing to Yudhishthira and Bhima. Bhima is enraged but restrained by Yudhishthira to protect their disguise.

And nobody could figure out what happened suddenly to Keechaka. And seeing the opportunity, that Keechaka was dazed and he was, for a moment he had forgotten about this Sairendri, she got up and started pleading to Virata, O my king, please see what kind of thing is happening in your kingdom. A woman's honour is being violated. That too, right in front of you in your assembly. This Keechaka has come and kicked me in front of you. In front of you in the assembly. And because I resisted his advances. He wanted to own me, although he knows I am a married woman. And he, because I resisted, he has insulted me, humiliated me like this. How can such a thing happen in the presence of such great kings? Indirectly, Draupadi was referring to Yudhishthir Maharaj and to Bhima, who are also there. I have got five Gandharva kings. They are very powerful. Unfortunately, they are not taking any action right now. Otherwise, if they were to take cognisance of this, they would completely annihilate all the people like Keechaka, would have no chance to continue living. So like this, Draupadi indirectly started telling Yudhishthira and Bhima. She was criticizing them. Now, when Bhima saw this, his fury went beyond his control. His eyes went red. His whole body was trembling. And then he stood up to go and attack Keechaka. He would have finished Keechaka right there. But then, that would have blown the disguise of the Pandavas. So immediately, Yudhishthira Maharaj gently tapped Bhima on his hand. And when Bhima looked down and he saw Yudhishthira Maharaj motioning him to sit down, with great difficulty, Bhima restrained himself and sat down.

**Summary:** King Virata hesitates to act against Keechaka. Yudhishthira intervenes, advising Draupadi to leave. Draupadi complies, and Keechaka storms out of the room.

And then King Virata now, he was in a dilemma. He knew that what was happening with Saiyarendri was unjust. At the same time, he did not want to antagonize him. He did not want to antagonize Keechaka because his whole kingdom was resting on his protection. So, Virata, very diplomatically, the King Virata, he said, you please see, maid servant, without hearing both the parties, how can I take a decision? I have not heard what is Keechaka's side of the story. I have heard what you said, but I have to hear what he also has said. Otherwise, how can I decide something? How can I decide that he has behaved unjustly to you? Like this, he started saying. Now, in the meantime, Keechaka had picked himself up and slowly, he was gathering himself and he was coming back to his senses and gathering what had happened, what was going on right there. Now, Yudhishthir Maharaj took advantage of this and he said, maid servant, O Saiyarendri, this is neither the time, nor the opportunity, nor the place for you to air your grievances. Please go back to your chambers and you discuss this with Sudeshna. This is not the place for you to air all your grievances. Please carry on. This is not the, you should not continue to be here. The situation is not favorable. Immediately, Saiyarendri also took the cue from what Kanka had said and she left the palace and went back to Sudeshna's chambers. So, by the time, Keechaka had collected himself, Saiyarendri had already left. And now, what she had already left? So, he also stormed out of the room.

**Key Quote:** "Something has to be done."
**Summary:** Sudeshna expresses anger at Keechaka's actions. Draupadi, fearing further attacks, contemplates a plan to escape his clutches, setting the stage for the next episode.

Sudeshna got very angry. I never expected this from my brother. If he has done this, I will tell the king and see that he is put to the gallows. I will see that he pays for this with his life. Like this, Sudeshna also got very upset, angry because she had not expected that Keechaka would force himself upon her. She had thought he will propose to her. Mostly she may agree. If she doesn't agree, she will come away. Like that she had thought. She had not thought that he would go to this extent of humiliating her, trying to forcibly capture her and all these kind of things. So, it came as a surprise for her also. Then Draupadi told her, no, no, no need for you to complain to King Virata and all that. My Gandharva husbands are there. They will take care. Like that she said and with still tears flowing from her eyes, she went to her chambers and then she started taking rest. And although she went back to her chamber, she took bath because she wanted to take rest. She took bath because she wanted to. She was feeling so bad that Keechaka had touched her with his own hands. So, she felt, you know, let me take bath and purify myself. And after taking bath, she also felt fresh and little pacified. And then she was sitting on her bed and she was thinking, now this much has happened. This Keechaka is not going to keep quiet. He will try somehow or the other to capture me and he will try to violate me. So, this is not going to end here. The matter is not going to end here. Something has to be done. And she also saw how King Virata was helpless in front of Keechaka. So, the king, she could not expect any protection from the king also. And as far as Sudeshna was concerned, she was a simple woman and unlikely that she would be able to withstand the manipulations of Keechaka. Keechaka would again come and try somehow manipulate her and she would, he would mislead her and he would take away Draupadi. So, all these were possibilities that could happen. Now, Draupadi was very worried. What will happen now? How could she protect herself? What to do? How to save herself from Keechaka? And she started thinking. And then slowly a plan dawned upon her. She thought of a plan by which she could escape from the clutches of Keechaka. So, what was the plan that Draupadi had thought of? Please join us in the next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna. Jagatguru Srila Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "When Sairindhri heard this, she also felt this is a good idea and she said, okay, all right, I will do like what you have said."
**Summary:** The Pandavas devise a plan to kill Keechaka, with Draupadi feigning interest in him to lure him into a trap.

you have to vanquish him. The only way is to kill Keechaka. We have no other alternative because if the Pandavas were going to tell that we are Pandavas, this is Draupadi, then their disguise is blown and they will have to go again for another 12 years in the forest exile. Now, there is no other option but to kill this Keechaka. Bhima said, okay, all right, let us do like this. You go back to your quarters now. Tomorrow morning, you go to Keechaka and then Bhima delineated to her a plan which he had formulated, what Sairindhri has to do. When Sairindhri heard this, she also felt this is a good idea and she said, okay, all right, I will do like what you have said. And so, she took leave of Pallava and she went back to her quarters. The night passed, the sun rose, Sairindhri woke up, she bathed, finished all her monsoons. She went back to her quarters and she said, okay, all right, I will do like what you have said. And so, she took leave of Pallava and she went back to her quarters. The night passed, morning ablutions, dressed herself and then she went to Keechaka's chambers. Now, Keechaka, when he saw Sairindhri coming, he was surprised and he thought maybe she has changed her mind and he started singing to her, oh, Sairindhri, you have come out of your own accord. Good, good, good, come, come. You saw what happened in the assembly. You saw how King Virata did not say anything. So, although Virata is king, he is king in name only. Actually, I am the king. I am the de facto king. So, you do not worry. If you become my consort, I am telling you, I will take care of you better than my queen. You will have the position of a queen and I will take care of all your comforts. You do not have to be a servant to anyone in future. Your future is secure. And I am Keechaka. I am practically, I call all the shots here. So, do not worry at all. Like this, Keechaka started talking to Sairindhri. And Sairindhri also acted as if she was favorable towards him. And she told him, you see, that day, I had to behave like that. It was not actually something which I wanted to do. But somehow, things went out of hand that way. I understand your desire also. My worry was that if my Gandharva husbands come to know that we both have associated, then it will create trouble for you as well as me. So, I just want to avoid that. That is all. So, I thought over. And I also desire to have a union with you. So, how to do it was what was bothering my

mind. So, I have thought of an idea. So, immediately, Keechaka got very interested. He said, oh, really? Oh, this was the situation. Then no problem. Tell, we will find some solution. We will work out. Then Sairindhri told him, you see, if both of us, we meet in an isolated, secluded place in the night, when nobody is watching and we unite, nobody should come to know about it as long as it is a secluded place and not in your chambers where all servants are coming and going, already people have seen me coming in and nobody should get a whiff of our relationship, so if my Gandharva kings, my Gandharva husbands don't come to know about my relationship with you then things are no problem, not an issue. So then Keechaka said, so what do you suggest we do? Sairindhri said, there is the dancing hall. There is that hall where all the princesses, the princess Uttara and her companions and all, they go for learning dance and music and all that. They, during daytime, they learn all their dance and music and all that and during night time it is closed and nobody is there, nobody goes there because it is dedicated for the princess and so nobody else goes there and the princess comes only during the daytime for learning, night time she doesn't come there, so night time is completely deserted. So tonight why don't you come there? I will also come and then I will try to satisfy you to the best of my ability. Keechaka was thrilled. This was something which he had not expected at all. What a wonderful turn of events. He said, don't worry Sairindhri, I'll come. I will come at the appointed time, don't worry. I will try to come and improve what possessions did he realize at that time. He said, I will be there and you also, you go now and we will meet in the evening. I am very happy with your proposal.

And they decided that okay, now whatever happened, Keechaka has to be, his final rites have to be performed. And then Keechaka had many, many followers. And all these followers, they, when they heard the news, they all came and they started making preparations for the cremation of Keechaka. They were all die-hard fans, they were all die-hard loyal servants, followers of Keechaka. When they heard that Sairindhri's Gandharva husband has killed Keechaka. All of these servants, they went to, went in front of King Virata and said, See, we have heard that Sairindhri is the cause of all this, whatever mishappening has taken place. And Keechaka has got killed only because of her. So, we should kill her also, we should not leave her, let her go scot-free. So, please give us permission, we want, when we are doing the final rites of Keechaka, along with him, we want to burn her also to death. Now, these followers of Keechaka were also very strong and powerful, and Keechaka had become very powerful because of them. Now, Keechaka was already killed. Now, Virata was thinking that, who will now protect my kingdom? And now, these are his people, if he does not pacify them, they will turn, they will rebel against him. So, he said, okay, do whatever you want. Now, for the sake of one maidservant, he is not going to jeopardize his own position. So, all these people, the followers of Keechaka, they came. And they forcibly caught hold of Draupadi and started pulling her and taking her away to the crematorium, saying that, because of you, Keechaka desired you, and because of you, he had to meet his death. So, Keechaka is going to be burned, you also go with him.

**Key Quote:** "Like that, she started shouting."
**Summary:** Draupadi is dragged to the crematorium and calls out to her Gandharva husbands using code names, prompting Bhima to spring into action.

So, like that, they started dragging her also to the crematorium. And they started taking the procession of the dead body of Keechaka to the crematorium. Now, Draupadi is in a great anxiety. Now, what will happen to her? She never expected this turn of events. So, now what to do? Then she remembered the code names that they had agreed upon to call each other in case of any great danger. Because she cannot now call out to Bhima. If she calls out to Bhima, their disguise is blown. She cannot call out to Vallabha. She cannot call out to Brihannala. Because if she does that, then again people will start thinking, why is Saiyarindri calling these people? Why are they coming to protect her? Then also their disguise will be blown. So, then she remembered the code names that they had decided upon. And she started calling out, may my Gandharva husbands, Jayanta, Vijaya, Jaya, Jayat Sena, Jayat Bala, let them all, may they protect me from the danger I am in. Otherwise, I will die. Like that, she started shouting. Now, when she started shouting like this, Vallabha, who was in the kitchen or somewhere, he heard her shouting and immediately understood, oh, this is Draupadi's voice and she is in great danger. Now, I have to save her. Now, thinking like this, immediately Bhima sprung into action. Now, what did Bhima do? And was he able to protect Draupadi before she was taken to the crematorium and forcibly put onto the burning pyre of Keechaka? Please join us in the next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the events leading up to Draupadi's near immolation, focusing on Keechaka's death and the subsequent actions of his followers.

Hare Krishna. In the last episode of the Mahabharata, we have seen how Keechaka tried to force himself upon Draupadi and how she found a solution for the problem by engaging Bhima to fight with Keechaka and kill him. This man's hands were imperen moetBe Keechaka point beaut. In the night it was unoccupied and nobody noticed it. AnnSmall and Pandavas cover was also not blown. Keechaka was also taken care of. Draupadi managed to escape from the part of boiling oil. Frau Buddha managed to escape from the pot of boiling oil. She literally fell into the fire, from the frying pan into the fire. What happened after Keechaka's death came to light and people came to know that Keechaka was killed by the Gandharva husband of Sairindhri because he had tried to woo Sairindhri against her wishes. Then Keechaka's followers, they all captured Sairindhri and they decided that when we are cremating Keechaka along with him because Keechaka's last desire was to enjoy Sairindhri, let us put Sairindhri also into the fire and we will take revenge against her for being the cause of the death of our leader, of our commander Keechaka. And so now, literally Draupadi found herself in a position of being pushed into the fire from the frying pan.

### Pandavas, code names, Bhima's intervention, disguise

**Key Quote:** "So, she called out the code names, Jaya, Vijaya, Jayanta, Jayat Sena, Jayat Bala, like this she called out to them saying that she is in danger."
**Summary:** Draupadi uses pre-arranged code names to call for help, and Bhima, hearing her cries, prepares to rescue her while maintaining their disguise.

Now, what could she do? She called out to the five code names which the Pandavas had discussed amongst themselves which they would call out in case of any danger because at that point of time, she could not call out the original names of the Pandavas. If she did that, their disguise would be blown. And if she called the names by which they were known in Virata, Kanka, Vallabha, Brihannala, Granthika, Tantripala, if she were to call out these names, then also the question would arise how Sairindhri knows them and what is their connection that would again lead to their disguise being blown. So, she called out the code names, Jaya, Vijaya, Jayanta, Jayat Sena, Jayat Bala, like this she called out to them saying that she is in danger. Now, Bhima who was known as Vallabha, he heard Sairindhri's cries for help and he realized what was happening that she was being taken away by the Pandavas. He realized that she was being taken away by Keechaka's, his people. So, what did Bhima do? Bhima wrapped a cloth around his face so that nobody could recognize him like a mask and through a back door, he went out of the kitchen and then through some other path, through some other shortcut, he went to the crematorium where Keechaka's followers were bringing Sairindhri as well as Keechaka. When the followers of Keechaka, dragging Draupadi along and then carrying Keechaka, naturally we can expect they are taking the procession of a dead body. So, they would have passed through various streets in the city because Keechaka was one of the prominent people in the city. He was the commander-in-chief of the army. Naturally, they would have slowly, the procession would have proceeded slowly. They would have given an opportunity for everybody to see him and pay their final respects and all that. So, gradually, slowly they reached the crematorium. When the whole retinue reached the crematorium, they found one huge tall man standing there with one uprooted tree in his hand and wearing a mask around his face who was actually none other than Bhima. And so, these Keechaka's understood that this man is not in a peaceful mood. He is standing in a fighting mood and they guessed who is this man who is stopping our path and they guessed, oh, this must be one of the Gandharva husbands of Sairindhri. Come on, let us kill him also.

**Key Quote:** "In short, in a short period of time Bhima finished all of them."
**Summary:** Bhima single-handedly defeats Keechaka's 300 followers, rescuing Draupadi and then returning unnoticed.

And they took up their arms and they rushed towards this man who was standing like that personified. And these people, the followers of Keechaka were not small in number. Nowadays, when we see some demonstration happening, we see some 10 people gathered together. Media comes and takes their photo from one angle and say there are a lot of protesters and all that. But this was not like that. There were about 300 of them. Not a small number. Big number. And they were all warriors. They all fell upon Bhima with a vengeful spirit because they wanted to avenge the death of their leader. And now Bhima was also not in a, he was not in a conciliatory mood. There was so much pent up fury inside him also. So many years over, they have been living in forest exile and they come to this one, to Virata to live in incognito. So much humiliation. He would not take out his, vent out his frustration and anger. It had all been building up. So now was a great opportunity for Bhima to vent out his frustration and anger built up over almost 13 years. So Bhima also fought furiously with them. And in no time everywhere there were hands, legs, heads strewn around, torsos with, headless torsos. There was blood flowing around. In short, in a short period of time Bhima finished all of them. And then after he killed all of them. Bhima released Sairendri and then he took the shortcut again and unnoticed by anyone he went back to his place in the kitchen. And finally Draupadi as Sairendri she silently walked back to the city. And suddenly the people are seeing that just now this big procession of 300 people they had taken Sairendri with an intention to burn her with Keechaka. And now she is coming back unharmed. And people started questioning what happened? What happened? Then slowly news started coming in that there was this Gandharva husband of Sairendri who came and he has killed all the followers of Keechaka also.

Please you have given me shelter. You have given me shelter for more than 11 months. Now only less than 2 more weeks. Please accommodate me. And Sudeshna said okay no problem.

**Summary:** News of Keechaka's death reaches the Kauravas, and Duryodhana becomes suspicious of Draupadi and her 'Gandharva' husbands, fearing they are the Pandavas in disguise.

So they were in the final stage of their exile. Now while all this was going on this news about the death of Keechaka spread everywhere not only within Virata but even to all the neighboring kingdoms also the message started spreading. Soon the news reached Hastinapura. And the Kauravas also came to know like this Keechaka has been killed. Keechaka was a very powerful warrior. And he had avoided the Virata kingdom coming under the subjugation of the Kaurava rulers. So they had always felt that somehow we are not able to subdue him. Now when the news came that Keechaka is dead he is no more. They were all very relieved. Now this very easily King Virata is now weakened. We can subjugate him. Like this they were thinking. Now the news also reached them. About how Keechaka got killed. So when Duryodhana heard that there was this one Sairindhri one maid servant. And she has five Gandharva husbands. And one of the Gandharva husbands killed Keechaka in the middle of the night when nobody was there. He got a little suspicious. Why is it like this? Why would even Gandharvas also don't come and they are not cowards. They will not fight in the dark when nobody is around and all that. Why did they not openly challenge Keechaka and fight with him. Like this some doubt started running in Duryodhana's mind. But more important thing for him. What was occupying his mind was. Less than two weeks were left. For the time of the one year exile of the Pandavas living incognito was getting over.

Now Duryodhana was getting worried. Because all his spies were coming back and saying. That we are not able to find trace of anywhere. Where the Pandavas are there. Now if they finish their period of exile successfully. Then he would have to return their kingdom. Which was never Duryodhana's intention anyway. He always thought very easily. I will be able to discover their disguise. And we will send them another twelve years in forest. He was expecting that. But that's not coming true. And less than two weeks are left. He was in great anxiety about this. So he called all the spies and told them. Put redoubled effort. Put redoubled efforts. Within two weeks I want all of you. Somehow or the other. You have to find out where the Pandavas are. And we have to blow their disguise. We have to uncover their disguise. And we have to send them again into forest exile.

**Key Quote:** "In the Vedic times, every living entity who takes birth in a kingdom is called Praja."
**Summary:** The lecture describes the attack on Virata and the theft of cows, then transitions to a discussion of the king's duty in Vedic civilization to protect all living entities, not just humans.

So. The very next day. The allies of Duryodhana. They attacked the kingdom of Virata. They attacked the kingdom of Virata. And they started taking away his cows. They were at the outskirts of the city. And so the cows had come there for grazing. And the cows are like the citizens of the kingdom. Even the cows are supposed to be given special protection by the kings. In the Vedic civilization, elderly people, women, children, cows and the priestly class of people. These five classes of people had to be given special protection by the king under all circumstances. It was the duty of the king. Not like modern days. In modern days, the government thinks of protection only of the human citizens. They are not bothered about the animals who live in the kingdom. The animals are slain to the slaughterhouse and the human beings should be protected. This is the current day government's policy all over the world. But in the Vedic times, every living entity who takes birth in a kingdom is called Praja. Praja. Jayate. Jayate means to take birth. Whoever takes birth in the kingdom of Jayate. Whoever takes birth in the kingdom of Jayate. Whoever takes birth in the kingdom of Jayate. Quem is left morning, that Timelike. So, he is not allowed to take birth inside his kingdom. Safet Κhilep ruins. Father King. Foods are confiscated. It is important for visitors of the kingdom. So, the person who is allowed to take birth inside the kingdom ofда kingdom, is called the citizen of the kingdom. Singha. So even animals take birth within the kingdom, they also are considered citizens. Citizens in one respect? In respect of the receiving the, having the birth right to receive the protection from the king, from bodily harm and as well as for their welfare activity. Sure not? So it was the duty of the king to protect. Not only human beings but even animals.

**Summary:** Arjuna reveals himself as Brahmanala, leading to Duryodhana's elation due to the terms of the Game of Dice.

On the first day when the ally of Duryodhana attacked the kingdom of Virata, King Virata, accompanied by the four brothers, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva, managed to defeat them. And when they were planning to return to the kingdom of Virata the next early morning, Duryodhana and his party attacked the kingdom of Virata. On the other end, in response to which, King Virata's son Bhuminjaya, along with Brahmanala, went to counter that attack. Now that this Brahmanala was Arjuna was unknown to anyone, but Brahmanala revealed to Bhuminjaya when he was completely taken aback by the force of the Kaurava army. Brahmanala revealed to him that he was Arjuna himself. And then Bhuminjaya agreed to become his charioteer. And thus, Brahmanala retrieved the weapons of the Pandavas, which were hidden in the semi-tree next to the crematorium. Now, having retrieved his Gandiva bow, Arjuna sat on the chariot and he blew his conch shell, the Devadatta. By the sound of the conch shell itself and looking at the Gandiva bow, the Kauravas understood that this was Arjuna.

**Key Quote:** "And the whole purpose of Duryodhana coming to Virata was that only to uncover the disguise of the Pandavas."
**Summary:** Duryodhana is happy because he thinks the Pandavas will have to return to exile, while Karna boasts about defeating Arjuna.

Now that the disguise of the Pandavas was discovered, Duryodhana became very happy. And why? Because according to the conditions of the Game of Dice, if the Pandavas were discovered during their period of one year of living in incognito, then they would have to go again to the forest in exile for another 12 years. And the whole purpose of Duryodhana coming to Virata was that only: to uncover the disguise of the Pandavas. Now Duryodhana became very happy, and Karna also became very happy, and Bhishma and Dronacharya, they advised Duryodhana that it was unlikely that Arjuna would reveal himself unless the time for the period of their living in incognito was getting over. Duryodhana then told Bhishma Deva, "You please do a calculation and see what is the exact date on which their period of one year living in exile incognito is getting over." In the meantime, Karna started boasting. He told Duryodhana, "Why are you worrying, Duryodhana? The Pandavas have been living in the forest in exile for 12 years. By now, Arjuna would have become very weak, and even if this person who is standing in front of us is really Arjuna, don't worry, very easily with my arrows I'll finish him off today."

**Key Quote:** "Challenging Arjuna to battle if anyone who challenges Arjuna to battle he must really have gone off his senses."
**Summary:** Kripacharya warns Karna about Arjuna's power, and Ashwatthama criticizes Karna's lack of battlefield achievements.

When Kripacharya heard Karna boasting like this, he told Karna, "What are you talking about? Living in 12 years of exile in the forest, Arjuna and his brothers were not sitting idly. They were doing many austerities and penances, so they would have become all the more powerful. And as it is, we all know that Arjuna is far more powerful than you are." Then Kripacharya reminded him, "Look at when the Gandharvas attacked Duryodhana, it was Arjuna who defeated all of them and brought back Duryodhana." So at that time, Karna had got defeated. Karna got very angry. He said, "One instance like that, something happened, but today you will see my arrows will lay Arjuna down on the battlefield." Then he continued his boasting and he said, "Don't worry, come on, let us fight him." Kripacharya looked at him and he said, "You are talking of fighting Arjuna? You have gone mad. Challenging Arjuna to battle, if anyone who challenges Arjuna to battle, he must really have gone off his senses. It's like a man thinking of tying a heavy stone around his neck and trying to swim the ocean, not possible, the guy will drown, or it is like a man with his bare fingers trying to take out the poisonous fangs of a snake, it will only kill him. So like that, you are trying to rush into battle with Arjuna, you've gone off your head. Even if all six of us together, Bhishma, Dronacharya, myself, Kripacharya, Karna, you, Duryodhana, all of us together combined, if we fight against Arjuna, we may stand a slim chance, that also you cannot say with certainty where we may be able to counter Arjuna, but that also no guarantee, and you are saying that you want to fight him all by yourself?" When Ashwatthama heard this, he also jumped in. He said, "Karna, you are only used to boasting all the time. Where have you proven yourself in battle? Did you win the game of dice? In which fight with other kings did you win Draupadi, that you pulled her into the assembly and gave the great idea of disrobing

her in the middle of the assembly? In which battle did you ever fight the Pandavas and win? You have never really won any battle on ground and proven your words. You are simply going on boasting, that's it." Now Karna became very upset and insulted, but he wouldn't say anything because whatever Kripacharya was saying and whatever Ashwatthama was saying, both of them are actually correct. And then Bhishma Deva had to pacify everyone. And then Bhishma Deva spoke up and he said, "No, no, don't worry. Ashwatthama, Karna said like that so that we would all become enthused to fight against Arjuna. Otherwise, we are all talking only of Arjuna's prowess and we are not thinking of fighting him. So he wanted to encourage us and to inspire us to fight. He spoke those words, so don't take it too badly. Whatever you have spoken is correct, whatever Kripacharya spoke is also correct, but let us not insult or fight amongst ourselves." So then Dronacharya and Kripacharya also said, "Okay, whatever happened, let us now think of how to face the Arjuna who is standing before us." And then Bhishma told Duryodhana, "I've done my calculations. The one year of living incognito which the Pandavas had to complete got over yesterday, so today that is why Arjuna has revealed himself." Now Duryodhana, when

he heard this, he was mortified, but now there was nothing he could do. Then Dronacharya told Duryodhana, "Do one thing, you take all these cows which were belonging to the kingdom of Virata, you take them and you go. We will somehow try to stop Arjuna, so because Duryodhana is the prince and his life should not be put into danger." So the other Kaurava soldiers, the Kaurava army, Dushasana and other brothers of Duryodhana, Bhishma Dev, Dronacharya, Ashwatthama, Kripacharya, all these people took up their formations in the battle to face Arjuna because Arjuna had already blown his conch. And then Duryodhana, in the meantime, he started taking away the cows. Now Arjuna shot two arrows and those two arrows came and landed at the feet of Dronacharya and Bhishma Dev and Kripacharya. And then Dronacharya and Bhishma Dev looked at it and they said, "Arjuna is sending his respects, but now having submitted his respects, now he is not going to hold back, so let us get ready." So all of them got ready and in the meantime Arjuna saw how Duryodhana's chariot was moving away. Immediately he understood the plan of the Kauravas and he told Bhuminjaya, "Look, look, look, Duryodhana is trying to get away, let us go and corner him." So immediately Bhuminjaya, instead of going into the cover of army, took it off on a detour and cut off

Duryodhana. And Arjuna also used his arrows to quickly cut off Duryodhana. And Duryodhana did not have the courage to face Arjuna alone in battle. And when he saw that Arjuna's chariot was coming towards him, he dropped his plans of trying to get away all by himself. And he went back and joined the ranks of the Kauravas, thinking that, "I stand a better chance when I'm in the midst of Bhishma Dev and Dronacharya and Karna." And so the cows also, Duryodhana could not hold them back, and they all went back into the kingdom of Virata. So now the Virata kingdom's cows had been protected. Now Arjuna came back to the battlefield. And then Karna immediately jumped into the battle. And he started abusing Arjuna, saying that, "Oh, Arjuna, today you will see my arrows will wound you and they will kill you and you will lie on the battlefield," and so on and so forth, as Karna was usually always. He engaged in boasting. Similarly, he continued in the same way. Arjuna did not hold back. Arjuna started releasing his arrows. Karna also started releasing his arrows, and both of them engaged in a pitched battle. But gradually, Arjuna's superiority came to the fore. Slowly, Karna got wounded everywhere. His bow was broken. His arrows had pierced his arms, his thighs, his chest. And finally, he told his charioteer, "I cannot stand fighting Arjuna." So he had to run away from the battle. And then when Karna was beaten

back like this, then Dronacharya came forward. And when Dronacharya came forward, Arjuna told him that, "Oh, my guru, you are my guru. I will not take up a weapon against you unless you draw the weapon first." So Dronacharya smiled and he drew his bow and released his arrow. And when Dronacharya released his arrow, then Arjuna started counterattacking. So the fight went on between them, the guru and Arjuna. Dronacharya, of course, his full heart was not there in the battle, so he was not exerting himself fully. So very quickly, Arjuna managed to overpower him. And Dronacharya being hit by the arrows of Arjuna fainted. And when Dronacharya's charioteer saw that Dronacharya has fainted, he took him away from the battlefield. Now came forth Bhishmadeva, Arjuna. Now, between Bhishmadeva and Arjuna also, the fight started in good earnest. And because of the Kshatriya spirit, both of them were in a really angry mood and they were exchanging arrows. But again, even Bhishmadeva also could not face, he could not counter all of Arjuna's weapons. And Bhishmadeva also soon, he fell unconscious and his chariot also had to be taken away. Now, Karna had recuperated and he jumped back into the battle. And he came in front of Arjuna again, and again, he started fighting. But very quickly, again, he was defeated. Again, he had to run back from the battle. So like this, the battle between the Kaurava army and Arjuna went back and forth. And on this side, Arjuna was all alone. And on the other side, all these Maharashtris, the great generals, Kripacharya, Ashwatthama himself, Dronacharya, Bhishmadeva, all these people, Dushyasana, and

all these people fighting against Arjuna, but none of them were able to overpower him. Finally, Duryodhana himself came forward and started fighting. Now, Arjuna very quickly and very easily defeated Duryodhana, but he did not want to kill him because he remembered Bhima's vow to kill all of Duryodhana and his brothers. So he did not kill him, but he very quickly destroyed his bow and all his arrows. Everything got exhausted, and Duryodhana had also to retreat. So finally, when the entire Kaurava army was beaten back like this, the Kaurava army decided that we will not be able to face Arjuna, let us go back. And so all of them left the battlefield and went back to Hastinapura. So we can see how Arjuna was so powerful. All these warriors together could not face Arjuna in battle. But Arjuna did not pursue them. Arjuna, on the other hand, now that they had been defeated and they had left the kingdom of Virata, he collected all the, what it as the general practice used to be, he collected all the gold and the various ornaments of the dead soldiers who were lying on the battlefield and he gave it to Bhuminjaya and he told him that, "When we go back to the kingdom of Virata, don't tell anyone that I am Arjuna and I am the one who fought the battle and won it. You tell that you won it. At the right time, we will inform everyone who I am." Bhuminjaya agreed. He said, "Arjuna, you are my superior, whatever you command me, I will follow." So Brahmanala again occupied the post of the charioteer and Bhuminjaya sat on the chariot and both of them

And when King Virata heard that his son Bhuminjaya had gone all alone into the battle with the Kauravas with just the eunuch Brahmanala for his charioteer, he got alarmed. He said, "My poor son, what will we stand against the Kauravas? He'll be slaughtered." And he immediately readied his troops and he said, "Come, let us go immediately to save my son." By that time, messengers came and Bhuminjaya himself came to the court and he told Virata that the Kauravas had been defeated and they had gone back. And King Virata was extremely pleased and he was surprised, "Oh, my dear son Bhuminjaya, you are so powerful, you have defeated the Kauravas?" Then Bhuminjaya, now he could not tell that it was Arjuna who had fought because he had given his word, so he said, "No, no, no, I did not fight the battle. I actually, I wanted to run away from the battle, but suddenly when I was trying to flee from the battle, seeing the great strength of the Kaurava army and the powerful fighters like Bhishma, Drona, Duryodhana, Karna, and others, at that time a celestial being came and that celestial being, that devata, helped me to fight the Kauravas and it was that devata who actually defeated all the Kauravas." So then King Virata asked Bhuminjaya, "Where is that devata? Did you not bring him along with you?" Well, this hill is now being looted by the golemas. So Bhuminjaya said, "No, I don't know where he has gone. So I am unable to tell where he has gone. I don't know where he came from and where he went." Anyway, King Virata was very happy that now his kingdom had been protected and double celebration from two sides. The kingdom was attacked, but however, even the devata seemed to be helping King Virata and protecting himself, although Kichaka, who was his commander, was now no more.

**Summary:** The Pandavas reveal their true identities to King Virata, who is shocked and happy to have hosted them.

And like that, the evening was spent. The next day morning, King Virata came to the assembly and he sat down on his throne. And when he was sitting on his throne, suddenly he saw five young Kshatriyas clad in silk and wearing all gold ornaments walking into his assembly. And he saw, "These people seem to be familiar. Oh, this is Kanka and this is Vallabha, my cook, and there is Granthika and this is Tantripala, the guy who was taking care of my horses, and here is, looks like this person, somewhere I have seen this person, the fifth guy, I am not able to place him." Then he said that, "Arre Kanka, Vallaba, all of you, how come you are dressed like Kshatriyas and you are walking into my court in such a regal manner, not like the earlier way used to be?" And then they all introduced themselves and they said that King Yudhishthira introduced himself and he said, "I am Yudhishthira and we are all the Pandavas. So, and this is Bhima, this is Nakula, this is Sahadeva." Then Virata said, "Who is this other person?" "This is Arjuna who was here as Brihannala." Everybody in the court was taken by surprise. They were all shocked. And Virata said, "Oh my God, this one year you people have been staying here. Sir, always I used to think that somewhere I have seen you, but I couldn't place you. How could I ever not recognize you people? I just, I am not able to understand. Anyway, I am very happy that all of you were there here." And King Virata was a close friend of Yudhishthira. He respected the Pandavas a lot. And so he was very happy that the Pandavas had stayed with him for one year, although he had not recognized them. And then the Pandavas introduced Draupadi also. And they said, "This is Draupadi."

**Summary:** The Pandavas reveal Draupadi's identity and the story of Keechaka, and King Virata feels guilty for mistreating the Pandavas and offers his daughter Uttara in marriage to Arjuna.

Draupadi, she was here serving your wife, Queen Sudeshna, as the Sairindri maid servant. And then they also informed King Virata that Keechaka had lustfully approached Draupadi and it was Bhima who had killed Keechaka. Anyway, Keechaka was not such a great popular guy, and Virata also did not have such, he did not have great affection for him. But then out of necessity, out of helplessness, Keechaka had to tolerate him, so he didn't bother that Keechaka was no more. And on the other hand, King Virata was very happy with the Pandavas. And then he thought, "All you Pandavas, you are all highly glorified and exalted devotees of Krishna, but I have engaged you as servants in my palace, in my kingdom, so I feel very guilty." The Pandavas had no such feeling because the Pandavas themselves had wanted such a position to live incognito. So they were not, they had not taken it otherwise. But King Virata remembered all those instances during their relationships when he would order them to do this, do that, just like he would order any other servants. And so he felt guilty that he had mistreated the Pandavas. And so he said, he offered that my daughter Uttara, I want to give her in marriage to Arjuna.

**Summary:** Arjuna refuses to marry Uttara due to their guru-disciple relationship, demonstrating his unimpeachable character.

that my daughter Uttara, I want to give her in marriage to Arjuna. Now Arjuna immediately responded, "No, no, no, how can that be possible? I have been her teacher, so as a teacher, I am in the position of her father. I cannot marry her. And if I marry her today, people will speak ill of our relationship. We have had no illicit connection between ourselves till date and we have had just the very, very respectable relationship of a guru and a disciple because as Brahmanala, Arjuna was her guru for dance." And so Arjuna said, "But if you want to establish such family relationship with our dynasty, then I have a grown-up son, Abhimanyu, who is about 16 years old now. He is more or less of the same age as Uttara. If you want, we can marry both of them." Being Brahmanala was extremely happy and satisfied and he said, "Oh, this is a very nice proposal from your side and I am ready for this." So from this we can see the unimpeachable character of Arjuna. Although Uttara was offered to him, he saw her just as his own daughter, even though he had moved with her very intimately, taught her the art of dance, and in teaching of the art of dance, very close interactions would have been there, but his heart had entertained no

**Key Quote:** "And in this manner the marriage of Uttara and Abhimanyu was conducted in the kingdom of Virata."
**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the events of the previous episode, including the Pandavas' emergence from disguise, Arjuna's victory, and the marriage of Uttara and Abhimanyu, leading to a discussion about reclaiming Indraprastha.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to today's episode of the Mahabharata. In the last episode, we have seen how the Pandavas have come out of their living one year in the kingdom of Virata under disguise, incognito. And having completed their one year term, Brahman Nala revealed himself to be Arjuna to all the Kauravas who had come to attack the kingdom of Virata, and they were all defeated by Arjuna all alone, and they had to go back empty handed. And after that, we have seen the unimpeachable character of Arjuna when King Virata, coming to know of the real identity of the Pandavas, he offered his daughter Uttara in marriage to Arjuna. Arjuna, having been her teacher, very clearly said that he was in the role of her father, and he could not marry her, and instead, it was decided that Arjuna's son Abhimanyu will marry Uttara. And in this manner, the marriage of Uttara and Abhimanyu was conducted in the kingdom of Virata. And many people had come to attend it, even King Drupada had come, Krishna and Balarama had come. So like this, all of them had assembled there, and after the wedding celebrations, they all got together to discuss on the next steps to take back the kingdom of Indraprastha back from the Kauravas.

### Duryodhana, Shakuni, Deceit, Character

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana was always seeing how to not keep his promise and this was Duryodhana's natural, his evil-minded character"
**Summary:** The segment describes Duryodhana's reaction to the Pandavas' completion of their exile, Shakuni's attempt to manipulate the timeline, and Duryodhana's inherent deceitful nature.

So what their discussions led to is what we will look at today. Before we get there, what had happened after the Kauravas returned to Hastinapura? Duryodhana was despondent about how they had been defeated by Arjuna, and not only that, as told by Bhishma Deva, the period of the Pandavas living incognita had gotten over just the previous day, so they had by a whisker missed that opportunity to expose the disguise of the Pandavas, by which they could have been sent for another 12 years of forest exile. So while Dushasana, Karna, Shakuni, and Duryodhana, all these people were mulling over what had happened, Shakuni came up with a convoluted calculation by which he proved, or seemed to prove, that the Pandavas had actually not completed their one year of living incognito. So armed with this fresh explanation or twist given by Shakuni, Duryodhana got back a little bit of his confidence that there was some grounds on which they could reject giving back the Indraprastha kingdom to the Pandavas. So they knew that sooner or later, the Pandavas are going to come asking for their kingdom back, so we have some grounds to now refuse them. So like this, Duryodhana had already started preparing his mind as well as his followers about what should be the response and how to prevent giving back Indraprastha to the Pandavas. We can see how the Pandavas were always very steadfast in following whatever word of honour they had given, whereas Duryodhana was always seeing how to not keep his promise, and this was Duryodhana's natural, his evil-minded character.

**Summary:** The discussion among Krishna, Balarama, and others in Virata begins, with Krishna suggesting sending an emissary to demand the return of Indraprastha, warning of war if refused.

character, which was shared by Shakuni, Karna, and Dushasana and all his other brothers. Now when in the kingdom of Virata, when the Pandavas and Krishna and Balaram, Drupada and all these people assembled together, they started discussing on the next course of action. Lord Krishna, he spoke up and said that, we all know that Yudhishthira Maharaj is always situated in virtuosity. He will never abandon the path of virtue. Now that they have rightfully completed their term of 13 years in exile, 12 years in the forest and 1 year incognito, they have all the right to go back and get back their kingdom of Indraprastha. So we should send an emissary to ask for a return of the kingdom of Indraprastha to the Pandavas and the message should be clear that in case they refuse to give back the kingdom of Indraprastha to the Pandavas, then war would be inevitable.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Balarama, however, took an opposite approach and he said we should take a conciliatory approach."
**Summary:** Balarama advocates for a conciliatory approach, while Satyaki argues for readiness for war, highlighting the differing opinions within the assembly.

Now this, whatever Lord Krishna said, was echoed by others in the assembly. Lord Balarama, however, took an opposite approach and he said we should take a conciliatory approach. We should approach them humbly and if we go with an aggressive attitude, it may not be conducive. After all, ultimately, Yudhishthira Maharaj also made a mistake in playing the game of dice when he was not expert at it. So like this, Balarama gave an opposite view, which was countered by Satyaki, who was the commander-in-chief of Lord Krishna's army of the Yadavas. And he countered Balarama and he gave a more favorable argument for the Pandavas saying that Duryodhana's nature was such that we cannot expect him to return the kingdom, so we should be ready for war. So after all these back and forth discussions were going on, some were in favor of peace, some were in favor of approaching Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra in a humble mood, others were saying no, we should take a strong approach and all those kind of things. Finally, Drupada Maharaj spoke up and being an elderly person, being astute in the matters of political affairs, his word carried a lot of weight.

**Key Quote:** "So I suggest, Drupada said, I suggest that I have my priest who is a qualified Brahmana, very austere, lives very simply, is very truthful, very humble, so this kind of person if he send to the Duryodhana."
**Summary:** Drupada proposes sending a priest as a messenger to gauge the mood in Hastinapura before making any decisions, a suggestion that is agreed upon by the assembly.

So Drupada Maharaj said that I feel, I suggest that what we should do is, we should gauge the mood in Hastinapura. We should gauge the atmosphere. We should gauge the mood of Duryodhana as well as Dhritarashtra and others before we come to any conclusion about what is the next step we should take. Suppose by chance Duryodhana is agreeable to return the kingdom because of the influence of Vidura, Bhishma and all those things, then we have achieved our end. We don't have to create any hostilities. On the other hand, if Duryodhana continues his inimical attitude, then we have to take steps to assemble our people. We have to build up our army and all those things because Duryodhana is quite powerful. So we should start talking to our allies, we have to build up our army also. So unless we have, we know what is his mood, we will not be able to do, we will not be able to take the right decision. So I suggest, Drupada said, I suggest that I have my priest who is a qualified Brahmana, very austere, lives very simply, is very truthful, very humble, so this kind of person if he send to the Duryodhana. The assembly of Hastinapura, everyone will respectfully receive him and because he is very intelligent, he will be able to assess the mood of the people and give us the right pulse of what is happening there. Then when everybody heard this, everybody was in agreement with whatever Drupada said and they said, yes, what you are saying is absolutely right. Let us go ahead with this plan. Then Lord Krishna and Balarama informed the Pandavas as well as Drupada Maharaj. So you please go ahead with your plan. Whatever help you need. In case there is war, we are with you. So don't worry. So we will go back to Dwaraka and wait to hear what happened to the messenger going and coming back because for the messenger to go from the kingdom of Virata to Hastinapura, meet all the Kauravas there, come back with his message, it will all take time. So in the meantime, we will proceed to Dwaraka.

### Drupada, Purohit, Message, Strategy, Division

**Key Quote:** "So your goal in going there should be twofold. One is we should assess what is the mood in their camp?"
**Summary:** Drupada instructs his priest on how to deliver the message to the Kauravas, emphasizing the need to assess the situation and create dissension within their ranks if necessary.

Like this Krishna and Balarama left for Dwaraka and Drupada Maharaj called his priest, his Purohit and he spoke to him. He told him, see, this is what we want. You have to approach the Kauravas with a message from the Pandavas. Now this message, Drupada Maharaj using his worldly wise wisdom, he told the Purohit that we have to, how the message has to be positioned. So he told the Purohit, it is unlikely that Duryodhana will be agreeable to return the kingdom of the Pandavas. Then what is the point? What is the point in going there? So your goal in going there should be twofold. One is we should assess what is the mood in their camp? What steps are they taking? Are they preparing for war or are they remaining quite normal and peaceful? So that is one thing that you have to assess. Another thing that you have to also assess is that, another thing that you also have to achieve is that in case Duryodhana is refusing. If Duryodhana is refusing or Duryodhana is refusing is disagreeable to peace then you have to speak in such a way explaining how Dharma is on the side of the Pandavas so that people who are good people in that assembly of the Kauravas such as Bhishma, Drona, Kripacharya, Vidura, all these people, they will differ from the view of Duryodhana and so we would have created dissension in their camp, which will bring down their morale. So this is one of the age old myths. I will tell you later. About the Parachuram techniques of political craft, which Drupada Maharaj was using, Sama, Dama, Danda, Veda, if Sama, Dama, Danda doesn't work, you have to use Veda, if you create division in the camp of the enemy, you have broken his strength, so Drupada Maharaj advised his

**Key Quote:** "The Brahmana also mentioned to the assembly addressing Dhritarashtra that the Pandavas want peace."
**Summary:** The priest travels to Hastinapura, observes the military preparations, and delivers the Pandavas' message, emphasizing their desire for peace and the importance of Dharma.

Purohit, so these are the two things he had to achieve and sent him to the assembly of Hastinapura, this Brahmana, he travelled all the way to Hastinapura, took him quite a few days, he reached Hastinapura, when he reached Hastinapura, he noticed that Duryodhana had started assembling an army, he had started sending messages to his known people, his allies, his friends and started intimating them that we have to prepare for war with the Pandavas, so you send your army to Hastinapura and we have to start assembling an army, so we have to start building our forts, so the Brahmana could see that, okay, this, this thing is, this army is building up, so he made his way and entered the court of Hastinapura and when everybody came to know that he is a messenger coming from the kingdom of Virata and he is the Purohit of Drupada, he was well received, respectfully and after all suitable procedures had been completed, formalities had been completed with respect to his welcoming, they asked him what message he had brought. Now this priest, he started explaining how the Pandavas had been cheated in that game of dice, how against the principles of Dharma, Duryodhana, Karna and others had tried to disrobe Draupadi and by way of use of cheating methods, Yudhishthira was unwilling to participate in that game of dice. He was forced to participate and unrighteously he was defeated in the game of dice and sent on the, on, on, into the forest in exile. And now that the Pandavas had completed their term according to the, to the promise that they had given, now according to the principles of Dharma, Indraprastha has to be returned to the Pandavas, otherwise according to the principles of the Dharma, Pandavas will be left with no other option than to declare war.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "The Brahmana also mentioned to the assembly addressing Dhritarashtra that the Pandavas want peace."
**Summary:** The priest conveys the Pandavas' desire for peace, Bhishma supports the Pandavas' claim, while Karna vehemently opposes it, displaying his arrogance and defiance.

The Brahmana also mentioned that the Pandavas want peace. They are not interested in a war. That is not what they want. So therefore, please return the kingdom of Indraprastha and they will promise that they will forget all their past hostilities, whatever humiliation they have undergone, they will forget all that and live peacefully in cooperation with the Kaurava dynasty. Now, when the assembly heard this, then Bhishma Deva started speaking and Bhishma Deva said, yes, what you have said is absolutely right. Dharma is fully on the side of the Pandavas. Whatever they had to undergo due to the cheating and due to the evil machinations of Duryodhana and Karna and Shakuni and others, now the time has come that we should return Indraprastha and seek forgiveness from them. So, please return the kingdom of Indraprastha. And once again, he was talking about the power of Arjuna and his Gandiva as well as the power of Bhima's mace. So it would not behove us to engage in battle with them in any manner. We stand no chance in front of them. So, when Bhishma spoke these kind of words, Karna could not tolerated because Karna was always very arrogant and he had a he was very conceited he had a very high estimation. An unjustifiably high estimation of himself. So he got up and he started speaking very angrily. What are you talking, oh brahmana? What do you think of yourself? The point of us are coming from exile? What what do they think of themselves according to us there? They have not completed their term of the for the living incognito one year. So they should simply give up everything and go back to 12 years of forest exile. After that let them come back and request us and if Duryodhana is pleased he will return the kingdom to them. Otherwise the Duryodhana will not give them even an inch of land, forget it. We are not interested in giving anything.

**Key Quote:** "He told the brahmana that please take our message back to the Pandavas. We want peace"
**Summary:** Dhritarashtra responds to the priest, expressing a desire for peace but avoiding any commitment to return Indraprastha, revealing his ambiguous stance.

Like this Karna spoke up very strongly. When Karna spoke like this Dronacharya, Bhishma, they, Vidura, they all censured him, while Dushasana and others, they said, oh, what Karna has said is right and all these kind of things. Then Duryodhana spoke something, Dhritarashtra spoke something, finally Dhritarashtra gave the final verdict. He told the brahmana that please take our message back to the Pandavas. We want peace. We don't want war. So please tell them whatever is required for peace. Let us work cooperatively and let us achieve that. Let us not engage in any sort of hostility and also please tell them that if we engage in war, it is going to be only destruction of our own family. So let us not do this. So like this Dhritarashtra very tactfully he gave a message as if he is wanting peace, but he never gave a commitment that they will return Indraprastha and so like this the brahmana also understood what Dhritarashtra's mind was, what was the mood of Duryodhana, Karna and others and what was happening in Hastinapura and he returned back to the kingdom of Virata with the news. Now when he brought back the news, he told what exactly had happened and he told that the Dhritarashtra's message is that they want peace, but he has given no commitment of returning the kingdom of Indraprastha.

**Summary:** Drupada analyzes the information brought back by the priest, noting the discrepancy between Dhritarashtra's words and the military preparations, and advises the Pandavas to prepare for war and gather allies.

And he also explained what kind of army they were gathering and what kind of military preparations were going on in Hastinapura which he witnessed with on with his own eyes and Drupada also started gathering that information about the strength of the enemy army so Duryodhana was quite crafty and he was quite experienced so he had he achieved what he wanted to do he he wanted an estimation of the kind of military activity that was happening in Hastinapura and he managed to get what he wanted and so then he told the Pandavas see this although he Dhritarashtra is saying he wants peace, but the activity suggests otherwise so we should also not keep quiet. We should immediately start informing our allies and we should start getting people on our side. Let us immediately send out messengers from our side and ask our allies to come and join us. The Pandavas also agreed. Yes. This is a good strategy to adopt. We should not waste any more time and immediately Drupada started sending out messengers in different directions to those who are friendly to the Pandavas and they knew that they would join them in the in the fight of righteousness. In the meantime, Dhritarashtra also told one more thing to this brahmana. He told them please give us a little time. We will think over and give our final conclusion. We will the final message will send through one of our messengers after a little while. So the Pandavas also said okay while we assemble we are while we gather our military strength also, let us wait for the final messenger to come from the side of the dhritarashtra.

**Summary:** Dhritarashtra is in a dilemma, unable to go against Duryodhana's wishes, and decides to send Sanjaya with a message to the Pandavas, setting the stage for the next episode.

So they were waiting what Dhritarashtra would do. The dhritarashtra thought over for some time. He consulted Vidura. He consulted Bhishma. They were all naturally in favor of the Pandavas and telling him to return the kingdom of Indraprastha to the Pandavas, whereas Duryodhana was totally against it. Duryodhana was not interested in giving back anything. Duryodhana was sticking to his stand that the Pandavas have not completed their one year of living incognito, so they have to go back to their 12 year of exile. So he was, Duryodhana continued to be unreasonable and Dhritarashtra did not have the guts. He did not have the courage to go against Duryodhana. So he was being overwhelmed by what Duryodhana was saying. At the same time, Dhritarashtra knew that although Karna was so boasting and all those kind of things, Karna was not going to be able to protect Duryodhana. Although Duryodhana also had great faith in Karna's prowess, but Dhritarashtra had a good, good idea. He had a proper understanding of the reality and he knew that if there was a war, all his sons would be killed. So now what to do? He was, Dhritarashtra was in a dilemma. He could not go against his son Duryodhana and return the kingdom to the Pandavas in which case the war could be fully averted. At the same time, he did not want the war. Now what to do? So he thought of sending Sanjaya with a message to the Pandavas who were living in Virata. Now, what was that message which Dhritarashtra sent through Sanjaya and what was the response of the Pandavas to this? Please join us in our next episode to know about this. Thank you. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, highlighting Duryodhana's refusal to return Indraprastha, Shakuni's calculations, and Dhritarashtra's attempt to broker peace through Sanjaya.

Hare Krishna. In the last episode of the Mahabharata, we have seen how Drupada Maharaj sent his priest as a messenger to Hastinapura to convey their intent and requesting the Kauravas to return Indraprastha to the Pandavas, while also assessing what was the mood of the Kauravas and what all preparations they were undertaking. And we also saw how the Kauravas were completely against returning the kingdom to Indraprastha. Duryodhana, being the envious, greedy person that he was, he had no intention of returning the kingdom. Shakuni had made his own calculations, some convoluted calculations he had done to convince others that the Pandavas had not yet completed their term of exile, living incognito, before they were discovered. And on that basis, they should be asked to go back for another 12 years of forest exile. Although in reality, just as Bhishma Dev had done his calculations, the Pandavas had completed their exile period successfully. Then after this, Dhritarashtra thought of sending Sanjaya, who was his charioteer and his personal secretary, to the Pandavas with a message which he, after hearing out Duryodhana and understanding his intentions, that he did not want to return the kingdom of Indraprastha. So Dhritarashtra wanted to send a message which would not be hostile, which would not incite war, but at the same time somehow broker peace. That was Dhritarashtra's thinking. So what did Sanjaya convey to the Pandavas? What was the message he took to them? What was their reaction?

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana had already started intimating his allies, gathering different armies, and he was building up his army very well aware that his refusal to return Indraprastha to the Pandavas, which was rightfully theirs, would inevitably result in war."
**Summary:** The segment describes Krishna and Balarama's return to Dwaraka, Duryodhana's awareness of the impending war, and his plan to seek the support of the invincible Yadava army.

Is what we will see today. In the meantime, what had happened was, when after the marriage of Uttara and Abhimanyu, when all the kings had got together and they were strategizing what should be the next steps to be taken, and they finally decided to send Drupada's priest to Hastinapura to seek a return of the Pandavas' kingdom, Lord Krishna and Balarama had returned to Dwaraka, giving confidence to the Pandavas that whenever they would be needed, they would be there. This news that Krishna had returned to Dwaraka reached Hastinapura. Now Duryodhana had already started intimating his allies, gathering different armies, and he was building up his army very well aware that his refusal to return Indraprastha to the Pandavas, which was rightfully theirs, would inevitably result in war. Now the Yadava Sainya, which was called Narayani Sainya, it was known to be an army which was invincible. The Narayani Sena of Krishna had defeated Jarasandha innumerable number of times. They had defeated Shalva, and many such battles had been very easily won by the Narayani Sena. And all over the world, everybody knew that the Yadava army was practically invincible. Now it was Duryodhana also knew that Krishna always was favorable towards the Pandavas. So he thought, let me quickly go to Dwaraka and seek the support of the Yadava army. While to all other allies, Duryodhana had sent his different emissaries to seek the support of the different kings. When it came to the Yadava army, because it was so important, Duryodhana personally went to Dwaraka.

### Duryodhana's arrival at Dwaraka, Krishna's influence, Arjuna's arrival

**Key Quote:** "Although Ugrasena was the king of the Yadavas, still Krishna's word was always considered final."
**Summary:** Duryodhana arrives in Dwaraka seeking Krishna's support, knowing Krishna's influence over the Yadavas, and coincidentally meets Arjuna who has come for the same reason.

Duryodhana came to Dwaraka and he informed the people there that he had come to meet Lord Krishna because he knew, although Ugrasena was the king of the Yadavas, still Krishna's word was always considered final in the Yadava assembly. So he thought it is wise to meet Krishna and if he seeks Krishna's support and Krishna agrees, then all the rest of the entire Yadava clan would definitely support him. So with this intention, Duryodhana had come to Dwaraka. In the meantime, what had happened is, before Duryodhana came to Dwaraka, Satyaki, one of the commander-in-chiefs of the Yadava army, he was a disciple of Arjuna. He had learnt the art of archery from Arjuna himself and he was always very much in favour of the Pandavas because of their righteousness. Satyaki, without waiting for an invitation from the Pandavas, took one Akshauhini, one division of army and went to Virata, the kingdom of Virata and he joined the Pandavas. Now the rest of the Yadava clan was still in Dwaraka by the time Duryodhana had reached Dwaraka and now when Duryodhana came and sought audience with Krishna, he was told that Krishna was taking rest within his chambers and so he was escorted, Duryodhana was escorted towards Krishna's chambers. Because Duryodhana, the entire Kaurava dynasty were closely related with the Yadava dynasty because Kunti Devi was from the Yadava dynasty and therefore she was the aunt of Lord Krishna and that way the relationship was quite thick between the Yadava household and the Kaurava household. So therefore, Duryodhana had access to Krishna's private chambers. When Duryodhana arrived, it so happened that Krishna was actually resting. He was sleeping in his inner chambers and because he was a close family member, he was escorted to Krishna's bedroom. As Duryodhana was entering Krishna's bedroom, he saw there was one more visitor who had arrived at the same time. It was none other than Arjuna. Arjuna had also come seeking the support of Krishna practically at the same time. Now Duryodhana and Arjuna saw each other, they greeted each other and Duryodhana entered first into Krishna's chamber because he had come first and also he was the elder one, Arjuna was younger. Giving due respect according to his age, Arjuna followed Duryodhana into the chamber.

### Krishna's diplomacy, Arjuna's devotion, Duryodhana's ambition

**Key Quote:** "You came here first. But when I opened my eyes, the first person I saw was Arjuna."
**Summary:** Krishna, upon waking, greets both Duryodhana and Arjuna and offers them a choice: himself unarmed or his entire Narayani Sena, giving Arjuna the first opportunity to choose.

As soon as Duryodhana entered, he saw Krishna lying on the bedstead and next to Krishna near his head was a small chair. Duryodhana went and sat there at Krishna's head waiting for him to wake up. Arjuna in the meantime, he also entered and he saw Krishna is sleeping and he went and stood very respectfully at the lotus feet of Krishna. Arjuna, he is a great devotee of Lord Krishna, and for him his heart is filled with love for Krishna. Yes, he understands the great position of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So he felt it appropriate to stand at the lotus feet of Krishna. And both Duryodhana and Arjuna were silently waiting, not wanting to disturb the sleep of Krishna. After a little while, Krishna slowly opened his eyes. And when Krishna opened his eyes, he saw Arjuna standing at his feet. And then slowly Krishna raised himself up and he said, Oh Arjuna, you have come here. And then when Krishna got up and sat up on his bed, he saw Duryodhana is sitting next to him. And he said, Oh Duryodhana, you have also come. Then Krishna greeted both of them warmly and he asked them, Why have you both come at the same time together? At the same time to meet me? Then Duryodhana replied to Krishna and he said, Oh my dear Krishna, we both have come here seeking your support and the support of your Yadava army for any eventuality of any war that may take place between us. And you are related to the Kaurava dynasty. So you are equally related to me as well as to the Pandavas. Therefore, you should be equal to both of us. And since I have come here first, therefore I have the right to first ask your support. Lord Krishna replied to Duryodhana, My dear Duryodhana, I agree what you have said is right. You came here first. But when I opened my eyes, the first person I saw was Arjuna. Not only that, Arjuna is younger to you by age. And according to the Vedic scriptures, according to Dharma, the younger person is always given the first opportunity. And so therefore, I give Arjuna the opportunity to seek my support. But at the same time, what you have said is right, Duryodhana, that I am related equally to both of you. This is a family quarrel. And so, what I will do is, on one side, I present myself unarmed. I will not take up arms in the battle. I will not fight in the battle. But I will be there giving good advice and support. Moral support and advice will be there from my side. On the other hand, my entire Narayani Sena, the Yadavasanya will be available. So between the two of you, you can choose one of these two. And Arjuna, I give you the first opportunity.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna, doesn't matter that you don't lift arms, you don't do any activity, you just be by my side. That's enough for me."
**Summary:** Arjuna chooses Krishna over the army, expressing his deep devotion and prioritizing Krishna's presence above all else.

Please choose whom you want. Arjuna, without batting an eyelid, without hesitation, immediately said, Krishna, doesn't matter that you don't lift arms, you don't do any activity, you just be by my side. That's enough for me. Krishna said, okay, as you wish. Then he turned to Duryodhana and he said, Arjuna has chosen me. So I am afraid that you have to be satisfied with the Narayana. So I am afraid that you have to be satisfied with the Narayani Sena. Duryodhana, internally, was delighted. He had thought that oh, Arjuna has got the first right, he will choose the Narayani Sena and I will be left with Krishna who is anyway not going to lift weapons. What is the point of having him then anyway on our side? Duryodhana was elated that Arjuna had made the foolish decision. And he thought, good, Arjuna has somehow, by some fluke, Arjuna has chosen wrongly. So Duryodhana, but externally, he was a greatly diplomatic person. He maintained a very calm exterior and neutral countenance he maintained. And he said, I think I don't have a choice now. Arjuna has already chosen, you have given him the first right. So I have to be satisfied with your Narayani Sena. Okay, all right. I'll be satisfied with that. Okay, thank you both of you. I'm leaving. And he said, he got up and he walked out. Now when Duryodhana walked out, Krishna looked at Arjuna and he said, Arjuna, I said, I will be, I will not take up arms. Then why did you choose me? You should have taken the army. The entire Yadava army was at your disposal. Arjuna immediately said, Oh Krishna, you are the supreme personality of Godhead. Wherever you are there, Lakshmi Devi is also there. That means all opulence is also there. All victory is also there. I am not bothered about winning or losing this battle. I want you. You are the person whom I want. You are the goal of my life. So I don't want anything else. Everything else is secondary. If you are there with me, for me, everything else is achieved.

### Krishna's reciprocation, Lord's love for devotees, Krishna as charioteer

**Key Quote:** "Although Krishna is the supreme person, he is the master of everyone, still Krishna loves to become subordinate to the commands of his devotee."
**Summary:** Krishna, overwhelmed by Arjuna's love, agrees to become his charioteer, illustrating the loving relationship between the Lord and his devotees.

So Krishna was overwhelmed by this love from Arjuna. And he said, and he told Arjuna, Arjuna, I am, I am indebted to you for the love you have shown me. So please tell me how I can help you in this battle. Then Arjuna told Krishna that Krishna has a great desire. I want you to be my charioteer in this battle. Krishna readily agreed. He said, is that all? Definitely I'll be your charioteer. You can see Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. Krishna's lotus feet are worshipped even by Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma. All the devatas are waiting for an opportunity to have darshan of the lotus feet of Krishna. Krishna is such an exalted personality. He is the supreme personality of Godhead. There is nobody equal to him, nobody above him. Such is the greatness of Krishna. He is bhoktaram yajna tapasam sarva loka mahishuram. All the universes, all the planetary systems are emanating from Krishna. Krishna is the supreme creator. And therefore everything belongs to him. And all the ajnas, all the sacrifices, all the Vedas are meant for pleasing Krishna. And that Krishna is agreeing to become the charioteer of Arjuna, his devotee. These are the loving dealings between the Lord, between Lord Krishna, the supreme personality of Godhead, and his devotees. Although Krishna is the supreme person, he is the master of everyone. Still Krishna loves to become subordinate to the commands of his devotee. Just like how Krishna subjugated himself to the love of Yashodhamai and agreed to be bound by her to that martyr. Although he cannot be bound by any material rope, still he was bound by the love of Yashodhamai. Similarly, Krishna was bound by the love of Arjuna and he agreed to take orders from Arjuna by becoming his charioteer.

### Balarama, Duryodhana's persistence, Krishna's expansions, Anandamayo Abhyasat

**Key Quote:** "Anandamayo Abhyasat by nature, the supreme lord being a person, he desires to enjoy."
**Summary:** Duryodhana, not giving up, approaches Balarama for support, while the speaker explains the concept of Krishna's expansions for the purpose of enjoyment and relationship.

In the meantime, Duryodhana had still not given up. His mind was constantly working. He thought, okay, let's refuse to partake in the battle. But what about Balarama? He is the next most powerful personality. While Arjuna and Krishna were discussing like this, Duryodhana had left Krishna's room and he had gone to approach Balarama. The added advantage for Duryodhana with Balarama was Balarama was his guru as far as learning the art of fighting with the gatha, with the mace was concerned. So Duryodhana already had a good relationship with Balarama. And very quickly he approached Balarama before Arjuna could approach. And Duryodhana approached Balarama and he told him that like this, I have come here seeking your support and I approached Lord Krishna also. But Krishna has agreed to become, he told that he would decide, he would divide the Narayani Sena and himself. One side he will be there without arms and the other side will be his army. And Arjuna chose Krishna. Now I have come to you seeking your support. Now Duryodhana did not know the actual position of Balarama. Actually Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. Now it is stated in the Vedas that Anandamayo Abhyasat by nature, the supreme lord being a person, he desires to enjoy. And when he desires to enjoy, what does he do? Just like in this material world, whenever we want to enjoy, what do we do? We enter into relationships with other individuals. We enjoy in relationship with our families and with our friends and relatives etc. We do not enjoy if we are all alone. If we have got something nice to eat, then we want to call a few friends and we want to share it with them. If we want to watch a movie, we want to go with our family. If we want to go on a vacation, we want to take our wives and children along with us. This is the nature of a person, of an individual person. This nature of human beings is actually a result of being of the individual nature. Being a part and parcel of the supreme lord. Because the supreme lord has a propensity to enjoy in relationship with others, we being emanations, we being part and parcel of that supreme lord, we also have, we also possess similar propensity

### Balarama's devotion to Krishna, Balarama's refusal, Duryodhana's disappointment

**Key Quote:** "I cannot even dream of opposing Krishna in any manner."
**Summary:** Balarama refuses to support Duryodhana, stating he cannot oppose Krishna and decides to go on pilgrimage, leaving Duryodhana disappointed.

to enjoy with other individuals. Now, Krishna when he desires to enjoy, he expands himself. He is not dependent upon individuals other than himself to enjoy. He expands himself into other personalities. He expands himself into first as Balarama. And that Balarama further expands into the Chaturvyuha expansion of Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha. And from that Sankarsana again expands Narayana. From that Narayana, the second quadruple expansion of Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha come out. And from that second Sankarsana come the Vishnu avataras within this material world. So like this, the lord expands himself into innumerable forms of the Vishnu tattva as well as his incarnation. And the lord also expands himself into his devotees. And then the lord expands himself into all the living entities that we all are. And so like this, the lord expands himself into unlimited forms to engage in wonderful loving relationships with different individuals. Now Balarama is the first expansion of Krishna. And he is imbued with love for Krishna. When the lord descended as Ramachandra, the same Balarama descended as Lakshmana. And in the past times of Lord Ramachandra, Lord Ramachandra had to undergo so much difficulty. And Lakshmana being a younger brother, many times he had great desire to partake, to express his anguish whenever he saw Lord Ramachandra suffering. But he could not express because he was a younger brother and he was inhibited by that subordinate position. So when the Supreme Lord Krishna personally descended in this world, Balarama came as his elder brother so that he could express his anguish whenever Krishna would feel any sort of distress. And also Balarama could play a protective role and prevent anybody from causing any harm or distress to Krishna. So Balarama is very very possessive of Krishna and he will not think of doing anything other than what Krishna likes. The moment when Balarama heard that Krishna has already given himself to the Pandavas, Balarama told Duryodhana, I cannot even dream of opposing Krishna in any manner. And because this is a family quarrel, I will not participate in this. Let Krishna give support to the Pandavas. I am giving up my Kshatriya Dharma. I am retiring from this Kshatriya duties of fighting and engaging in battle and all these kind of things. I am going on Teertha Yatra. Balarama decided to go on pilgrimage. And so Duryodhana thought, okay, anyway Balarama did not come to my side, but he is not going to fight on the side of the Pandavas also. So there is no loss. Then he said, okay, fine, alright. If you don't want to fight, no problem.

**Key Quote:** "Dhritarashtra, King Dhritarashtra wants peace."
**Summary:** Sanjaya arrives with Dhritarashtra's message of peace, but Yudhishthira insists on the return of Indraprastha as a condition for peace.

And Duryodhana went back to Hastinapura. And in this manner, Krishna became the charioteer of Arjuna. And now Arjuna took Krishna with him and went back to the kingdom of Virata for further consultation and seeking Krishna's advice on what they should do next. After Krishna and Arjuna had reached the kingdom of Virata, they came to know that Sanjaya has come there, bringing the message of Dhritarashtra. The Pandavas, they all assembled and they called forth Sanjaya. Sanjaya came there. After receiving all the welcoming hospitality, Sanjaya came forward into that assembly and Yudhishthira Maharaj received him very warmly because the Pandavas knew Sanjaya for a long time. And Sanjaya had also been always very favorable towards the Pandavas. Although he was the secretary of Dhritarashtra, he knew that the Pandavas were righteous and he was always favorable to them. This Sanjaya came before the Pandavas and Yudhishthira Maharaj asked about the welfare of all the senior people in the Kaurava household like Bhishma Dev, Dronacharya, Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, etc. And Sanjaya also told Yudhishthira and the Pandavas that they were all doing well and that he has brought a message from Dhritarashtra. Yudhishthira Maharaj said, please go ahead, please let us know what message you are bringing from Dhritarashtra. Then Sanjaya told Yudhishthira that Dhritarashtra, King Dhritarashtra wants peace. He does not want any kind of fighting, infighting. And he has said that he is ready to consider all options to avoid any kind of war or any kind of skirmish, and let us peacefully settle the matter. And he has also said that there is no point in fighting, infighting between the family members. If the family members kill each other, then what are we achieving? We are not achieving anything. It is not good for either party. So let us avoid fighting. This is the message.

**Key Quote:** "Duty of a Kshatriya is to fight or not in the face of injustice."
**Summary:** Sanjaya questions Yudhishthira's inclination towards war, prompting Yudhishthira to defend his position as a Kshatriya upholding Dharma, and seeking Krishna's judgment.

So Yudhishthira replied to Sanjaya, See, if you want peace, the solution is very simple. Return Indraprastha to us. Matter will be settled. I assure you that we will forget all animosity, whatever the Kauravas, they have insulted us, whatever humiliation they have done towards us, how they cheated us in the game of dice, we will forget all that and we will live as friends. I assure you this. On the other hand, if you do not hand over Indraprastha to us, then we are not sitting here idly. Arjuna is having the Gandiva in his hand and Bhima is having his Gada in his hand and you will have to reply to these two people and no force in this world can withstand the force of these two weapons of my brothers. When Sanjaya heard this, he was surprised. He said, Yudhishthira, how is it that you are so much inclined to war? You should be thinking of how to get peace. A righteous person is never inclined towards war and to quarrel and such things. He should always think of how to maintain peace and harmony in the society because wars always bring untold suffering to humanity. Everyone knows this. So how is it that you are behaving like this adharmically? When Sanjaya said this, Yudhishthira said that you please first consider what is the duty of a Kshatriya. Duty of a Kshatriya is to fight or not in the face of injustice. In the face of injustice, is a Kshatriya supposed to keep quiet? And what is happening with us here? Is it just or is it unjust? So on whose side is Dharma? You please consider this. And then Yudhishthira Maharaj turned to Krishna and he said, Lord Krishna, you decide whether what I am saying is right or wrong. You please tell us whether I am wrong in expressing that in case the kingdom is not given, there has to be war. Am I a war mongering person? Am I going against the principles of Dharma? Then Sanjaya also looked towards Krishna because Sanjaya also knew that Krishna is the Supreme Lord. Krishna responded that Yudhishthira, whatever you have said is perfectly according to the codes of Dharma. You have always lived righteously and your demand for the return of your kingdom is also righteous. And Sanjaya suddenly, everybody could see Krishna's face becoming very grave and they could sense Krishna's rising anger.

### Krishna's anger, Injustice, Draupadi's disrobing, Dharma and Adharma

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Now what right do you have to speak of Dharma?"
**Summary:** Krishna expresses his anger, reminding Sanjaya of the injustices suffered by the Pandavas, particularly the disrobing of Draupadi, and condemning the Kauravas' actions.

Krishna said, Sanjaya, how did the Kauravas get hold of Indraprastha? Do you remember? They cheated Yudhishthira Maharaj in that game of dice. Although Yudhishthira Maharaj was saying in that assembly that he did not wish to play that game of dice, still he was goaded into playing that game of dice. Although he was not so keen on playing that game of dice, unfairly Duryodhana made Shakuni his partner and he cheated Yudhishthira of his kingdom, of his brothers and his wife. And when Yudhishthira had lost his kingdom, at that point of time, what were you all doing? You were all sitting in the assembly keeping quiet? You did not stop? What was going on? The game of cheating dice? And then what happened? Draupadi was pulled into that assembly and she was attempted to be disrobed. When her honour was being violated, which person in that assembly stood up and spoke? Except for Vikarna. Did Bhishma oppose it? Did Drona oppose it? You were also there. Did you oppose it? So at that time, you did not think of Dharma. Now what right do you have to speak of Dharma? You have no right to talk about what is right and what is wrong. You have no right to talk about Dharma and Adharma. Forget it. You keep it aside. Whatever the kingdom has been taken by force by the Kauravas has to be returned. Otherwise there will be war and Duryodhana and all his brothers will bite the dust. So Krishna's anger was something which was unexpected. And everybody was taken aback, including Sanjaya. But Sanjaya also felt ashamed because whatever Krishna had said was true. In that assembly, Dushyasana was trying to disrobe Draupadi. When Karna was inciting Duryodhana to drag Draupadi into that assembly, none of them had opposed. Sanjaya had not opposed. Sanjaya had kept quiet. This was wrong on his part. Sanjaya accepted that. So he bowed his head and kept quiet. So finally, after little more discussion like this, Sanjaya asked the Pandavas, Please give me your message.

### Pandavas' message, Peace, Five villages, Bhima's response

**Key Quote:** "Our message is very simple. Please hand over Indraprastha, which is rightfully ours, back to us."
**Summary:** The Pandavas reiterate their message, demanding the return of Indraprastha or at least five villages, with Bhima surprisingly advocating for peace.

What is the message I have to give to Dhritarashtra? Yudhishthir Maharaj told him, Our message is very simple. Please hand over Indraprastha, which is rightfully ours, back to us. We will forget all hostility and we will live as friends and brothers. On the other hand, if you wish to, if you do not give the kingdom back to us, then there has to be war. And even if you give five villages, one for each of five brothers, we are ready to even accept that because we are Kshatriyas. Our duty is to rule. As long as we have got a place to rule and some citizens to administer, then we have no issues. We are ready even for that. This is our message. And then Krishna spoke to Arjuna. Krishna asked Arjuna, Arjuna, what is your response? And Arjuna responded, He said, Whatever my brother Yudhishthir Maharaj has said is fully right and I stand fully with him. If the Kauravas are ready to give back Indraprastha, we will maintain peace. Otherwise, my Gandiva will speak. We will not speak anymore. Then Krishna looked at Bhima and he said, Bhima, what do you have to say? Now what was Bhima's response? Normally, we would expect Bhima to be the most angry of the lot and the person who was most thirsting for revenge. Surprisingly, Bhima spoke very peacefully and Bhima said, My dear Sanjaya, we want peace. We don't want any fight. Please tell Dhritarashtra that somehow please convince Duryodhana to give us at least five villages. We are happy with that. We don't want any fight. We don't want any battle. Why we should fight and kill each other unnecessarily? If we on one side and you Kauravas with Bhishma, Drona and all on the other side fight, what is the result which is going to happen? We will simply kill each other. I don't want to see such bloodshed. Let us avoid all this. Let us maintain peace.

**Summary:** Bhima clarifies his desire for peace stems from compassion, but reaffirms his vow for revenge, prompting Krishna's laughter, and the lecture concludes with a promise of the next episode.

Krishna was surprised and Krishna started laughing. Krishna said, What is it that I am hearing Bhima? Looks like you have become afraid when the time for battle has come. What happened to all those words of revenge and all those things you were speaking? Then Bhima became very grave and he said, Krishna, it is not that I have become afraid. I was feeling compassionate towards the Kauravas because if there is battle, definitely they will be killed. And I thought, why they have to go through all this pain and Dhritarashtra and Gandhari will have to suffer seeing their sons killed before them. So I was being compassionate and thought, let us avoid it. But otherwise I am not afraid. I am waiting for battle. Let the Kaurava brothers come. I am waiting to fulfill my vow. I have vowed to kill Dushyasana and rip his heart out and drink his blood. I am waiting for the battle to happen between both of us. So Krishna smiled and said, and he said, This is the Bhima we know. Fine. So like this, everybody's message was given and Sanjaya started back to Hastinapura. And when he reached Hastinapura and how was the message from the Pandavas received? What was the reaction in the Kaurava? What was the reaction in the Kaurava palace? Please join us in the next episode to know about this. Thank you for joining us today. Hare Krishna. Jagat Guru Shri La Pravupada Ki Jai Netai Gor Prem Anandae

**Summary:** The speaker summarizes the previous episode, focusing on Arjuna and Duryodhana seeking Krishna's support and Sanjaya's unsuccessful peace mission.

Hare Krishna and welcome back to this episode of the Mahabharata. In the previous episode, we have seen how Duryodhana and Arjuna approached Krishna for his support. Arjuna chose to have Krishna who would be beside the Pandavas. Arjuna was helping them, assisting them in the battle but unarmed, and Duryodhana got the Yadava army, and Balarama decided to go on pilgrimage, not wishing to take part with either of the family members. And then we also saw how Sanjaya brought Dhritarashtra's message to the Pandavas with actually no concrete proposal, just asking for peace and nothing more. He was not offering the kingdom back to the Pandavas, and the Pandavas gave their response and sent Sanjaya back.

**Key Quote:** "Duryodhana smiled slyly this was a cunning arrangement from him to make Shalya indebted so that he could seek his support"
**Summary:** The story of King Shalya being tricked by Duryodhana's hospitality into fighting for the Kauravas is narrated, highlighting the importance of keeping one's word of honor.

Now, how was Sanjaya received in the Kaurava palace? That is what we will see today. Before that, when the message was reaching all the kings all over the world about the impending battle between Pandavas and Kauravas, in the kingdom of Madhra, Madhra Desha, there was the king who was known as Shalya. He was the son of Somadatta and his brother was Burishtaba. His sister was Madhri, and Madhri, as we know, was married to Pandu. When the message of this impending fight between the Pandavas and Kauravas reached Madhra Desha, Shalya wanted to support the Pandavas naturally because they were his sister's sons, and so he took his army and set out to the kingdom of Virata. Now, when Shalya was taking his army and proceeding towards the kingdom of Virata, he found that all along the way there had been many nice encampments created for him and his soldiers to rest during the nights. They would travel during the day, and during the night they would set camp somewhere along the way, and wherever they were supposed to put camp, already tents were arranged, various arrangements were made for their food and for their secure resting during the night, and good drinking water was made available, clean water for their clothing, for their bathing, and for washing their clothes. All these arrangements were made. Shalya was very happy when he saw this. He was pleasantly surprised. So as they approached the kingdom of Virata, at every stage he found wonderful arrangements were made. Shalya was very happy. He was thinking that the Pandavas, knowing that I am coming to them for supporting them, have made such wonderful arrangements. Yudhishthira is really very grateful and kind. And when they were close to the kingdom of Virata, Shalya, being so happy with all the arrangements because it took him so many days to come from Madhurdesha till here, he could not contain himself, and he was saying, "Where is Yudhishthira? I really want to meet him. I cannot wait till I reach the kingdom of Virata to meet him. He has made such wonderful arrangements. I am really obliged to him." Please, he spoke to the servants who had been deployed there for taking care of the hospitality of King Shalya and all his retinue. He told them, "Please go and call Yudhishthira. I want to meet them." These servants started looking at each other and with a puzzled look they stepped out of the camp and they started talking to each other. "Shalya is talking of Yudhishthira, what is this? All these arrangements have been made by Duryodhana." So anyway, let us go and convey to Duryodhana. They went and conveyed like this to Duryodhana, "Like this, Shalya is really obliged, but he is thinking Yudhishthira has made all these arrangements and he wants to meet you to thank you and expresses indebtedness." Duryodhana smiled slyly. This was a cunning arrangement from him to make Shalya indebted so that he could seek his support. So in a cunning way, he wanted to divert Shalya to his camp, and now Duryodhana, now that he knew Shalya had taken all his hospitality and he was now indebted to him, Duryodhana came before him, and Shalya, when he saw Duryodhana, he was taken aback, and he said, "Duryodhana, what are you doing here?" Duryodhana said, "I am the one who have made all the arrangements for you and I have taken care of all your hospitality en route so that you don't have any difficulty in your travel." See how cunning Duryodhana is. Now Shalya felt trapped. To his nephews, but he landed up with Duryodhana, and he said, "Okay, Duryodhana, I have taken all your hospitality, so I am indebted to you. Now you please tell me whatever you want. I am ready to give. I cannot go back on my... this is my word of honor because it is... it is for a respectable man, if he has taken somebody's hospitality, he has to fulfill his obligation towards the host." Duryodhana then said, "I want you and your army to fight with me whenever we have to fight with the Pandavas." Now Shalya was in a fix. He said, "Duryodhana, what to do? I understand what you have done now, but now it's too late. I have also, without thinking, without asking, I enjoyed all the hospitality you have given me, so I'm obliged to... I'll keep my word of honor. I am a man of my word of honor, so I will, since you have asked me, I cannot refuse. I will fight on your side."

**Summary:** Yudhishthira's magnanimous nature is discussed, emphasizing his commitment to Dharma over personal gain, which made him dear to great personalities.

Duryodhana was extremely happy his ploy had worked. He had cheated Shalya into joining him because Shalya was a powerful king, and he had, in effect, what had happened? Shalya had come with a certain army, now that much army was lesser in the Pandavas, that much was more in the Kauravas army. So then Duryodhana said, "Very fantastic, now I request you please come with me to Hastinapura." Shalya replied, "I will come to Hastinapura anyway. I was going to the kingdom of Virata. I want to meet my nephews. I will meet them. Then I will come to Hastinapura." And so then Duryodhana went back to Hastinapura. King Shalya proceeded to the kingdom of Virata. There he met Yudhishthira Maharaj and he explained to him what all had happened. And Yudhishthira Maharaj, when he heard everything, he told King Shalya, "My dear uncle, I feel that whatever you have done is the right thing. You should keep your word of honor. Although your support for us was invaluable, still your word of honor, the promise you have made is far more important. So you have done the right thing. Without any feeling of ill will, you may please proceed and be with Duryodhana." You can see how small-minded Duryodhana was and how magnanimous Yudhishthira was. Yudhishthira was a great man. Yudhishthira was more keen that the path of Dharma should be followed rather than his personal conveniences or his personal victory or gaining of the kingdom from the battle. That was less important for Yudhishthira Maharaj, and that is why Yudhishthira is so highly glorified and he was

so dear to all the great personalities like Bhishma, Drona, etc., and even Lord Krishna himself. Actually, if we want to know the truth about Yudhishthira Maharaj, we need to know the truth about Yudhishthira Maharaj. If we want to attain the favor of the Supreme Lord Krishna, and if we want everlasting fame, and we want that people should honor and respect one, then it is possible only if we follow the path of Dharma scrupulously. If we follow a pious life, then automatically people will respect us and the Supreme Lord will also, he will become dear to us. On the other hand, if we take, if we accept a life which is based on sin, then like Duryodhana we may enjoy temporary opulence and power and all that, but we will never be dear to anyone, not to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is something which we have to very clearly understand from the examples of Duryodhana and Yudhishthira Maharaj. We should not get swayed by instant success. We should look at what is the long-term repercussions of our actions and consequences of our actions.

**Key Quote:** "In such an event, you should do your best to demoralize Karna by uttering words which are unfavorable and which are discouraging to him."
**Summary:** Yudhishthira requests Shalya to demoralize Karna during the battle, and Shalya agrees, demonstrating Yudhishthira's strategic thinking and concern for Arjuna's safety.

That is far more important than some petty immediate gains. Now, Dvideshwara Maharaj told the King Shalya, "But there is still something that you can do for us." And King Shalya immediately became very eager and he said, "Please tell me, how can I help you in this battle? Well, if there is at all anything I can do, I am ready to do." Then Dvideshwara Maharaj told him, "See, King Shalya, you are renowned for your skills in driving chariots. There is nobody who is equal to you in driving a chariot. So, during the battle of Kurukshetra, eventually it will come to a pass that when Arjuna and Karna have to face each other in battle, you will be asked to drive the chariot. In such an event, you should do your best to demoralize Karna by uttering words which are unfavorable and which are discouraging to him. That will help Arjuna to win over Karna." Of course, Arjuna did not need this help. Arjuna was supported by Lord Krishna, but still Yudhishthira, out of great love for his younger brother, out of fear for his safety, Yudhishthira made this request. And King Shalya immediately assented and he said, "Oh, this is something which I can definitely do. I will keep this in mind and when the opportunity arises, I will definitely do my best." And having promised Yudhishthira Maharaj like this, King Shalya left and he proceeded towards Hastinapura with his army to join the bigger army, which Duryodhana had assembled.

**Summary:** Sanjaya returns to Hastinapura and conveys Yudhishthira's message of peace, urging Dhritarashtra to reject Duryodhana and return the kingdom to the Pandavas, but his advice is ignored.

Now, when Sanjaya came back to Hastinapura, it was already evening, and he directly went and met Dhritarashtra. And Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya what had transpired. Sanjaya informed Dhritarashtra that Yudhishthira Maharaj is so righteous. He is even now saying a very simple thing. He is ready to accept the kingdom back and forget all the animosity and hostility shown by Duryodhana. So, my dear King, you have always acted sinfully by supporting Duryodhana. Please, at least now, act in the right way. Reject Duryodhana. Hand over the kingdom back to the Pandavas and earn their goodwill. This is the only way we can live in peace. And then Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, "Okay, now tell me about the menace. What they have sent." And then Sanjaya told him, "I am tired now. I will go and take rest, and in the morning I will come to the assembly, and in the assembly, in front of everyone, I will share the message." Next day morning, Sanjaya came into the assembly and he spoke all those words which Yudhishthira Maharaj had spoken as well as what Krishna had spoken and what Arjuna and Bhima had also spoken. When the Kaurava house, when the Kaurava council heard all this, Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, all these people started telling Dhritarashtra that, "You see, now the only way is that you hand over the kingdom to the Pandavas and the Pandavas, along with all the other Kaurava brothers, let them all live peacefully together as brothers. And imagine, if Duryodhana and his hundred brothers and the Pandavas are together, then who can question your sovereignty? Your ruling over the world will be unquestioned. Even the Devatas will not be able to stand against you in battle." So in this way, Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, all of them tried explaining to

explaining to Dhritarashtra. But Dhritarashtra could also see that he was a reasonable person. He could understand what they were saying. But ultimately Dhritarashtra was bound by Duryodhana. When he looked at Duryodhana and when Dhritarashtra spoke to Duryodhana and he said, "My dear son, we should take the path of peace. Let us, you please tell, we should return the kingdom to the Pandavas." Duryodhana was unwilling. Supported by Karna, Shakuni, they were all saying, "No, no, no, no, why we should give back? Forget living with the Pandavas in friendship and all that. This is all will not work. They have actually violated the agreement and this and that," and all those kind of things. So Bhishma finally said, he said, "Duryodhana, your intelligence has been stolen. You are... you listen to only three people. One is Karna, who is a charioteer and who has been cursed by even his guru. He could not even please his guru. And another is the cunning Shakuni, who is always interested in cheating. He does not follow Dharma. And the third is your small-minded brother, Dushyasana. These are the only three people you will listen to. At least listen to what we are telling you. Look at what Dronacharya is saying, Vidura is saying, I am saying, listen to your father. Why don't you follow the right path?" When Karna heard this, he got very angry. He said, "Oh, Bhishma Deva, every time, whenever you get an opportunity, you are going on blaming me. What have I done? I have stood by Duryodhana because Duryodhana is right. What wrong has he done? He is following the path of Dharma. How can you say he is not following the path of Dharma?" Like this, Duryodhana started talking. Like this, the argument went back and forth between the different personalities. Then finally, Duryodhana said that no matter what happens, I will not return the kingdom of Indraprastha to the Pandavas. I cannot live with them in friendship. We have to have a battle and we have to decide. Either they have to live or I have to live. I cannot live in peace with them. That is out of question. So like this,

**Key Quote:** "I alone am enough for the Pandavas. All five Pandavas, I will finish. Just leave them to me."
**Summary:** Karna boasts about defeating the Pandavas, leading to a heated exchange with Bhishma, who criticizes Karna's past failures and ultimately causes Karna to vow not to fight while Bhishma is on the battlefield.

Duryodhana spoke and Karna immediately supported Duryodhana. "Don't worry, Duryodhana. I am there. No, you let all the... let Bhishma, Drona and all the other Kauravas take care of other kings. I alone am enough for the Pandavas. All five Pandavas, I will finish. Just leave them to me. That's all. Don't worry. I am there with you." Bhishma looked at Karna. He said, "What are you talking? All simply boasting your talk. When the Gandharvas took away Duryodhana, what did you do? You ran away. And then, Arjuna had to come and save him. And in the kingdom of Virata, you were there, we were there, we were all there and you were also there. We all saw your prowess, how you fought with Arjuna and defeated him. Actually, what happened? You ran away from Arjuna. And after doing all these, you are not even one-sixteenth of Arjuna's power, and you are saying, you will conquer all the five Pandavas. You are simply boasting all the time. Please stop this. After all, what have you done in your life? You are not even pleased, dear Guru Parashurama. You only managed to try to cheat him and he cursed you also. Why are you simply instigating Duryodhana like this?" Now, Karna got very much riled up and he became very offended. Then he stood up and he said, "Oh, like this, Bhishma is talking like this, always he is blaming me. I cannot tolerate this. If Bhishma is there in the battle, as long as he is in the battlefield, I will not take up weapons. If the day Bhishma Dev steps out of the battle, I will come and I will show my prowess." Like that, he stood up and in a huff, he walked out of the assembly.

**Summary:** Duryodhana diplomatically calms Bhishma and Drona, while Dhritarashtra, aware of the impending doom, remains a puppet in Duryodhana's hands, unable to prevent the war.

Now, Duryodhana was scratching his head. He said, "Oh my God, I was depending on Karna to fight the battle. Now Karna is left and gone. Now, what will I do?" Then he was seeing here and there. Then he said, "Okay, okay, Bhishma Dev, please cool down, calm down. Anyway, let us plan how to deal with the situation. I do not want to give back the kingdom to the Pandavas. We have to prepare for battle, and for that, I am depending upon you. You have to protect the kingdom of Srinapura." And like this, Duryodhana very diplomatically, he calmed down Dronacharya and Bhishma Dev and all, and he also left the assembly. Now, so finally, it was very clear that Duryodhana would at no cost return the kingdom to the Pandavas, and Dhritarashtra, although he was advised repeatedly by Vidura, Dronacharya, Bhishma Dev, etc., Dhritarashtra could never go against what Duryodhana would say. He was a puppet in the hands of Duryodhana. Although Dhritarashtra knew the reality, he knew that the Pandavas were far too powerful. They were... nobody could defeat them. Karna was insignificant in front of them. Although Bhishma Dev and Dronacharya were powerful, still Arjuna had already shown in the kingdom of Virata how he was far more powerful, and he was an equal match to Bhishma Dev, an equal match to Bhishma and Dronacharya. So, Dhritarashtra knew all this and he was very much grounded to reality. He knew that if there was a battle, the only outcome would be that Duryodhana and all his sons would be killed. But what to do? He was a puppet in the hands of Duryodhana. He could not go against his wishes. So, it looked like his destiny was sealed.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Ramachandra's rule made the entire earth equal to Brahmaloka."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the qualities of Lord Ramachandra's rule, comparing it to the spiritual world (Vaikuntha) where there is no misery, and highlighting the abundance and lack of suffering during his reign.

Regarding the rule of Lord Ramachandra, the Skanda Purana states, "As long as Lord Ramachandra ruled over..." Ruled over what? "Samastam Kshiti Vandalam." Kshiti means the earth. Kshiti Vandala means the earth globe. The entire earth was ruled over by Lord Ramachandra during his time. As long as Lord Ramachandra ruled over the earth, "Samastam Kshiti Vandalam Brahmaloka Samam Chakra." Lord Ramachandra's rule made the entire earth equal to Brahmaloka. Brahmaloka here refers to the spiritual world, which is where Brahman sustains the spiritual world. So it is called Brahmaloka, which is also known as Vaikuntha. The spiritual world is called Vaikuntha, meaning it is Vigatakuntha, meaning it is the place where there is no misery at all. Hence, during the reign of Lord Ramachandra, the entire earth was ruled over by Lord Ramachandra. He was rid of all kinds of miseries; there were no natural calamities. The weather was always pleasant, with the summers and winters appearing like springtime without excessive heat or excessive cold. The earth always produced grains, fruits, and vegetables abundantly. No one ever went hungry. The pangs of old age and disease were unknown to the citizens. No son died in the presence of his father, meaning everyone lived long lives, and no one died young. Not only that, there was no death for anyone who did not want it. So these are all the descriptions of how Lord Ramachandra...

ruled over. How did this happen? How did this become possible on this earth? Because "Ramo Ramo Ramayati Sarveshram," everyone was only chanting "Ramo Ramo Rama." The whole world was inundated with the chanting of the holy name of Lord Rama, being drowned in the flood of chanting the holy name of Lord Ramachandra. Everyone was floating in the ocean of love of Godhead, and so no miseries could touch them. This is because in Vaikuntha, everyone is similarly drowned in loving chanting of the holy name of Lord Ramachandra, and so no miseries could touch them. This is because chanting and serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a similar situation emerged on the earth during the rule of Lord Ramachandra. It was exactly like the spiritual world; the entire earth became as good as Vaikuntha, being filled with the reverberation of the holy name of Lord Ramachandra. And like this, Lord Ramachandra converted the whole earth to Vaikuntha. Lord Ramachandra ruled the earth for 13,000 years and created a Vaikuntha atmosphere on the entire earth, with every millimeter of the globe being pervaded with the chanting of the holy names of Lord Ramachandra, and the only work being done by Lord Ramachandra was the worship of Lord Ramachandra.

**Key Quote:** "The secret is not economic development it is not military or political power"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Rama Rajya with Ravana's Lanka, emphasizing that economic and military power alone cannot bring happiness and that devotion to Lord Rama is essential.

and the devotional service to Lord Ramachandra for everyone who was there at that point of time. Even now, if we want the same Rama Rajya, we can create it. What is the secret for creating Rama Rajya? The secret is not economic development; it is not military or political power. Ravana, in fact, had all these. His Lanka was called Svarna Lanka. Why? Because every house in Lanka was clad with gold. The richest of the people in the world today clad their houses with Italian marble or granite or some expensive stuff like that. But during Ravana's rule, every house was clad with actual gold. Can you imagine that? That was... we can imagine the economic powerhouse Lanka had become under Ravana. And moreover, the military power of Ravana was unrivaled in this whole universe. But despite all this economic and military and personal power, what happened? Ravana was quickly destroyed along with his life breath. Why? Because Dara means wife. Because he stole the wife of Lord Rama. Because Ravana abducted Sita Devi, his lifespan was cut short. And how was it cut short? Vispurjita Dhanusha. Simply by the twanging of the bow of Lord Rama, Ravana instantly lost his life. Lord Ramachandra did not have to take any big endeavor, simply by the twanging of his bow. So we can see from this that although Ravana had immense economic and military power, his citizens are not described to be free from anxiety and filled with bliss like the citizens of Lanka. And so, Ravana was cut short. And how was it cut short? Vispurjita Dhanusha.

Therefore, his state resulting from his death, feeling that he was being... Why did he become like this? Why did he need some power? This can be understood under the rule of Lord Rama Chandra. That means economic, scientific, medical, political, and military power are not the real cause of happiness amongst the people. Then, what can bring Ramarajya back?

**Key Quote:** "If we fill our lives and the world with chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, then the world can again experience Ramaraja, a world full of immense happiness and love of Godhead, Krishna Prema."
**Summary:** The lecture concludes by emphasizing the power of chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra to create Rama Rajya, even in Kali Yuga, leading to liberation and a life free from the problems of birth, death, disease, and old age.

The secret is... We do not control the world. All human... Uh, been constante due to Anda's devoid of all distresses, then it is inundated with "Ramo Ramo Rama Iti." If we fill our lives and the world with chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. If we fill our lives and the world with this Hare Krishna Mahamantra, then the world can again experience Ramaraja, a world full of immense happiness and love of Godhead, Krishna Prema. So the Srimad Bhagavatam says that even though Kali Yuga is filled with so many faults, so many flaws, so many problems, full of distresses, still there is one... one great, good quality, auspicious quality in Kali Yuga. What is that? "Keertanadeva Krishnasya." Simply by performing this Keertana or singing and chanting of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, what will happen? "Keertanadeva Krishnasya Muktasangaha." One will become free from all attachments in this material world and "Parambarajet," we will be able to go back to the spiritual world which is Vaikuntha, free from all distresses, free from the problems of birth, death, disease, and old age which pervades this entire material world. Nobody is free from these four problems. If we want real freedom from these four problems, then we have to take shelter of the holy name of Krishna and Rama, we have to chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra, we have to remember Lord Ramachandra's pastimes, Lord Krishna's pastimes, and then our lives can become completely blissful and the effects of birth, death, disease, and old age will become diminished in our life.

that the movement should not flounder in his absence. On April 10, 1977, Srila Prabhupada said, "Don't spoil it. We are very good, prestigious people. Don't spoil it. It's a hard day. It started with a very emotional moment. I am in humble condition, I am just comfortable, such exalted position. Don't spoil it. That is my request. Increase. That will depend on your character, behavior, position." Srila Prabhupada repeated the same request on April 22, 1977, saying, "Keep to our principle and see our GVP. It's very a lot. Then everything is gone. I am not there. Do that. That is my request. Whatever I left to you, I have taught you. Follow that. Nobody will be able to do it. No māyā will tell you. Now Kṛṣṇa is giving us, and there is no scarcity of money. To cut both, I'm sorry. Everything is there. You have got good sages all over the world. You have got, in the street you have got… Even if I die suddenly, you'll be able to manage. That I want. Manage nicely, don't go back." That was Prabhupada's concern. Again, Srila Prabhupada reiterated the same concern on 29th April 1977, where he said, "The only request is, don't spoil it."

**Summary:** Explanation of the three primary things Srila Prabhupada established: deity worship, disciplic succession, and pure books.

Srila Prabhupada wanted that whatever he had set up should continue without changes, and then the movement would flourish unhindered. Out of the many things that Srila Prabhupada set up in ISKCON, three things were primary. One was the system of deity worship. Everything that was offered to the deities, whether the arathis or the bhoga, would have to be first offered to the guru, Srila Prabhupada, and then to Nithyananda Prabhu. After that, then the arathi or the bhoga would be offered to Goranga Maha Prabhu, then it would be offered to Radharani, and finally it would get offered to Krishna. This was the system of deity worship Srila Prabhupada set up. The second thing was the disciplic conclusion, which was all the deities were offered to the guru and then there in Prabhupada's books in their pure and unadulterated form.

**Summary:** Discussion of the Diksha system, the Rtvik system, and the GBC's subsequent changes to deity worship, books, and initiations.

And the third thing, the third thing was the system of deeksha or initiations. Srila Prabhupada set up and ran the dithích system of initiations in ISKCON from 1970 to 1977, and on July 9th, 1977, Srila Prabhupada ordered the dithích system to continue even in his absence. All that was twelve years and the existence of riti groups or in口ic scoring groups and their duasas all that was first mentioned and his mothers brothers and sisters linked gifts all that was all that was reduced to satan as per tradition means he was requesting a nonpublical organization then on 3rd he went to India in 1971 under carbohydrates heComputed a memorialitta needed was that nothing be changed in ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's departure, especially these three things, dictatorship, books and initiations. However, despite Srila Prabhupada's multiple expressions of concern in 1977, that things should not be spoiled and things should continue the way he had set them up. What did the GBC do? The GBC started changing everything. They changed the system of Deity worship to offering everything to Krishna directly first, whether it was Bhoga or it was Arati. This was a complete tectonic shift in the method of Deity worship Prabhupada taught. Not only that, they changed the books and they changed the system of initiations. They changed all the rules of the GBC. They changed the rules of the GBC.

Srila Prabhupada wrote, "Don't change from this to that. That is your American disease. This is very serious that you always want to change everything." Despite Srila Prabhupada's warnings and concerns, he did not change anything. He did not change anything. He did not change anything.

primary things set up by Srila Prabhupada. As far as initiations go, on March 19, 1978, in Resolution No. 16, the GBC resolved, "The GBC will consider each year at Gaurapurnima, the appointment of new spiritual masters to be approved by a three-fourth vote. However, for 1978, no new spiritual masters shall be appointed other than the eleven selected by Srila Prabhupada." So, the GBC declared in 1978 that Srila Prabhupada appointed eleven Diksha Gurus. However, later in 1999, the GBC resolved in Resolution No. 403 that, "Unfortunately, shortly after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance, the GBC body allowed for an unauthorized zonal acharya system to evolve in ISKCON, elevating eleven exclusive successor Diksha Gurus." So, in 1999, 21 years after their resolution declaring that Srila Prabhupada selected eleven Diksha Gurus, the GBC did a old fast and accepted that it was they, not Srila Prabhupada, who would be appointed as the first Diksha Gurus. So, the GBC did a old fast and accepted that it was they, not Srila Prabhupada, who would be the first Diksha Gurus.

**Summary:** The GBC's system of regulating Diksha Gurus was invented without scriptural basis, as admitted by Satswaroop Prabhu.

follows that all other Diksha Gurus as well as the system of regulating Diksha Gurus in ISKCON by the GBC indicating no objection are all invented by the GBC. Till date, the GBC has not given any explanation for the source of their system of regulating Diksha Gurus in ISKCON. In fact, Satswaroop Prabhu, one of the original 11 Diksha Gurus from 1978, said in the year 1986, in an article which appeared in the September-October edition of Hinduism Today, in the article titled, "Murder quickens wider crisis in Krishna sect." In this article, Satswaroop Prabhu said, "If the different worship systems we instituted were accepted, then the system of regulating Diksha Gurus in ISKCON would not have been excessive. My answer is that we did not know what to do because there was no precedent scriptural rule which told us what to do." Satswaroop Prabhu openly accepted that they, the GBC, did not know what they were doing in instituting the Diksha Guru system in ISKCON in 1978. Shaila Prabhupad did not order them to institute a Diksha Guru system in ISKCON nor did he give any instructions on what to do in such a system. Nor did the GBC model their Diksha Guru system on any precedent or tradition or scripture or shastra. It appears that they did what appeared right as per their collective intelligence and discrimination. Their intelligence and discrimination decreased when the JVC was instilled into the Diksha

discrimination dictated that the Ritvik system that Srila Prabhupada ordered for implementation in ISKCON on July 9, 1977, had to be discarded after Srila Prabhupada disappeared. They did not consult Srila Prabhupada, nor did they consult Shastra, nor did they look for precedence or tradition to formulate their Deeksha Guru system, which later on underwent changes to morph into the current day no-objection Guru system. We can safely assume that they did not consult the Supersoul or Paramatma too, either in 1978 or for their current no-objection Guru system. We can also safely assume that they did not consult Shastra, nor did they look for precedence

**Summary:** The GBC does not consult the Supersoul when allowing devotees to act as Diksha Gurus, and they do not endorse them as pure devotees.

that the GBC does not consult the Supersoul or Paramatma whenever they vote for allowing a devotee to act as a Diksha Guru in ISKCON. Especially because in their resolution no. 409 of 2004, the GBC categorically resolved saying, "When the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating, it does not thereby endorse him as an Uttama Adhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. Rather, the GBC indicates that it has no objection to his initiating disciples within ISKCON." This is the GBC's resolution. Unless one is a pure devotee, one cannot talk to Krishna directly. So, as per the GBC's own resolution, they have declared that none of the devotees in ISKCON, not even the Gurus in ISKCON are pure devotees or that they have not even achieved any specific state of realization too. Hence, naturally, we must assume that they are not consulting Krishna in allowing devotees to act as Diksha Guru in ISKCON. They must be doing it on the basis of their intelligence

Listen to this carefully as Srila Prabhupada explains how he appointed temple presidents, how he appointed devotees to BBT positions, etc. "How do you choose? You are responsible for the organization." "Yes." "Are you the one who chooses, who runs each center, who is responsible in each temple?" "Yes. Our program is to open centers in every village, every town to Prabhupada and Krishnapada." "And you choose the leaders?" "Yes." "What Krishna does, he tells you, how does that work?" "No. I have been chosen by my spiritual master." "And you in turn choose others?" "Yes. That is our succession." "On what basis?" "Basis on the order of Krishna. Originally, the order is from Krishna." "How does that come?" "It comes by disciplic succession. Just like Krishna, Krishna said this knowledge to Arjuna, and Arjuna said to others, and it is open. Everyone can take it. There is no secrecy. We have to accept order. That's all."

"I missed that. I am sorry. The order is already there. It is open, open secret. There is no secrecy. Anyone can take it. All right. But in terms of specific, say, choosing specific things, specific details." "Yes. In all details. How to become Krishna Karsayas, there is all details in this book. Bhagavad Gita as it is." So he is asking what is a man's qualification to be chosen? In other words, Prabhupada will decide who should be leader if he is qualified. And there is a process for making him qualified. And there is a process for testing to see if he is qualified. So in that way, it all comes from Krishna. "You chose, for example, these fellows here to run the publishing house and be responsible for..." "Yes. Like he is in charge of publication. He is in charge of doing his research." "On what basis, sir? Can you tell me some of the things?" "Basis, just to see whether he is qualified. That's all. Just like ordinarily, when manager is appointed, by the superior authority, on the merit, on his qualification, that's all." "Okay. It's not... It's a mediated choice, or is it a direct communication from Krishna? That's my question." "No." Oh, he is asking whether we claim that God speaks to us directly. "Yes. God speaks to you when you are qualified. You cannot expect God as order supplier. Yes. When He speaks to you, you are qualified. You cannot expect God as order supplier."

I give them the understanding by which they can come to me. God is situated in everyone's… As soon as he sees that here is a qualified person, then he gives him instruction. But in the same way that Kṛṣṇa says he will provide for all your needs, you still must work to achieve whatever Kṛṣṇa is giving you. You work for Kṛṣṇa. You have to work to get your necessities. In the same way, I am curious with respect to the way Kṛṣṇa communicates with you, whether it's in a similar kind of way that gives you your necessities. In other words, when you decide that someone is to be in charge of a particular temple, does Kṛṣṇa tell you that this person should be in charge? You, by judging him, say this person is qualified." "Yes. Because a devotee always concerns Kṛṣṇa, and he gives order. So that's a more direct communication." "Yes. And he gives order. Because intelligence… Our philosophy is that intelligence comes from Kṛṣṇa. So if I have something… Your philosophy is that your daily necessities come from Kṛṣṇa." "Yes. I understand. Suppose my intelligence sees that this person is qualified, that means Kṛṣṇa has told me." "No, not necessarily. Kṛṣṇa will tell directly. A devotee always concerns Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa tells him. Two levels. Not figuratively. Practically. Does that apply then to other kinds of decisions and other kinds of activities as well?" "Everything. Everything. Because a devotee… A devotee does not do anything without concerning Kṛṣṇa."

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada always consulted Krishna directly for appointing leaders, and Krishna would give direct orders.

Now, in this exchange, Śrīla Prabhupāda, on being questioned by Mr. Kevin Lehart, about how he appointed temple presidents and devotees to BBT positions, Rāmēśvara Prabhu interpreted Śrīla Prabhupāda's answer by saying, "Suppose my intelligence sees that this person is qualified, that means Kṛṣṇa has told me." This was Rāmēśvara Prabhu's interpretation. In effect, Rāmēśvara Prabhu said that the decision was made by using one's intelligence and that meant that Kṛṣṇa had ordered it. In other words, he said that there is no direct consultation with Kṛṣṇa. But Śrīla Prabhupāda immediately corrected him saying, "No, not necessarily." He said that Kṛṣṇa will tell directly. A devotee always consults Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa tells him, do like this, not figuratively, practically. That means even to appoint temple president or any devotee to a BBT post, Śrīla Prabhupāda would always consult Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa was telling directly to Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrīla Prabhupāda would always consult Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa was telling directly to Śrīla Prabhupāda, do like this, practically, not figuratively.

**Summary:** The spiritual master's order is the order of Krishna, and Srila Prabhupada would consult Krishna directly for all appointments, including Diksha Gurus.

would appoint such a person as a temple president or to any official post in the BBT. Remember the verse Śrīla Prabhupāda so often quoted? Āchāryam mām vijāniyām nāvamanyetakarhi chit. Āchāryam mām vijāniyām nāvamanyetakarhi chit. Āchāryam mām vijāniyām nāvamanyetakarhi chit. These are Krishna's words. Whatever is said by the spiritual master is to be taken as directly the order of Krishna. No one must disrespect or disobey the spiritual master's order because the spiritual master's order is the order of Krishna. Now imagine, if even for BBT posts and temple president posts, Śrīla Prabhupāda was consulting Krishna directly and Krishna was ordering whom to appoint, then is it not all the more applicable to appointing Diksha Gurus in ISKCON, particularly for the time after Śrīla Prabhupāda's departure? Diksha Guru position is far higher than that of a temple president or even a GVC. So it is natural that if Śrīla Prabhupāda was always consulting Krishna directly for appointing a devotee to any post. Then naturally, Śrīla Prabhupāda wouldn't appoint anyone to Diksha Guru post, without consulting Krishna directly. In other words, all appointments in ISKCON came form Krishna and Śrīla Prabhupāda being the Vāyā media relayed about it.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada consulted Krishna directly about the Ritwik system, and the GBC's duty was to obey Krishna and Srila Prabhupada.

that order from Krishna. Now comes the question. If this is the case, then how do you think Srila Prabhupada appointed the Ritwiks to carry on initiations in ISKCON after his departure? How does the GBC think Srila Prabhupada sent out to all the temple presidents and the GBCs the July 9, 1977 order for implementing the Ritwiks system of initiations in ISKCON? How does the GBC think Srila Prabhupada decided on this order? Do you think Srila Prabhupada simply used this intelligence and discrimination like the GBC did in either inventing the no-objection guru system or the GBC even today is doing in selecting diksha gurus? Do you think Srila Prabhupada did not consult Krishna? In rolling out the July 9, 1977 Ritwik system of initiations order, the answer is obvious. Srila Prabhupada consulted Krishna directly about how initiations would go on in ISKCON particularly at that time when he is no longer with us and Krishna ordered. As per Krishna's order, Srila Prabhupada rolled out the July 9 order to implement Ritwik system of initiations. The duty of the GBC was to disobey Krishna and Shlala Prabhupada was minced.

**Summary:** The GBC is disobeying Srila Prabhupada and Krishna by banning the Rithvik system, which is the Dharma of every devotee and the July 9th order is Shastra.

The GBC is doing? The GBC is disobeying Srila Prabhupada, and Krishna directly. Not only is the GBC itself disobeying Srila Prabhupada, and Krishna, but the GBC is forcing all the devotees of ISKCON in Nandasilam in order to also disobey Krishnan's a visag. If so, they return to resolve Krishnan's problem. Shaila Prabhupada and Krishna in the matter of initiations in ISKCON. Because in the ISKCON law, the GBC has banned anyone from following the Rithvik system of initiations in ISKCON. This is a great offense to Shaila Prabhupada and Krishna. The July 9th, 1977 order of Shaila Prabhupada to implement the Rithvik system of initiations is the direct order of Krishna. And since Dharmamtu Sakshad Bhagavad Praneetham, whatever is ordered by Krishna becomes Dharma, it constitutes Shastra. Following the Rithvik system of initiations in ISKCON is the Dharma of every devotee in ISKCON and the July 9th Rithvik initiation system order is itself Shastra. Let us not be misled otherwise. Hare Krishna, Vishwaguru Shaila Prabhupada ki jai.

**Key Quote:** "When we are taking initiation from Srila Prabhupada, we are accepting Srila Prabhupada as our Diksha Guru, initiating spiritual master, and Prabhupada is also accepting you as his disciple."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the significance of Diksha initiation, emphasizing Srila Prabhupada's role as the Diksha Guru and referencing relevant verses from the Chaitanya Charitamrita.

So today is a very significant day in the lives of the devotees who are taking Diksha initiation. When we are taking initiation from Srila Prabhupada, we are accepting Srila Prabhupada as our Diksha Guru, initiating spiritual master, and Prabhupada is also accepting you as his disciple. It is important to understand what Diksha is, what is initiation. In the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalila, Chapter 4, Chapter 24, verse 333, purport, Srila Prabhupada says that, as far as Diksha is concerned, initiation is concerned, one must refer to the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalila, Chapter 15, verse 108. So in that purport to verse 108 of Chapter 15 of the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalila, Srila Prabhupada elaborately explains about Diksha or initiation.

**Key Quote:** "The process by which transcendental knowledge is revealed within the heart, and by the process by which sinful reactions are destroyed in one's lives, these two things constitute the process of Diksha."
**Summary:** The speaker defines Diksha based on Srila Rupa Goswami's teachings, explaining it as the process of receiving transcendental knowledge (divya jnana) and destroying sinful reactions.

Srila Prabhupada quotes Srila Rupa Goswami and he says that, divyam jnanam yathodadyat kuryat papasya sankshayam, diksheti sa chokta deshikais tatva kovidaihi. What is the definition of Diksha? The definition of Diksha, the word Diksha is taken from two words, di is taken from divya jnana, and ksha is taken from kuryat papasya sankshayam, kshaya. So divyam jnanam yathodadyat, the process by which transcendental knowledge is revealed within the heart, divyam jnanam yathodadyat. Kuryat papasya sankshayam, and by the process by which sinful reactions are destroyed in one's lives. These two things constitute the process of Diksha.

**Key Quote:** "So the process of divya jnana, of Diksha started the day when you started hearing from Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how divya jnana begins with hearing from Srila Prabhupada and progresses through chanting, reading, and gradually giving up sinful habits.

So all of you who are taking Diksha today, you have already received divya jnana in your heart to some extent. The day you came in touch with devotees and somebody gave you a book of Prabhupada and you started reading Prabhupada's books, divya jnana started revealing within your hearts, isn't it? So the process of divya jnana, of Diksha started the day when you started hearing from Srila Prabhupada. And when you started hearing from Srila Prabhupada and you decided to follow his instructions, you might have begun with chanting Hare Krishna Maha Mantra a few times, one mala, then slowly, slowly when you read, you increase your number of malas, then you come to four malas, you are still reading Prabhupada's books, so many things you are understanding. In the beginning, you may not have the understanding that Krishna is Supreme Personality of Godhead, but anyway, I am told to chant Hare Krishna, I am chanting. Some mantra, we chant like that. But as we go on reading Prabhupada's books, we understand, oh yes, Krishna is Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krishna is not like other devatas. So divya jnana has started getting revealed within the heart. And also you understand, I am not the body, I am a spirit soul, I am Atma, I am not the Deha. Divya jnana is getting revealed within the heart. And slowly what happens, you go on reading Prabhupada's books, you keep chanting, by the time you come to chant four rounds, you feel like giving up coffee and tea. And then continue reading Prabhupada's books, continue chanting, by the time you come to eight rounds, onion and garlic goes out of your life. And then slowly, slowly, you come to the stage of chanting sixteen rounds, you start wearing Kanti Mala, you start wearing Tilak, you start fasting for Ekadashi and other festival days.

**Key Quote:** "But then after reading Prabhupada's books, I realized, no, we have to fast."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about his initial experience with fasting, highlighting the challenges and the eventual determination to follow Prabhupada's instructions.

Before coming in touch with Prabhupada and Prabhupada's instructions, some of us might have been fasting, but many of us would not have fasted in our life. I, for that matter, never fasted in my life. Whole life, whenever I wanted to eat anything, I was eating. But then after reading Prabhupada's books, I realized, no, we have to fast. So, first time I fasted on Gaurapurnima day. And I didn't realize, I didn't know what is fasting. Fasting karna hai, fasting karo. By that time, it was afternoon, my stomach was growling. And by evening, I was like, you know, I am going to fall dead now. And I was working in office. Then I had to leave the office. Somehow, I drove the scooter all the way to the temple. I don't know how I drove. And then when I reached the temple, Abhishekam, all those things happened. And then finally reached the Prasadam hall, sat down with great, ah, now relief. Now I am going to eat Prasadam. Half my life is already gone by that time. And I am sitting in front of the plate, waiting when will Prasadam come and fall in the plate. Suddenly, one devotee comes and tells me, what are you sitting there for? Get up, come and serve. Another 25% of my life went out. Serve ah, what? Serve. Anyway, he is calling, I could not say no. I got up and served somehow. And then finally, he sat and had Prasadam. And I was like, oh my God. First time I was, what is this fasting? Never had, had any idea. But you see, when we, when we start following Prabhupada's instructions, we start fasting. Even though the body is demanding, body is craving, I want food, I am hungry. Body is all feeling so tired, so fatigued. No, determination has come. No, I must fast. Why? Because I am not the body. I am not given to the body's demands. So you see, Divya Jnana has started getting revealed within the heart. Meat eating goes out of the life. The coffee and tea goes out. All intoxicants go out. So, this is Kuryat Papasya Sankshayam. Papasya Sankshaya also has started happening.

**Key Quote:** "Papa or the sinful reactions in our life are of two kinds: One is the propensity to perform sinful activities which comes because of our ignorance, and second, the way the sinful reactions manifest is in the form of suffering."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the nature of sinful reactions, dividing them into the propensity to sin and the suffering they cause, further categorizing suffering into Prarabdha and Aprarabdha Karma.

So why? Because, Papa or the sinful reactions in our life are of two kinds. One is the propensity to perform sinful activities which comes by our, because of our ignorance. And because of our ignorance, that thinking that I am the body, I am not a spirit soul, we have committed so many sinful activities in our past life. So we get the propensity to perform sinful activities in our current life also, which is the result of sinful activities in our past lives. And second, the way the sinful reactions manifest is in the form of suffering. So there is suffering and when we speak of suffering on account of our accumulated sinful activities, reactions in our past lives, it again manifests in two types. One is Prarabdha Karma and another is Aprarabdha Karma. Prarabdha Karma means the results which are already manifested. This body which I have got is the result of my past activities. It is Prarabdha Karma. I have got a certain mind and intelligence that is the result of Prarabdha Karma. I might be suffering from some disease that is the result of my Prarabdha Karma. That means it is already manifest. I am already, I am already either enjoying or suffering the fruit of my past activity. The second type of sinful reaction is Aprarabdha Karma. Aprarabdha Karmam Kutam Bijam Falon Mukam. This Aprarabdha Karma is of three kinds. One is, it is in seed form. Another is sprouting. Another is the fruit which is not yet ripe. So the, when the sinful reactions in our life are accumulated like a mountain, they are all like the bija, like the seeds which you have accumulated within a jar of seeds. So when you keep the seeds in the jar, they will remain as it is.

**Key Quote:** "So when you keep the seeds in the jar, they will remain as it is. Now you take out the seed and put it into the soil, put a little water, put a little manure. What will happen? After a few days, you will see it sprouting."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of seeds, sprouting plants, and unripe fruits, the speaker explains the different stages of Aprarabdha Karma and how the spiritual master helps remove the propensity for sinful activities by guiding followers to adopt the four regulative principles.

Now you take out the seed and put it into the soil, put a little water, put a little manure. What will happen? After a few days, you will see it sprouting. So that is called Kuta. Bijam Kutam Falon Mukam. Kuta, bija is in the seed form. When the situations in your life become favorable for that seed to start sprouting, it will become like a, it will be, it will start sprouting. That sprouted plant is called Kuta. And then, the plant will grow. And after a little while, it will start giving fruits. That fruit, when it is still unripened, it is called Fala Unmukha. That means, the result is going to come. So just like suppose, I go and admit myself in engineering college. So I have just admitted myself in the college. That means in four years, the fruit of my admitting in the engineering college is going to come in the form of the degree. So, the moment I admit myself into the engineering college, my engineering degree is Fala Unmukha. It is going to come. And then finally, there is the ripened fruit, which is Prarabdha Karma. So, when we, when, so the spiritual master in your life until now, he has been giving you Divya Jnana. And he is also Kuryat Papasya Sankshayam. He is taking away the sinful reactions in your life by removing your propensities, to perform sinful activities. That is why you have started following the four regulated principles: no meat eating, no intoxication, no gambling, no illicit sex.

**Key Quote:** "So real initiation begins from the day you start hearing from the spiritual master, from Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that real initiation begins with hearing from Srila Prabhupada and making a firm determination to follow his instructions, distinguishing this from the formal Diksha ceremony.

Before you came in touch with Prabhupada's books, Prabhupada's instructions, Prabhupada's teachings, we might have been engaging in all those sinful activities. But after reading Prabhupada's books, we feel, no, I should not do that. That means the propensity was there in you, but that has been removed by Srila Prabhupada. So therefore, he has already given, put you on the, into the process of Diksha or initiation. So real initiation begins from the day you start hearing from the spiritual master, from Srila Prabhupada. And when you take the determination, when you are determined, when you read Prabhupada's books, you have to chant 16 malas, you have to follow the four regulated principles, you have to fast on Ekadashi, what happens? You start, you feel, yes, I should follow that. That determination actually constitutes Diksha or initiation. And what ceremony we are undergoing right now, where there is a fire sacrifice, you will receive a new spiritual name, you will receive beads chanted on by the Ritvik on behalf of Prabhupada, this is the formal part or the official part of Diksha. So somebody may say, then I can undergo real initiation, I will read Prabhupada's books, I will follow all his instructions, why do I have to undergo formal Diksha? Why do I need to undergo the ceremony? I will keep following whole my life. Prabhupada says that if you, as long as you are following Prabhupada's instructions and in your heart you have accepted Prabhupada as your spiritual master, as your Diksha Guru, you are as good as his disciple, but you are not yet his disciple.

**Key Quote:** "Your commitment to Srila Prabhupada goes a step higher."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of the formal Diksha ceremony, highlighting the increased commitment to Srila Prabhupada, the removal of accumulated sinful reactions, and the creation of an eternal bond.

So when you undergo Diksha, undergo the official ceremony, what happens? Your commitment to Srila Prabhupada goes a step higher. When you are sitting in the formal ceremony, what are you committing? You are committing that, I am going to accept Prabhupada as my Diksha Guru, life after life, eternally. Eternally, Prabhupada is my only sole Diksha Guru. This is the commitment you are making from your side. There is no going back from here. There is no point of no return. You cannot go back tomorrow and say that, no, I made a mistake, I want to take Diksha from someone else. No. Not in this life, not in a hundred life henceforth, not even after you go back to the spiritual world. Now from this point onwards, once you have taken formal official Diksha, even when you go to the spiritual world, there also Srila Prabhupada will be guiding you as your Diksha Guru. That is the meaning of eternally you are accepting him as your Diksha Guru. And from Prabhupada's side, he is acting as your Diksha Guru. What he does, the moment you are sitting for this formal Diksha, Prabhupada says, when you take the first initiation, Prabhupada takes away all your sinful reactions. How does Prabhupada take away all your sinful reactions? Already he has taken away all your propensity to perform sinful activities. No. Kuryat Papasanksham has already done to one extent. But all your accumulated sinful reactions in all the past lives, aprarabdha karma, sitting as Bija, Kuta, Phalamukha, where will that go? And your prarabdha karma, you have got a body and a mind and intelligence, where will that go? That also has to go, when you take formal initiation from Prabhupada, at that time, Prabhupada will take away all the prarabdha and aprarabdha karma also. Not only the propensity to perform sinful activity, Prabhupada will also take away all your accumulated sinful reactions.

**Key Quote:** "You become liable to be punished if you commit sinful activity again."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the increased responsibility that comes with formal Diksha, explaining that disciples become liable to punishment for breaking their vows and deviating from Prabhupada's instructions.

A disciple, once he has taken formal diksha from Prabhupada, once you have formally sat in the ceremony and you have taken diksha from Prabhupada, what happens? One is the eternal bond is created. Second is Prabhupada takes away all your accumulated sinful reactions. Third, what happens is, therefore, you become liable. You become liable to be punished if you commit sinful activity again. See, until you undergo formal initiation, until you undergo formal diksha from Prabhupada, suppose you followed all the four regulative principles, you were chanting sixteen malas for one year, after that, somehow, you fell down. You gave up. You started, you stopped following the four regulative principles, you stopped chanting sixteen malas. What will happen? Whatever you have done for that one year is to your eternal credit. You will get some sukruti. That's all. And loss of karma will take over. Whatever activity, punya karma, papa karma you do, go on. That much only will happen. You will get an eternal credit. You will get sukruti for whatever you have followed. But once you take formal diksha, after that, if you don't chant your rounds or you break the regulative principles, what happens? You are liable to be punished. If you don't follow, if you break, you will be punished by your diksha guru, Prabhupada and by Krishna. Until that point of time, no punishment. You are only getting sukruti. You are only getting blessing. Now blessing will be hitting also. If you disobey, if you break your vow, because in a formal ceremony what you are doing, you are sitting in front of Agni, you are sitting in front of all Vaishnavas, you are sitting in front of the Deity, and you are taking a vow that you will follow Prabhupada's instructions without fail.

### holy name, parampara, eternal bond, consciousness

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The holy name is officially getting delivered to you from the parampara. Therefore, the holy name will act more powerfully in your life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the significance of receiving beads chanted on by the Ritvik, emphasizing the delivery of the holy name from the parampara, the creation of an eternal bond with Prabhupada, and the shift in consciousness from material to spiritual.

You become liable to be punished. And Prabhupada also says, when the Rithvik has chanted on your beads, until now you are chanting, you are chanting on beads only. But what is the significance of the Rithvik chanting on the bead and that bead is being given to you? There are two significances. One is, the holy name is being delivered to you from the parampara. Until now you are chanting the holy name. Okay, no problem. The holy name was acting in your life. But now, the holy name is officially getting delivered to you from the parampara. Therefore, the holy name will act more powerfully in your life. Now, from now on when you chant Hare Krishna Mantra, that holy name will have a much more powerful effect in purifying you and taking you back to Godhead. Second thing is, that when the Rithvik has chanted on the beads and that bead is given to you, what actually it creates is, it creates an eternal bind between you and Prabhupada, as Prabhupada is your spiritual master and you as his disciple. This is the significance of the Rithvik chanting on the beads on behalf of Prabhupada and giving it to you. And as a… Now that all your prarabdha and aprarabdha karma is taken away from you, you are actually getting a new birth. You may not feel it. You may think, I am feeling the same. It is not there. It is not a matter of feeling. It is a matter of consciousness. Because you have to understand, until now, before we took initiation from Prabhupada, our consciousness was different. What was that? Sense gratification is the goal of my life. Now, when you are taking diksha from Prabhupada, what is your consciousness? Your life and substance is Prabhupada's vani, Prabhupada's instructions. Whatever Prabhupada has ordered, that is my life. And just like life cannot be separated from the body and if the life is separated from the body, then the body becomes useless. It becomes a dead body. Like that, my soul existence, I exist now only for carrying out Prabhupada's instructions because he is my diksha guru now. So my Guru Maharaj, Prabhupada's instructions are my life and soul now. For me, material sense gratification doesn't matter, material name, fame, wealth, these things are immaterial for me now. For me, what is now soul thing in my life is carrying out the instructions of my spiritual master, my Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada. So your consciousness has changed, you see. Your consciousness has gone from material consciousness to spiritual consciousness.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Now your subtle body is working spiritually. Goals have changed. Your purpose of life has changed."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that formal diksha changes the subtle body from material to spiritual, giving the initiate a brahmana body and shifting their consciousness towards spiritual goals.

How is this possible? Until and unless your subtle body is changed. Your subtle body until now was materially working. Now your subtle body is working spiritually. Goals have changed. Your purpose of life has changed. Your outlook towards life has changed. The way you perceive the material world and other people around you has changed. How this is possible? That's because your material subtle body which you have got because of your prarabdha karma is now removed and you are given a new spiritual body. You are given a brahmana body. Actually you are given a brahmana body now. So you are able to think like a brahmana because now you think in terms of shastra, right? You see, when you have a, when there is a in sanatana dharma when there is a shudra, vaishya, kshatriya they all think in terms of the body. They think in terms of sense gratification. They think in terms of fame. Shudra, simply sense gratification. Vaishya is more into hoarding money. He is interested in wealth. Kshatriya is interested in name and fame. So all revolving around the body. What does brahmana think? Brahmana's thinking, his consciousness is I have to attain moksha. I have to attain liberation. I have to know who that brahman is. So his thinking is on the spiritual platform. So now you are also thinking like that. What is your thinking? Your thinking now is my goal in life is I have to go back to Godhead. So this is how a brahmana thinks. A brahmana is not interested in sense gratification. Brahmana is not interested in doing any sinful activity. He very rigidly follows the shastra. For him, shastra is the most important. Vani of his guru is most important.

**Key Quote:** "So you were born in Kali Yuga with a Shudra body. Now Prabhupada has taken that away and given you a subtle brahmana body. So this is your second birth."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Prabhupada takes away the subtle Shudra body and gives a subtle brahmana body, signifying a second birth and the reason for receiving a new spiritual name.

So that means Prabhupada has taken away your praarabdha karma also. Praarabdha karma, Prabhupada is anyway taking away. Kootam, bijam, phalaunmukam. Prabhupada is also taking your praarabdha karma away. Because externally, the gross body that we have got, that's not the real thing. The real thing is the subtle body. How the subtle body works. So the subtle body has been your current subtle body. In Kali Yuga, everyone is born as Shudra. Even if somebody is born in a brahmana family, he is also a Shudra only. Kalau Shudra Sambhava. So you were born in Kali Yuga with a Shudra body. Now Prabhupada has taken that away and given you a subtle brahmana body. So this is your second birth. And so therefore, to signify the second birth, you are given a spiritual name. You are given a new name. You got this praarabdha karma of this body, with its subtle body, gross and subtle body, by taking birth from your mother and father. So you got a name from them. Now, Prabhupada is giving you a new birth by taking away all your past praarabdha and aprarabdha karma. And so therefore, you are getting a new spiritual name. So this is a second birth for all of you who are taking initiation. And Prabhupada says that this formal initiation ceremony is like, it is like getting, filling up the admission form when you go to school or college. So when you go to school or college, you fill in an admission form.

**Key Quote:** "Formal initiation also, it is a formality. It is like getting admitted into the college. Now, don't bunk."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of college admission, the speaker emphasizes the importance of following the spiritual master's instructions without question after formal initiation.

I also did, start bunking classes. And tell one of our friends, go and put proxy attendance. Then, although you have got admitted in the college, you really are not a student. If you are really a student, you should go and sit in the classes. You have to be attentive to the classes. You should be absorbing the lessons. You should be learning. That mood of yours, that determination of yours, I have come to the college to learn, not to bunk and go out and party with my friends. That's not my goal. I have come to the college, I have filled in the admission because I want to sit and learn something. Then you are a real student. Similarly, formal initiation also, it is a formality. It is like getting admitted into the college. Now, don't bunk. Right? Don't bunk and go and party with friends. You should follow all the rules and regulations. You should follow the instructions of the spiritual master. Order of Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada is your life and soul now. Alright? So, whatever Prabhupada has ordered, you have to follow that implicitly. No question. No question. There is no question of asking. Until now, you could have asked. Prabhupada says this. So, let me find out whether it is asked for Shastra or not. Until now, you could have asked that question. From now onwards, you cannot ask that question. Prabhupada's order, end of it. You cannot ask for Shastric evidence and all that. Where is Shastric evidence for Prabhupada's order? Where is tradition in Prabhupada's order? Now, you cannot ask that question. Prabhupada's order is your life and substance. Shastra, tradition, your understanding, not understanding, all your logic, your arguments, you want to understand how it is correct, incorrect, all that is secondary. Whether you understand or not, whether you are going to be delivered or not, are you going back to Godhead or not, all those considerations are thrown out of the window. No more consideration. Your only consideration now is, I have to follow Prabhupada's orders in my life. Period. This is the meaning of Diksha.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that true initiation requires unwavering commitment and loyalty to the Guru, which pleases the Guru and ultimately pleases Krishna, ensuring a smooth path back to Godhead.

If you are determined like this, then, you are not only formally initiated, you are also actually initiated. Otherwise, if you get, if you sit in the formal Diksha ceremony, got initiated, after initiation, if you say, Prabhupada is saying like this, but Shastra is saying something else, science is saying something else, who knows whether it is right or not, then, you are only filled in the admission form, but you are bunking the classes. So, you are not, you are not really eligible to sit in the exam to go back to Godhead. You understand? So, therefore, you have, you have to understand the significance of formal Diksha. It involves many things. It involves your commitment to Prabhupada and Prabhupada's commitment to you to take you back to Godhead, provided you fulfill all the conditions from your side. It is a two-way contract, eternally binding you to Prabhupada. So, remain determined to follow Prabhupada's warning, Prabhupada's instructions, Prabhupada's orders and that is your life and soul from this point onwards and Prabhupada is your whole, you know, is your soul Diksha Guru, life after life and you will definitely progress on the path back to Godhead. You don't have to worry about going back to Godhead, whether I will go back to Godhead or not. None of those considerations have to be there. Simply, right now, from now on, your only thinking and duty is, how to execute the orders of Srila Prabhupada. That's all. How to purify you, when to take you back to Godhead, how many lifetimes after which to take you back to Godhead, will I take three lifetimes like Jaya and Vijaya or will I take two lifetimes like Bharat Maharaj or will I go back within six months like Dhruva Maharaj, you don't have to consider all that. Your own, no matter, even if I have to take one thousand lifetimes or one million lifetimes again and again, I have to take birth within the material world, no problem. Even in every single of those million lifetimes also, I'll keep following Prabhupada's instructions, my Guru Maharaj's instructions. This should be your determination. This is the, this is what really makes you a disciple and this is what pleases Prabhupada as your Diksha Guru. This attitude of a devotee, unquestioning loyalty, this unquestioning paraabhakti towards Guru, is what pleases Guru. And if Prabhupada, your Diksha Guru, is pleased with this, yasya prasadad bhagavad prasadad, then Krishna will be pleased with you. And if Krishna is pleased with you, your going back to Godhead is not an issue at all. Comfortably, without your putting any endeavor.

**Key Quote:** "But the kind of breezes that started blowing when Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyakashipu appeared, they were Suddhusvarsha and they were Phutkaaraan Eerein."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the breeze that blew at the time of the demons' birth was unpleasant and hissing, unlike the pleasant breeze of Chennai.

So it is described here. Vavavvayu. Vayu, the air. A breeze which blows. Winds which blow. Normally in Chennai what happens, it's very humid. So when we stand outside in the tree shade, there is a breeze that blows. It feels very pleasing. It feels very nice, cooling, comforting. But the kind of breezes that started blowing when Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyakashipu appeared, they were Suddhusvarsha and they were Phutkaaraan Eerein. When the wind used to blow, when Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyakashipu were going to take birth, the breeze used to give a hissing sound. And just like you would see in if any of you before joining you have seen these horror movies, sometimes in the night they will show one window is closing, one door is closing and there is a kind of sound that comes which is very fearful. Those kind of sounds are not pleasing to the ear. And Suddhusvarsha, to the touch also, the breeze was not pleasing. So, especially when you are in Chennai, you don't have experience of breeze which is unpleasant. Isn't it?

**Key Quote:** "As soon as I got out of the car, I immediately got back inside."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal experience of arriving in Vrindavan in winter and being overwhelmed by the cold breeze.

Any time breeze blows, it's welcome. But you know, I have also been, you know, I was born and grew up in South India. So, when I went to Vrindavan, I went in 2005. So, and unfortunately I went in February. You know, January, February is the coldest season in Vrindavan. So, I had no idea how winter is in the North India. Never went out of South India. You know, Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, these were the areas which I used to roam until I joined the temple and then went to Vrindavan. So, I had no idea how winters are in the North India. Maximum winter I got exposed to was in Bangalore, you know. Maximum it would go down to 20 degrees, 22 degrees. And in Vrindavan, you know how winters are. The maximum daytime temperature at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the afternoon will be around 5 degrees or 6 degrees. That's the kind of winter. So, I had no idea. So, you know, we got into a car from the airport and drove down to Vrindavan. And our Vrindavan Chandravadey Mandir site that is there. At that time, of course, it's not like this currently. It was just plain land. There was absolutely nothing. The torus which you see now, it was still coming. So, I went and landed there. Got out of the car. As soon as I got out of the car, I immediately got back inside. There was a very cold... As it is, the temperature was cold. On top of that, a cold breeze was blowing. The moment it touched my skin, that's all. I couldn't get out of the car. I immediately jumped back inside the car. I said, I am not going to get out. Then, you know, with me other, Vyopat Prabhu and other devotees were there. They said, hey, if you don't get out, you look very bad. I see all the embassies, they are standing there. Come on, get out. So, with great difficulty, I managed to get out. So, there are breezes also which are not pleasant. So, sometimes, you know, in the extreme winter, when the breeze blows, it is not pleasing.

**Key Quote:** "And I was feeling somebody has set fire to my body."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal experience of the intense heat and unpleasant breeze during his first summer in Vrindavan.

Similarly, my first summer in Vrindavan, I still remember. Summer also, I never experienced. You know, in Bangalore, temperatures those days, maximum 28, 29. 30 was unheard of in Bangalore, those days. Nowadays, of course, it goes to 35, 36 and all that. So, when summer came, June, May, June, temperatures were sizzling, 48 degrees centigrade. I had never experienced in my life. And those days, we were not staying in the campus. We were staying outside. So, we used to come every day and go. And we used to come by bike. So, another devotee used to drive the bike. And I used to sit behind. So, in the afternoon for lunch, Prasadam, we had to go back. So, we used to stay in that Keshav Kunj, which was opposite the Krishnabal Ram temple. So, from, you can imagine, from Chattikara till there, we had to go in 48 degrees centigrade. And we were, when we were driving, the breeze was blowing. And I was feeling somebody has set fire to my body. So, at that time, breeze was not pleasing. I was thinking, when will this breeze stop? So, sometimes, breezes are not pleasing to the skin. So, it is said here, that when Hiranyaksha and, of course, in certain climates, certain weathers, the breeze may not be pleasing. But when Karthik Maas comes, when Chaitanya Maas comes, that time, the breeze is very pleasing. So, but then, when Hiranyaksha and Hiranyaka Kshapu were taking birth, the entire climate itself became so bad, that the breeze became, became distrustful, became uninviting to the touch.

**Key Quote:** "When that becomes prominent in this material world, what happens is, all the entire system around which this whole material universe is designed gets disrupted."
**Summary:** The speaker connects the unpleasant breeze and other disturbances to the increasing demoniac influence and exploitation of material nature.

And the sound that they were giving was also not pleasing to the ears. And what was happening, Vathani Ko, Vathya means, there was a, you know, these cyclones and hurricanes had become very common. So, which is what we are experiencing now. Every other day, there is a cyclone. Just recently, you know, Chennai has gone through one cyclone. Still not got over the, still the cyclone hangover is still going on. Still continuously raining. And a few years back, we had the big tsunami. And I think a couple of years back, we had a big flood also here. So, these kind of natural disturbances are actually, if you see, they are not meant to be in this world. It is not that this world is like this. No, this world is not like this. Not supposed to be like this. This world, Krishna has created in such a way, that it is supposed to be very pleasing and giving lot of peace and comfort to us. In our minds, as long as we are executing spiritual activities. The moment we go against the will of Krishna, we go against the laws of nature, we start trying to exploit material nature. Material nature as well as other living entities. When that becomes prominent in this material world, what happens is, all the entire system around which this whole material universe is designed gets disrupted. And when that gets disrupted, all these kind of natural disturbances become very prominent.

**Key Quote:** "A pure breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch, and bearing the aroma of flowers."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the omens at the time of the demons' birth with the pure and fragrant breeze that blew when Krishna appeared.

So, it is described here, When the breeze was blowing, it was very uninviting to the touch. That's how it is described when Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu were going to take birth. Because they were great demons. They were enemies of Vishnu. Now, on the other hand, in the tenth canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a description of what was the prevailing situation when Krishna was going to appear. So, the same words, Vavavvayuhu is used even when Krishna appeared. But when Krishna appeared, I'll just read that verse. When Krishna appeared, the Srimad Bhagavatam, it says, Vavavvayuhu suhasparsha. You see, when Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu came, Vavavvayuhu sudhasparsha. And when Krishna was going to appear, Vavavvayuhu suhasparsha. And then, Punyagandhavahasuchihi, Agnayastha, Dvijatina, Chandastatra samindhata. So, what it means is, I'll read the translation. A pure breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch, and bearing the aroma of flowers. Can you imagine that? It was bearing the aroma of flowers. And when the brahmanas, engaging in ritualistic ceremonies, ignited their fires, according to Vedic principles,

**Key Quote:** "The earth produces enough to satisfy the needs of a man, but not the greed of a man."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts modern cities with Vedic cities, emphasizing the importance of living in harmony with nature and avoiding greed.

the fires burned steadily. The fires were not getting extinguished. They were burning steadily despite the breeze. Why? Because the breeze was favorable. That was why it was carrying aroma of flowers. Nowadays, you go into the city, you will get nice breeze along with that, you will get nice aroma also. Of what? You will get aroma of sewage. Unfortunately, that's the way our modern cities are designed. There hardly you'll find any gardens, hardly you'll find any flowering plants. It's very difficult nowadays. But then, in the olden days, the cities were designed in such a way that every city would have beautiful parks, gardens. That used to be the center of every city. But nowadays, we have big, big concrete buildings, and very dense populations. Because of which, what happens? You have to have, you know, all the sewage gets collected, and all those kind of things start happening. So, even though big, big cities were there in the estuaries, in the Vedic times, still, the whole city would be very beautiful and very pleasing to walk around. The breeze, the plants, the fruits, the trees, everything would be very pleasing. Actually, human society is supposed to live in this manner, in harmony with material nature. And in the Vedic times, the whole civilization was, the consciousness of the civilization was how to utilize this human form of life to advance in spiritual life. So, whereas in the current day world, the whole consciousness of the civilization is how to exploit material nature and maximize my sense gratification. So, material nature, if we live according to the laws of material nature, there is ample opportunity for sense gratification, but not for unlimited, unrestricted sense enjoyment. In a limited, restricted way, in the manner it is mentioned in the Vedas, sense enjoyment is there, not that it is not there. But then, as it is said, the earth produces enough to satisfy the needs of a man, but not the greed of a man.

**Key Quote:** "Material nature also starts reacting."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that sinful activities lead to reactions from material nature, making the world an unbearable place to live.

Now, the whole civilization, human civilization has become so greedy for sense gratification that all the laws of material nature are discarded. And we try to exploit and exploit and exploit material nature because of what happens? Material nature also starts reacting. So, as Prabhupada is mentioning, the demoniac people who are accustomed to all kinds of forbidden sinful activities, they will create such a situation that the material world becomes an unbearable place to live in. So, we have to understand that we are accountable for our actions. Whatever I do, there will be some reaction involved. If the civilization is engaged in sinful activities, then material nature will give suitable reaction. We will not be able to enjoy. We will not be able to enjoy very happily. Just like if there is a criminal, and if he thinks, I will engage in all sorts of anti-social activities, and I will steal, I will rob people, and with that money, I will enjoy. It is not possible. Why? Because the police department will start running after him. And they will not allow him to live peacefully. They will go behind him until he is behind the bars. So, in a similar way, if the whole civilization is trying to go against the, orders, against the order of material nature, which has been given by Krishna or Vishnu, then what will happen? Then we will not be allowed to live peacefully. We will have to. There will be various reactions that will come. We may increase our comforts, our conveniences. We may invent many, many material, scientific inventions we may create, to give us more comforts, to give us more sense gratification. But what will happen? Material nature will make the situation worse and worse. Even though our conveniences, material conveniences increase, what will happen? Material nature will also keep increasing the pressure on us, by which we will not be able to happily enjoy those conveniences. Some pandemic will come, some cyclone will come, some flood will come, some tsunami will come. Actually, if you see, the amount of sinful activities in this material world is growing. That's how Kali Yuga is. In Kali Yuga, the sinful activities of the people keep on increasing.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the turmoil in the world and contrasts it with the steadiness present when the civilization is directed towards Krishna consciousness.

That's how you see, the whole material world, actually, this year especially, if you see, this whole world has been in total turmoil. It began with the, with the, with the pandemic. Then in the United States, there was an election. There also turmoil. And you see, in Chennai, there is cyclone, turmoil. And now, in Yelur, Andhra Pradesh, some unknown disease. Some 300 people are in the hospital. Two, three people have died. Again, turmoil. Everywhere it is, it is, you know, there is no political stability. There is no environmental stability. People's jobs, there is no stability. If you go everywhere, people are saying, tens of lakhs of people have lost their jobs due to the pandemic. So, there is no stability anywhere. Whereas, you see, how the Bhagavatam is describing, when Krishna was going to appear, even the sacrificial fire, even though breeze is blowing, was very steady. So, to that extent, steadiness is there, when the whole civilization is directed towards Krishna consciousness.

**Key Quote:** "It is incumbent upon us, to live our life, free of sinful activities."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of living a life free of sinful activities to achieve peace and align with material nature.

So, we have to understand, that, at the civilizational level, whether at the global level, or at the national level, or at the individual level, even an individual, if he engages in sinful activities, he cannot expect to remain happy with the results of those sinful actions. So, this is, actually, this is the real fact, which people become blind to, people are blind to, they are not able to appreciate, they are not able to see this. That if I commit sinful activities, they will have to suffer. And, if as a civilization, we engage in sinful activities, thinking that we will make all the arrangements for sinful activities, and we will manage the show, no. Whether at the individual level, or at the civilizational level, it is incumbent upon us, to live our life, free of sinful activities. Otherwise, we are bound to be in a situation where, we will not be peaceful. So, what we have to understand is, that, the human life, is meant to, meant for a higher purpose. And, that higher purpose, is achievable only in the human form of life. And, if we live our life, according to that goal, then, what happens is, the whole material world, the material nature, will align itself, to our activities, it will, it will, it will only, enhance our efforts, progress in that direction. It will not oppose us. When we engage in sinful activities, then material nature will oppose. It will oppose very vehemently. Whereas, if we engage in, achieving the ultimate goal of life, as described in the Vedas, then what happens, material nature will become very favorable, and it will help us, to progress in that direction. It will not oppose us.

**Summary:** The speaker laments that the ultimate goal of life in the modern world is money and introduces the conversation between Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Ramananda Raya about the true goal of life.

So, what is that ultimate goal of life? Unfortunately, today, in the modern day world, people don't know, what is the ultimate goal of life. Ultimate goal of life, in today's world is, money, money, money, sweeter than honey. Unfortunately, that's our, eat, drink, and be merry. You can eat and drink, but you cannot be merry. If you drink also, next day morning, when you get up, you will have such a headache. Where is merry? All gone. And when you are fully drunk, you don't know, what you are talking, what you are doing, nothing you will remember. Where is merry? So, you may say, eat, drink, and be merry, but actually, you cannot be merry. So, what is the ultimate goal of life? Actually, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, met Ramananda Raya, on the banks of the Godavari, so, he said, Krishna Balram, so, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu met, Ramananda Raya, on the banks of Godavari, Ramananda Raya, Ramananda Raya, was the governor, of Vidyanagara. Vidyanagara, at that time, is today's, I think, this one, Vishakaparnam. Am I right? So, there, he happened to, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, happened to meet, Ramananda Raya. So, Ramananda Raya, because he was the governor, naturally, governor will not come, you know, alone to the Godavari, people used to go to the river, to take bath, and all that. So, Ramananda Raya, came there. And, naturally, he was, being carried in a, palanquin, and there were lot of Brahmanas, and Vedic mantras, and there were all his assistants, and all those kind of people, who had come, along with him. And so, then, there, he saw Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, had also come there, and both of them, met there. And then, but then, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, did not want to discuss, too much with him, surrounding him, and he had come, in a very official manner. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, invited, invited Ramananda Raya, you come to, I am staying in one Brahmana's house, here. So, you come and meet me, in the evening. So, Ramananda Raya, in the evening, came and met Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, all alone. Just one assistant, he brought with him, and he came all alone, and met Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So, when Chaitanya, so, actually, who was this Ramananda Raya? Ramananda Raya, is, the niece, of, of Krishna. So, Lalitha and Vishakha, are the, are the, are the, after Radharani, Lalitha and Vishakha, are the next Gopis. So, Vishakha Gopi, had incarnated as, Ramananda Raya. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, asked Ramananda Raya, what is the ultimate goal, of life? It's a very important question, because, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu knows, in the earlier, Vedic civilization, everybody knew, goal of life means, we have to attain Mukti, we have to go back, to Godhead, that used to be, a common knowledge, but in Kali Yuga, nobody knows, what is the ultimate goal, of life. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu asked, Ramananda Raya, can you please tell me, what is the goal of life? It is not that, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu knows, but he wanted, an answer from, Ramananda Raya, for the benefit of, the general mass of people.

What is that, after that? Sthane Sthitah, Tanuang Nobher, Prayaso Ajitajitopya, Sitayis Trilokyam. So, Brahma Ji said, Jnane Prayasam, to engage in the process of Jnana, is, Prayasam, it is simply hard labor, there is no, result that comes out of it. No, real spiritual benefit that comes out of, undertaking the path of Jnana Yoga. Udapasi, so reject the process of Jnana Yoga. Jnane Prayasam, Udapasi, Namantayeva, so, to surrender to Krishna, by rejecting Jnana Yoga, and, Sanmukharitam, Bhavadiyava Vartam, to constantly hear your glories, submitting his prayers to Lord Krishna. So, to hear Krishna's glories, being described by devotees, that is the highest goal. And, by doing this, what happens is, Thane Sita, wherever you are situated, you may be a Brahmana, you may be a Kshatriya, you may be a Vaishya, you may be a, you may be, you may be a Sanyasi, you may be a Grihasta, you may be Brahmachari, Manaprasad, whatever you are, whichever situation you are, engage in glorifying Krishna, in the association of devotees, and by this, what happens is, Krishna is Ajitha, Ajitha Jithopiasi, Krishna is Ajitha, Ajitha means, nobody can conquer Krishna, that unconquerable Krishna, becomes Jitha, Ajitha Jithopiasi, he becomes conquered, simply by, glorifying Krishna, in the association of devotees. So, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu heard this, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, Eho Yaha, now what you are saying makes sense. Why? Because, now there is some activity, spiritual activity. What is that? To glorify Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "In Kali Yuga, the process of spiritual emancipation is, to glorify Krishna, in the association of other devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of glorifying Krishna in the association of devotees (Satamprasangat) in Kali Yuga and explains why ISKCON and other institutions are necessary.

So, what happens is, this is a very powerful process, especially in Kali Yuga. What is that? That, we engage in glorifying Krishna, Satamprasangat, in association of other devotees. Satamprasangat means, in the association of pure devotees, and in a group, as a group, we engage in glorifying Krishna. So, this process, is very, very powerful. So, that is why, the Bhagavatam, actually if you see, the Bhagavatam, is, in many, many places, you will find, from the beginning till the end, the Bhagavatam is pushing this, principle, that is, is exposing this principle, is again and again, reiterating this principle, that, in Kali Yuga, the process, the process of spiritual emancipation is, to glorify Krishna, in the association of other devotees. In the earlier ages, we could perform spiritual activities, all alone. Bharat Maharaj, he gave up his whole kingdom, and he went to the forest, and practiced Bhakti, all alone. And he reached the stage of Bhavabhakti. And later on, of course, he again took the birth of Jadabharata, and continued. He did not join, and, you know, in a group, and became a Bhakta, and started getting trained, and all that. You know, he went to the forest, and he practiced. Dhruva Maharaj, at the age of 5 years, he went to the forest, all alone, and practiced. And within 6 months, he achieved perfection. And, we all in Kali Yuga, you know, we come and join, he is gone 24, 26 years old, and 20 years will pass, but still, we will, you know, we will be in, you know, we will never, you know, what he achieved. But then, Dhruva Maharaj did it all alone. He went to Dhrotila, in Vrindavan, and he practiced. In 6 months, he had Darshan of Vishnu. You take the case of Narada Muni, Narada Muni also, for a few months, during Chaturma, for 4 months, he served all the pure devotees. After that, he went to the forest, and practiced on his own, all alone. Whereas, in Kali Yuga, if you try to do that, all these great personalities, they went to the forest, executed Bhakti, and overcame Maya. If in Kali Yuga, we try to do, first of all, you will not find a forest. Even if you find a forest, you go there, he will not overcome Maya, Maya will overcome us. So, it is not possible in Kali Yuga, to practice Krishna Consciousness, all alone. So, in the olden ages, it used to be possible. That's why, in the olden age, there was no ISKCON, there was no organization. It's not that, Panacharya had to create an organization, and everybody would come and practice. This is a very novel thing, which is happening only in Kali Yuga, which was started by Shri Krishna. And this is not unique only to our Sampradaya, Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya. Even Madhavacharya had an institution. Even Ramadhyacharya started an institution. Because, in Kali Yuga, you have to have an institutional place, where devotees can all come together, and jointly they can practice.

### Sadhana program, spiritual strength, Maya

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This is actually building up our spiritual strength."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Prabhupada's Sadhana program and how it builds spiritual strength to protect against Maya in Kali Yuga.

And that is how Prabhupada made a whole program, where we all get together, in the morning we get up, all of us come together in the temple hall, assemble together, and then we sing Samsara Dhaman Leda. And then what we do, we all sit in the temple hall, and together we chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. And then, together we do Guru Poja. Together we all sit and hear Bhagavatam class. When, you know, in the olden ages, where was this kind of system? Dhruva Maharaj or Bharat Maharaj, they were not sitting in the forest and, you know, gathering lot of people, and together let us, you know, have Bhagavatam class daily. No, they were not having. Okay, only the sages got together in Naimisharanya, because they were conducting a special sacrifice. So, they together all got together and they heard. Because anyway it was the beginning of Kali Yuga. So, they actually set the precedence. That in Kali Yuga, all of, all the sages got together and heard Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is there all the time. So, only in Kali Yuga, hearing Bhagavatam, process of hearing Bhagavatam is Satamprasangat. You have to do it in the association of others. Alone, we will not be able to do it. We will not be able to sustain. And that is why, Prabhupada has created a whole Sadhana program, where we all come together, and together we hear Bhagavatam, together we chant Hare Krishna Mantra, together we do Sankirtana. And this is the process for Kali Yuga, which is very, very powerful. And simply by engaging in this process, what happens is, we gain strength from each other, and we will be able to very quickly make progress in spiritual life. Otherwise, in Kali Yuga especially, it is very, very difficult to progress in spiritual life. To be able to protect ourselves from the forces of Maya is very, very tough. It is not at all easy. Maya is very powerful, and we are very weak. In the earlier ages, what used to happen, Maya used to be less powerful, and people used to be much stronger spiritually. Now the roles have reversed. So, therefore, we have to, you know, together we have to face the force of Maya. So we stay in the same ashram, we come and practice spiritual life together. So what happens is, in the temple, temple is a very protected environment, where the force of Maya is practically not there. So, this association of devotees, we have to appreciate, and we have to value that, you know, what Prabhupada has given us in the form of this institution, in this form of, in the form of the opportunity to be able to, be able to practice the principles of the Bhagavatam, in the manner it is described in the Bhagavatam. In the association, in a group, every day, day after day, we go on practicing. This is actually building up our spiritual strength. And this is what is required for Kalyuga. So, with these few words, I will stop. If there are any questions or comments,

**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about how distress can lead some people to spirituality while others become averse, explaining that it depends on whether a person is a Punyatma.

we can discuss. Yes, please. Yes. Harikrishna, Prabhupada. Harikrishna. Generally, like, when the people you peacefully, they can be able to think of spirituality. Yeah. But like, in one sense, material nature go on giving troubles. Of course in one sense, to correct the people, to divert them from this topic, them from the sense gratificator to spirituality but there is another chance also that people may go away from spirituality also so how to understand this okay so when there is distrust the people may not the people may become averse to spiritual life more and more isn't it so actually when distress comes in a person's life some people will see where distress comes they become very spiritually inclined others when they become distressed they'll become averse both kind of people you will see those who are Punya those who are Punyatmas when distress comes in their life they become spiritually inclined and those who are those who are more sinful you know activities those who have done when distress has come in their life of where is God I don't believe in God how can all these problems and come in my life that becomes their attitude so they'll become averse and this is what happens so if a person is if a person is a Punyatma naturally he will turn towards the towards spirituality just like there was some survey in the US that normally when you know and when the whole economy was going very well everything was going nicely before 2008 and all that everything was running very well the whole world economy was booming and the US especially was doing very well so in the churches if you see on Sunday Sunday is when you know Christians all go to church so Sunday mass hardly one or two people used to be there and that too the people would come will be old people so then after 2008 or something there was a big recession and Lehman Brothers collapsed and so many things happened so at that time what happened suddenly in the churches the church has started getting filled with people and all young people started coming so the fathers in the churches became very happy good economic depression has agreed so more people are starting coming to our churches so this is an actual reality this is an actual fact why because when distress is there many people who are who are pure niatmas who'd turn towards spirituality they realize that you know we are not in good shape of life they seem to.. the state, when human beings are sad and buy what they would call money at must they all Um,六, and notice we are hurt they are really psychological, and this is when it gets bad we are fortunate that they are forgiven they are como sóン� sapuí ten in schools they crossed so people asked three조 secure you know man, because what happened is that they honor me you when we are pulled over many people theybní we are not in control of this world we think we are in control and everything goes well we think yes I'm in full control just like car when you're driving you've got a you know illusory feeling that yes I'm fully in control but when accident happen accident happens then you realize it's not in my control so it's actually is not in your control so you know so that's the reality so material world it's time and again we have seen whenever there is war whenever there is economic depression all these kind of things the number of people going to temples the number of people going to churches the number of people going to mass this goes up this goes up tremendous so that shows when there is distress people do turn turn towards God okay thank you any other

**Key Quote:** "Otherwise, he'll get burnt out."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of the need for breaks and vacations in material work to illustrate the difference with spiritual activity.

Whenever somebody is engaged in some activity, that person after a little while needs a little break. Otherwise, he'll get burnt out. That's why every week when you go to office, there is a weekend. Saturday and Sunday are off. Shut off your mind from your work and relax and take out all the stress. Go out somewhere. Nowadays, people are talking that the five-day week should be reduced to a four-day or a three-day week. Every alternate day, they should have a holiday. That will increase the productivity of the people. And once in a year, some long holiday also is required. Go on vacation.

**Key Quote:** "Even 24 hours in a day is not enough. I want more time. I want to do more."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service to Krishna is never tiring because it is transcendental and provides constant satisfaction.

In the case of a devotee, what happens is, Anisham, constantly is engaged only in thinking of Krishna, speaking of Krishna, rendering service to Krishna. Nataraptaha, he never gets satiated. He feels whatever I'm doing is not enough. I want to do more. I want to do more. Even 24 hours in a day is not enough. I want more time. I want to do more. This is the characteristic of devotional service because it is not material. Anything material becomes hackneyed. You get fed up with it after a little time. But because devotional service to Krishna is completely transcendental, therefore, we never get satiated.

### fearlessness, surrender, protection

**Key Quote:** "Taking shelter of the Supreme Lord brings actual fearlessness and therefore the demigods decided to take shelter of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker reads and explains a verse and purport from Srimad Bhagavatam about taking shelter of the Supreme Lord to overcome fear.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 6, Chapter 9, entitled, The Appearance of the Demon, Prithrasura. Text No. 21 śrī-devā-ūchuhu vāivambharāgnya-kṣitayastriloka brahmādayo ye vayam udvijantaḥ harāmayasmai balimantakosau vibheti asmādharanam tato naḥ translation and purport by His Divine Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda The demigods said the three worlds are created by the five elements namely ether, air, fire, water and earth, which are controlled by various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahmā. Being very much afraid that the time factor will end our existence, we offer presentations unto time by performing our work as time dictates. The time factor himself, however, is afraid of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, let us now worship that Supreme Lord who alone can give us full protection. Purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda When one is afraid of being killed, one must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is worshipped by all the demigods, beginning from Brahmā. Although they are in charge of the various elements of the material world. The words vibheti asmād indicate that all the demons, regardless of how great and powerful, fear the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods, being afraid of death, took shelter of the Lord and offered Him these prayers. Although the time factor is fearful to everyone, fear personified is afraid of the Supreme Lord, who is therefore known as abhaya, fearless. Taking shelter of the Supreme Lord brings actual fearlessness and therefore the demigods decided to take shelter of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "How Mother Yasoda can put me down when I am hungry and I am drinking her milk?"
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the Damodara Lila, focusing on Krishna's anger at Yasoda for leaving him to tend to the boiling milk and his subsequent mischievous act of breaking the curd pot.

When Kṛṣṇa had appeared 5000 years ago, He performed many wonderful pastimes, especially during His childhood. When Kṛṣṇa was about probably around one year old, once it so happened that Yasodamāyī was sitting in her house and she was churning the curd, nice freshly formed curd. She was churning to take out the butter, so that she could feed Kṛṣṇa with it. And Kṛṣṇa at that time, He was feeling hungry. He walked up to His mother and started pulling her, pestering her, that I am hungry, I want milk. Yasodamāyī stopped her churning, took Kṛṣṇa on her lap and started feeding Him her breast milk. And while Kṛṣṇa was drinking His mother's milk, suddenly Yasodamāyī noticed on the fireplace, she had placed one pot of milk to boil. And this milk was a special milk which was meant for feeding Kṛṣṇa. And that milk started boiling and overflowing. Yasodamāyī immediately, she thought, oh, if this milk boils over and it gets burnt, then what will my Kṛṣṇa drink? So she immediately removed Kṛṣṇa from her lap, set Him down and ran to the kitchen. To remove the milk from the fireplace. And it would have taken some time, she had to remove the milk and then put off the fire and if some milk had been spilt over, clean up and all those kind of things. Some time it took and she came back. Now in the meantime, our Kṛṣṇa is not someone who is going to wait for anyone. He got very angry. How Mother Yasoda can put me down when I am hungry and I am drinking her milk? How she can put me down and go away? So Kṛṣṇa became very angry. I will show her what I am. So He looked around and what to do? He looked at the pot of curd that Mother Yasoda had been churning. He took a stone and broke that pot. And even, you know, all small children also when they get angry, they will do something naughty like that. And after they do it, then they will start thinking, now what is going to be the consequence? You know, when we grow up, we first think of the consequence and then we act. Children are not like that. They first act and then think of the consequence. So Kṛṣṇa also broke the pot. After breaking the pot, He started thinking, okay, my anger, Bhadas nikal diya. I, you know, I showed my anger, broke the pot. Now Mother Yasoda will come. What is going to happen? So better I scoot from here. Better I don't stay here. So silently, He slipped away from there. So Yasoda Mai, after cleaning up the kitchen or whatever, she came back and she saw, Krishna is not there. Okay, Krishna must have gone. He must have gone to play or something. But then she saw that the pot of curd has been broken and the curd is all spilled over. So she thought, who can do this? Nobody can come into the house and do all this. Krishna only must have done this. She deduced. After all, she is a mother. She knows her son. Who can know her son better than her? So she thought, Oh, Krishna, you are doing like this. I will teach you a lesson today. She started searching. Where is Krishna? Where is Krishna? Where is Krishna? And searching, searching, she came to the storehouse where Krishna was sitting and he was taking out the butter and he was feeding all the monkeys. So silently, Yasoda Mai walked up behind him, wanting to catch him. But suddenly, Krishna turned and saw, Oh, Yasoda Mai is coming. He left everything and started running. Yasoda Mai also started. She was also not going to give up. Today I have to teach him one lesson. Determined. And she ran after him and Krishna is also running. Yasoda Mai is running. And you know how difficult it is to catch children. Although they are so small, if they start running, so difficult it is. Like some of our temples, we will be doing ICVK. Right? In the, for small children, even in Chennai also, we have started ICVK. Some, some small kids, in that three to five year age guru, they will not sit quietly. They will keep running around and, and the teacher, to control the child, it is very difficult. So, she ran after him and Krishna is also running. Yasoda Mai is running. And you know how difficult it is to catch children. To control the child, it will, you know, she will be totally fed up. She will not be able to do it. So, children are like that. So, Krishna is running. Yasoda Mai is trying to catch, but she is not able to capture him. And, the laborious, you know, running, running, running. She was panting and she was perspiring. But she was also not giving up. Somehow, I am going to catch Krishna today. I am not going to give up. So, Krishna also saw that his mother has become tired. She is perspiring. And, she is, you know, breathing heavily. So, Krishna allowed himself to be captured by Yasoda Mai. Yasoda Mai caught him. And then, when she caught him, she saw Krishna was crying out of fear. What is mother is going to do now? I broke the pot. So, already in fear of the punishment, he had started crying.

**Key Quote:** "So, Krishna allowed himself to be captured by Yasoda Mai."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the Damodara Lila narration, describing Yasoda catching Krishna, his crying, her decision not to beat him, and his subsequent tying to the wooden mortar, leading to the liberation of Nalakuvara and Manigreeva.

Sometimes, it happens, no? We all, as children, if you remember, when we were in classroom, something we did, show your hand and took the scale. Before the teacher lifts this one itself, we will start crying. And, teacher will say, hey, what did I do? First, you show your hand. Don't cry. So, children are like that. So, Krishna also, Yasoda Mai is going to punish me today. He started crying. And, Yasoda Mai had applied nice mascara to Krishna's eyes. All that mascara is flowing down Krishna's cheeks. And, Krishna is in great fear. And, Yasoda Mai saw that Krishna is crying so badly. It's not good that he feels so afraid. My child should not be so much afraid of me. So, she saw in her hand, there was a stick. And, seeing the stick, she saw Krishna is becoming so afraid. So, she thought, okay, let me not beat him with this stick. She threw away the stick. But then, still punishment has to be there. Otherwise, Krishna will every time do something, even bigger. So, she saw there was a wooden mortar there. And, she took some rope and tied Krishna to it. So, you are being so naughty. So, I am punishing you. So, for some time, you remain there. Let us see what you do. So, she tied him to the wooden mortar. And, Krishna was hardly about a year old. So, Yasoda Mai then tied him and then went off. And then, Krishna thought, oh, Yasoda Mai has tied me. She tied me for breaking that pot of curd. Now, I will do something even bigger. Let us see what she will do. So, he thought what to do. And, he saw in the courtyard of Nanda Maharaj, there were two tall Arjuna trees, Yamala Arjuna trees. So, Krishna started crawling. Because, you know, one year old children, they will sometimes crawl. They will sometimes walk also. It is like that. So, Krishna started crawling. And, crawling, crawling, pulling the wooden mortar which got stuck between the two trees. And, what happened? The two trees fell down. And, out of that, two dazzling, effulgent personalities came out. They were, you all know who they are, right? Who are they? Nalakuvara and Manigreeva, the sons of Kubera. So, they came out and they offered their obeisances to Krishna. They offered their prayers and they got liberated. In the meantime, the Gopas Yashoda Mai, they all came running because two huge trees falling. They made a thundering sound. So, everybody came running out. What happened? What happened? And, they saw two trees have fallen down and Krishna is between them. So, they all thought, Oh, great fortune. Narayana has protected him. Otherwise, the trees could have fallen on Krishna. What would have been his state? He would have been crushed. So, Yashoda Mai also took Krishna and then she did not she did not chastise him or anything thinking, you know, like this. This is the famous Damodara Leela pastime. In a few months, we will have the Damodara month when we will sing those prayers and Damodara Ashtakam prayers remembering this pastime.

**Key Quote:** "She always knew that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to Krishna's later life and describes Kunti's prayers to Krishna before his departure to Dwaraka, emphasizing her understanding of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Several decades later, Krishna grew up. He got married to 16,000 princesses. He had sons, grandsons, great-grandsons. He had built Dwaraka, ruling over Dwaraka with all the Yadavas. And then, the Pandavas had also grown up. They were Krishna's cousin-brothers and they had they had become very close associates of Krishna. And the Pandavas went through many tribulations and finally, the battlefield, the battle of Kurukshetra was fought and the Pandavas got back the kingdom. By this time, Krishna had already crossed the 90 years. He was more than 90 years old. So you can see, he had, he had, you know, more than nine decades had passed. And after Yudhishthira Maharaj was enthroned as the emperor, Krishna stayed for a few months in Hastinapura to please Yudhishthira and then after a few months, then Krishna said, all the residents of Dwaraka will be waiting for me, so I have to go now. So the Pandavas assembled and Satyavati also came, although she was very old, she was also there, Shantanu's wife and the, you know, Draupadi came, Kunti Maharani came, all the Pandavas, they all came, Uttara also came, they started offering their prayers to Krishna. Great anxiety, now Krishna is going to go away. At that time, Kunti Maharani offered her prayers to Krishna. Although Kunti Maharani was the paternal daughter of Krishna, so she was in a superior position to Krishna. Although she was so, she always knew that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. She did not think of Krishna like a, my nephew, no, not like that. She, she always had the understanding that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So when she heard that Krishna is going to go back to Dwaraka, she came and offered her prayers to Krishna, and Krishna was departing. And those prayers of Kunti Maharani are captured in the first canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam.

### time factor, Krishna's control, impartiality

**Key Quote:** "The Time Factor is nothing but it is another aspect of yours."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Kunti's prayer, explaining Krishna's role as the Supreme Controller in the form of the Time Factor, highlighting the impartiality and all-encompassing control of time.

Beautiful prayers. One of the things that Kunti Maharani prayed to Krishna was, Manyetvam Kaalam Eeshanam Anadi Nidhanam Vibhum Samam Charantham Sarvatra Bhutanam Yan Mitak Kalihi. She said, because she is, you know, she is aware that she is the Supreme Controller in the form of the Time Factor. Kaalam Eeshanam. O Krishna, I know that you are Kaala, the Supreme Controller in the form of the Time Factor. Kaalam Eeshanam. So you control everybody in the form of the Time Factor. The Time Factor is nothing but it is another aspect of yours. Actually, the Time Factor it is all powerful. Nobody can withstand the force of time. So, Manyetvaam Kaalam Eeshanam Anadi Nidhanam. Anadi, Adi means beginning. Nidhanam means end or destruction. So, even in Hindi, we say when somebody dies, we say, Inka Nidhan Ho Gaya. Right? So that means Nidhanam means destruction or end. The word Adi, what it becomes Anadi. That means Adi means beginning. Anadi means without a beginning. Anadi Nidhanam means without a beginning or end. So, Krishna is that Supreme Time Factor which has neither beginning nor end. Samam Charantham Sarvatra and the Time Factor is very, very impartial. Time Factor will not see that this person, he is a small child, small baby. His Ayu, his life span has got over. But what to do, poor child, no, let him grow a little more. Time Factor will not see. Time, your time has gone up, your duration of life is over. You are a baby, you are old man, young man, girl, man, woman, child. Time Factor will not consider any of those things. Your Ayu is over, your life span is over. Time Factor is very impersonal. It will never consider, it will, it shows, does not show any mercy, no favour to anyone. So, so, Kunti Maharani said, Samam Charantham Sarvatra and all the living entities are under the control of the Time Factor. And when we see, say all living entities, it's not just limited to the Earth Planet. It's not limited to the birds and bees and all that. Even human beings are also under the control of the Time Factor. Human beings, the human civilization may develop. We may become very advanced. Science and technology may advance a lot. But no matter how much advancement we make, no matter how much scientific discoveries and inventions we make, still, we are always under the control of the Time Factor. Samam Charantham Sarvatra Bhoothaanam Yanyam Mithranam Samam Charantham Sarvatra Bhoothaanam Yanyam Mithra Kalihi So all the living entities, not only on this planet, even the Devatas are under the control of the Time Factor. Even Brahma is under the control of the Time Factor. Brahma also has a fixed lifespan. When the time comes for him to, when his lifespan gets over, after Dviparartha, two Pararthas, what happens? He has to give up his body, go on to the next body. So even Brahma, even all the Devatas, Agni, Vayu, Brahmins, Devatas, Demigods who control all the other living entities, even they are controlled by the Time Factor. Which is what the Devatas themselves are stating here. They are saying, Udvijan Taha We are afraid of the Time Factor because any moment the Time Factor may take control of us and we may die. So Kuntimharani is well aware of this. Now Kuntimharani did not stop there. He said, I am not going to stop when she glorified Krishna like this that you are the Time Factor. You are the Supreme Controller. The everybody all the Devatas everybody are afraid of you.

**Key Quote:** "Death personified fears you. And what are you doing? You are crying in fear of Yashodamai."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing Kunti's prayers, focusing on the inconceivable nature of Krishna, who is feared by death personified yet afraid of Yashoda Mai.

then she remembered see 90 years 90 years have passed by. After 90 years Kuntimharani is remembering that incident which happened when Krishna was one year old with Esodhamai in Vraja. Krishna was like a Chant in the Gopi Adade Gopi Adade Dhama Tavam Nyate Dasashru Kalilanjana Sambramaksham Vatram Niniya Bhaya Bhavana Asthithasyas Samami Bimohiti Bheerapiyat Bibheti She said Gopi Adade Dvai Krita Agasi Krita Agasi means The Gopi, Yashodamai, took a rope in her hand to tie you to the wooden mortar. At that time, What was your state? I remember your state. What was your state? There were a flood of tears flowing down your cheeks. And all the mascara was getting washed away. And this was your state. And you are in great fear of Yashodamai. And who are you? Fear personified. Fear personified. Who is fear personified? Death. And death is another form of Kala or time. So she is saying, The Kala, the time factor, is so fearful to all the Devatas. And you are the controller of that time factor. Even Kala, even death personified. Death personified fears you. And what are you doing? You are crying in fear of Yashodamai. Samam vimohayati. When I remember this, I am bewildered. How can this happen? How is this happening? So this, This is a completely inconceivable thing. A personality, Whom fear personified fears. Whom Kala, time factor, fears. Fearing whom death can happen. Whom Kala, time factor, fears. Whom Kala, time factor, fears. Death carries out its duties very impartially and very strictly. Why is death, why is Kala so impartial? Because Kala or death is very much afraid. If I don't do my duty properly, Krishna will punish me. So that death is afraid of Krishna. And that Krishna is afraid of a simple cowherd woman. Yashodamai. When I think of this, it's very, very bewildering. So it's inconceivable. How can such a great personality, Whom even death personified fears, Be afraid of a simple woman like Yashodamai? It's inconceivable.

**Key Quote:** "Actually, This shows, The, The, The, Multifaceted personality that Krishna is."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Sukadeva Goswami also highlights Krishna's inconceivable nature, emphasizing the contrast between Krishna being feared by death and being afraid of his devotee, Yashoda.

And this, This astonishment, And Krishna's becoming afraid, Of Yashodamai, Is not limited only to Kunti Maharani. Even Sukadeva Goswami, When he describes this, Pastime of the Damodara Leela, In the Srimad Bhagavatam, in the 10th canto, After describing this, He said, He said, Tam amanyata atmajam That Yashodamai, She thought Krishna is my son. Atmajam. But, Who is that Krishna? He is Avyaktam. He is that unmanifest Supreme Lord. Who is not visible to everybody. It's not that Krishna is an ordinary person. Anybody can see. No. He is such a great person. He is Avyaktam. Not everybody can see him. Only to whom Krishna reveals himself, They can see him. That is that personality. And, Adhokshajam. He is completely transcendental. But that Krishna, Yashodamai thought, This Krishna is my son. And thinking like this, What did she do? Gopikoolukhale, Damna babandha prakritam yatha. She, Damna with a rope, Ulukale babandha. She tied him to a wooden mortar. What is this? That Supreme Lord, Who is, Who is unmanifest, Who is not visible to everybody. Even the Devatas, If they want to see Krishna, They cannot see him. They have to go to the shore of, The Kshira Udaka, The milk ocean. And then they have to chant the Purusha Sukta prayers. And they please the Paramatma. Even then Paramatma also is not visible to them. He will only give instructions to Brahma in the heart. And they have to hear. And they have to follow. Om tad Vishnoha paramam padam, Sada pashyanti surayaha. Even the Devatas are waiting, When will we have darshan of the lotus feet of, Paramatma Vishnu. And that Vishnu is, One portion of the, Plenary portion of Krishna. So you can imagine, How much tougher it will be to see Krishna. And that Krishna, Yashodhama is thinking, That, This is my son. And prakritam yatha, As if Krishna is just another ordinary child, Like everybody else. Gopi kulukale damna babandashi, Took him and tied him to the wooden mat. What is this? This is completely unbelievable. So you see, Krishna's feature, On one hand, You have Krishna's feature, Of being, Fear personified, So much so that, Even fear personified fears him. So there is a, There is a facet of Krishna, Which is very frightening, To even death personified. Death frightens everyone. Right? Death terrorizes everyone. Anybody, When the point of death comes, They will all become completely afraid. So, That death who frightens everyone else, Including all the Devatas, demons, everybody, That death, Is afraid of Krishna. So Krishna has this facet, Of being very frightening. At the same time, Krishna, Has this feature, Of himself being afraid, Of his own devotees. Devotees are all completely surrendered to Krishna. They have taken shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna. To those people who have taken shelter of him, To whom he is giving protection, Krishna is afraid of them. So how is this? How do you understand this? Actually, This shows, The, The, The, Multifaceted personality that Krishna is.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "God is not to be appreciated just as a very person to be feared."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how the fearful aspect of God is present in many religions, but Srimad Bhagavatam reveals Krishna's multifaceted personality, going on to describe Krishna's arrival at Kamsa's wrestling match.

Actually, This facet of Krishna, Of being a very, A person whom we all have to fear, Is there in every religion. And that is why, If somebody is very religious, What do we say? He is a God-fearing person. He is afraid of God. Isn't it? That's what we say. Like the, Devatas are also stating here, Udvijantaha, We are afraid of Krishna. Especially in his, Form as Kala. So that is one facet of Krishna. And normally in all other scriptures, Religious scriptures, Only this facet of the Supreme Lord, Is shown to the people. Oh, God is very powerful. If you don't follow his rules, He will punish you. He will put you into hell. You will have to undergo so much misery. So, With great fear, Follow whatever he has told. So this fearful aspect of Krishna, Is there in every scripture. Even amongst tribal people, Aborigines, Those who are not very civilized people, Even amongst them, You can see, They will worship some lightning, Or some thunder, Or some big mountain, With great fear. So you will see, This facet of Krishna, Is there, Very commonly you will find it. But it's only in the Srimad Bhagavatam, Where Krishna is shown to have, Shown to be, A multi-faceted personality. And this fact, Sukadeva Goswami, Brings out in the tenth canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam. When Krishna, When he was about ten years and six months old, Krishna left, Vrindavan, Nandagav, And he came to Mathura, To attend that Mela, That great festival, Which had been organized by Kamsa. When Krishna came there, Kamsa had made a big plan, In the name of a Mela, He had called everybody, Invited everyone, He had called all his allies, Some friendly kings, And then he had called some yogis, Some ascetics, Some rishis, All those kind of people, And he had also invited all the, Village people, Here, Like that he sent an invitation to, Vraja also, To Nanda Maharaj, That we are organizing a big festival, All of you also come, Like that.

**Key Quote:** "Inconceivable Nature, Of Krishna, Pervades, All his, Characteristics, And attributes."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the inconceivable nature of Krishna and how it pervades all his characteristics, linking it to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's philosophy of simultaneous oneness and difference.

And, Swapitroho Shishu, Nanda, Who was sitting there, He is, Krishna's, Father, When he saw, He is my son, My dear son, And, Above all of them, In a separate stage, Well protected, By all the, Bodyguards, Who were sitting, Kamsa was sitting, Kamsa also saw, Krishna, Entering the stadium, How did, Kamsa see, Mrityur, Bhojapatir, Bhojapati, The king of the Bhojas, Which is, Kamsa, When he saw, Oh, He was perspiring, Sweating, His heart, Started thudding, My death has come, For him, He did not see, Krishna, And, Then, What happened, There were others, All the Rishis and Sages, How did they see him, Tattvamparam, Yoginam, All the Yogis saw, This is the, Supreme, Absolute truth, Who is stepping into the stadium, That is how, They saw him, And, Vrishnina, Paradevateti, Viditho, Rangamandale, So, Sagrajaha, Along with his, Elder brother, Krishna, Entered the Rangamandala, Like this, They saw Krishna, They saw, He is the best, Descendant of our dynasty, He, In our dynasty, There have been, So many great people, He is the best person, Of all, This is how, They saw him, So, You see, One Krishna, When he is entering the arena, How different people, Are seeing Krishna, Differently, Like this, Multi-faceted, Personality, So, God is not to be, Appreciated, Just as, A very, Person, To be feared, Krishna, Appears, To be a, Fearful, Personality, To those, Who are, Who do not, Know him, Intimately, Who are not, His devotees, And to those, Who are inimical, Towards him, But if you become, His devotee, Then, You become, Very, Very dear, To him, So, This is the, Inconceivable, Feature of Krishna, Krishna is smiling, And entering, The arena, The heart, Of the wrestlers, And Kamsa, You see, How this is, So, Inconceivable, Actually, This, Inconceivable, Nature, Of Krishna, Pervades, All his, Characteristics, And attributes, All features, Of Krishna, Is pervaded, By this, Inconceivableness, And that is, Why, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu, Built, The whole, Philosophy, Siddhanta, Sattva, The Veda, And Abheda, Simultaneously, We are one with, And different, From Krishna, And this is, Achintya, Inconceivable, Unless, We accept this, Inconceivable, Characteristic, Of Krishna, We cannot, Understand him, Fully, We cannot, Understand, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu's, Philosophy,

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So this demonstrates the inconceivable nature of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Ganga originating from Krishna's lotus feet to illustrate Krishna's inconceivable nature, emphasizing the importance of studying Srimad Bhagavatam and appreciating Srila Prabhupada's mercy in revealing these truths.

Actually, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu, Gave a, Very beautiful, Example, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu, Gives, Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu, Says, Ambujam, Ambuni, Jatam, Ambujam, Means, The Lotus, The Lotus, Is, Born, Within, The Water, Ambuni, Within, The Water, Jatam, The Lotus, Is, The Lotus, Is, Born, Within, The Water, The Water, Is, The Lotus, Is, Born, Within, The Water, Is, The Lotus, Is, The Lotus, Is, The Lotus, Is, Born, Within, The Water, Is, The Lotus, Is, The Lotus, Is, orbited, Move, From, The Whereabouts, Of, The, Lotus, From the lotus feet of Krishna, a great river has come out. Ganga has come out from the lotus feet of Krishna. See, from a lotus, water has come out. Not water, a big river has come out. You see how inconceivable this is. Water can never come from a lotus. Lotus always comes from water. But in the case of Krishna, it is the reverse. Water comes from his lotus feet. So this demonstrates the inconceivable nature of Krishna. So therefore, as devotees of Krishna, we can appreciate the multifaceted aspects of Krishna, his character. Not only his feature of being fear personified, being fearful to fear personified, but being... so sweet that he becomes afraid of his own devotee. So this is... when we understand this feature of Krishna, we can understand the Absolute Truth in full. That is why only by Bhakti, pure devotional service, we can understand the Supreme Absolute Truth in completeness. So the Devatas, they are also devotees, but they are Sakama Bhaktas. They are not Ananya Bhaktas. And so therefore, for them, Krishna is somebody whom we have to bow down to, whom we have to be always afraid of, whom even fear personified fears. This is how they appreciate. But when Bhagavatam reveals, that is not the only feature of Krishna. If you have to understand Krishna in fullness, you have to understand Esodhamai, and how Krishna is afraid. That Krishna whom even fear personified fears, is afraid of Esodhamai, his own devotee. So this is the full understanding. So this is the full understanding of Krishna. understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth which is revealed in the pages of the Srimad Bhagavatam and further revealed to us by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and so mercifully revealed to all of us by Srila Prabhupada without his, without Prabhupada's books, without Prabhupada's teachings, where we could have understood all these things? Why Krishna is afraid of Yashoda Mai and why all these different people are seeing Krishna differently? We would never have been able to understand all this. The inconceivable nature of Krishna, we would never have been able to grasp it and all this is possible simply because of our beloved spiritual master Srila Prabhupada's compassion. Because of his mercy, we are able to understand this and so therefore, we should study the Srimad Bhagavatam very seriously and that will give us access to the sweet feature of Krishna. Krishna, which is otherwise inaccessible to everybody. So I will stop here.

## The Supreme Position of Lord Ramachandra | Sri Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "However, Lord Ramachandra continues to rule the hearts of people even after millions of years. Why? Because he is not an ordinary man. He is God."
**Summary:** This segment establishes Lord Ramachandra's enduring glory and asserts his divine status based on Vedic declarations, specifically referencing the Srimad Bhagavatam.

Although Lord Ramachandra appeared such a long, long time ago, still his glories are spread everywhere. The activities of the greatest of the human beings, be they emperors or world conquerors or big, big philosophers, are forgotten after a few hundred years. During his time, Alexander must have been world famous, but today we know very little of him. In a few more decades, he may even be forgotten from the minds of the people. However, Lord Ramachandra continues to rule the hearts of people even after millions of years. Why? Because he is not an ordinary man. He is God. How do we claim that Lord Ramachandra is God and not an ordinary man? We do not claim that Lord Ramachandra is God and not an ordinary person? The basis for determining who is God or who is an incarnation of God and who is not, is not just on the basis of popularity. The basis are the Vedas. The Vedas must declare that this person is Bhagavan or God. In the first canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a description of the different incarnations or avatara of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One of them is mentioned as below: Naradevatvam Aapan Naha Surakarya Chikirsaya Samudra Nigraha Dini Chakrae Veeryaaniyata Param. In the 18th incarnation, this is what this verse of the Bhagavatam is saying. In the 18th incarnation, the Supreme Lord appeared as King Rama. In order to perform some pleasing work for the demigods, for the devatas, he exhibited superhuman powers by controlling the Indian Ocean and then killing the Atheist King Ravana who was on the other side of the sea. This is what the Srimad Bhagavatam says. So,

**Key Quote:** "We can see here clearly that Lord Rama is declared to be the incarnation of the supreme personality of God and unequivocally in the Srimad Bhagavatam."
**Summary:** This segment reinforces Lord Ramachandra's status as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, citing verses from the Srimad Bhagavatam, Padma Purana, and Vishnu Dharmottara.

Bhagavatam is saying Lord Ramachandra is an incarnation, avatara. Again in the 9th canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam it is mentioned, "Being prayed for by the devatas, by the demigods, the supreme personality of God and the absolute truth himself, directly appeared with his expansion, and expansions of the expansion. Their holy names were Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna. These celebrated incarnations thus appeared in four forms as the sons of Maharaj Dasaratha." This is what the Srimad Bhagavatam, the 9th canto says. We can see here clearly that Lord Rama is declared to be the incarnation of the supreme personality of God and unequivocally in the Srimad Bhagavatam. The Padma Purana declares that Lord Ramachandra is Narayana himself, while the Vishnu Dharmotara declares that Lord Ramachandra is an incarnation of Narayana. So Lord Ramachandra is not an ordinary person.

**Key Quote:** "Thus in multiple places, apart from the Ramayana, Lord Rama has been declared to be an incarnation of the supreme personality of Godhead in the Vedas. And hence we accept him as such."
**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing the widespread Vedic support for Lord Ramachandra being an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, referencing the Brahma Samhita and reiterating the acceptance of this truth based on Vedic authority.

But he is an expansion or incarnation, the avatara of the supreme personality of Godhead. In various parts, apart from the Ramayana, we can see how Lord Ramachandra is declared to be the supreme Lord himself. The Brahma Samhita also states, "I worship the supreme personality of Godhead, Govinda, Krishna, who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rama, Narasimha and many sub-incarnations as well, but who is the original personality of Godhead, known as Krishna, and who incarnates personally also." So even the Brahma Samhita also declares that Lord Ramachandra is an incarnation. Thus in multiple places, apart from the Ramayana, Lord Rama has been declared to be an incarnation of the supreme personality of Godhead in the Vedas.

**Key Quote:** "What this mantra essentially does is, to locate the space and time of the event."
**Summary:** This segment explains how the Sankalpa Mantra locates our position in the universe and in time, focusing on the concept of Samvatsaras and their cycle.

What this mantra essentially does is to locate the space and time of the event. When we say Jambudvipa, Bharatavarsha, Bharatakhanda, Merohodakshinaparshva, what is happening? It is locating our current position within the universe. And as far as time is concerned, this is how we are located. We are right now in the Shubhakrit Samvatsara. What does this mean? In Vedic astrology, the Samvatsaras are years which are calculated in terms of the time Brihaspati or Jupiter takes to traverse the 12 Rasis. This comes to about 360 days to traverse one Rasi. One cycle of Brihaspati to cover all the 12 Rasis comes to 12 Samvatsaras. One Chakra or cycle of Samvatsaras is 5 cycles or 60 Samvatsaras. Each of these 60 Samvatsaras is given a particular name. And the first Samvatsara is called Prabhava. We are currently in the 36th Samvatsara by the name Shubhakrit. Hence, in the Sankalpa Mantra, we say Prabhavadi Shashti Samvatsarana Madhe Shubhakrit Nama Samvatsare. Shashti means 60. Samvatsarana Madhe means in the middle of the 60 Samvatsaras. Prabhavadi means beginning with the Samvatsara named Prabhava. Shubhakrit Nama Samvatsare means in the Samvatsara by the name Shubhakrit. The 36th Samvatsara in the middle of the 60 Samvatsara cycle is called Shubhakrit.

That is, we are in the Prathamapada or first quarter of Kali Yuga. Which Kali Yuga? The Ashtavimshatitame Kali Yuge in the 28th Kali Yuga. The Kali Yuga is one of the four Yugas which constitute a Mahayuga. The Mahayuga is the cycle of the Satya Yuga, Dwapara Yuga, Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga. Out of that, we have right now passed a little more than 5100 years. One Mahayuga constitutes a cycle of Satya Yuga, Dwapara Yuga, Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga. After the present Kali Yuga ends, which will take about another 427000 years, once again Satya Yuga will start, and the Yugas will go on in the same cycle. So, we are now in the 28th Kali Yuga. One Mahayuga or a cycle of Satya, Dwapara, Treta and Kali Yugas lasts for 43.2 lakhs or 4.32 million years. There are 71 such Mahayugas in the lifespan of one Manu. Now we are in Vaivasvata Manvantara, we are in the Manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu. So, we are in the 28th Mahayuga or the 28th Kali Yuga out of 71 Mahayugas of Vaivasvata Manu. And Vaivasvata Manu is the 7th out of the 14 Manus in a day of Brahma. That means it is right now mid-day for Lord Brahma because we are in the 7th Manu out of 14 Manus. In one day of Brahma, there are 14 Manus or 1000 Mahayugas or 4.32 billion years. And similar is Brahma's night. So, 24 hours of Brahma's night is actually, for us, 8.64 billion years.

**Key Quote:** "And one Pararth of Brahma is 50 such years which comes to 155.5 trillion years and Brahma lives for 2 such Pararth's which comes to a total of 311 trillion years."
**Summary:** This segment continues the explanation of the Vedic time scale, discussing Pararthas and relating it to the appearance of Lord Krishna and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu within that timeline.

360 such days constitute one year of Brahma or it comes to 3.11 trillion years. And one Pararth of Brahma is 50 such years which comes to 155.5 trillion years and Brahma lives for 2 such Pararth's which comes to a total of 311 trillion years. Where are we right now on that time scale? Adya Brahmanah Dvitiya Parardhe meaning we are right now in the second Parardha of Lord Brahma and in that we are in Shwetavaraha Kalpe. We are in the Shwetavaraha Kalpa or Shwetavaraha Day of Brahma. Shwetavaraha Day is the first day of Brahma of the Parardha. That means we are in the first day of the 51st year of Brahma and so we can all say happy birthday to Lord Brahma. And in that we are at midday of Brahma. It is about noon time for Brahma now in the 7th Manu within which we are in the 28th Mahayuga of the 7th Manu which is Vaivasvata Manu. Lord Krishna appeared in this 28th Mahayuga, in the same Mahayuga where we are all currently in. Lord Krishna appears only once in a day of Lord Brahma and in the Mahayuga where Lord Krishna appears a unique thing happens. The Dwapara Yuga comes after Treta Yuga. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu also appears in the Kali Yuga in the same Mahayuga where Krishna appears in a day of Brahma.

### Appearance of Rama, Scriptural Authority, Vedic Time Scale

**Key Quote:** "We should not go by hearsay, but we should go by what the Acharyas and the Shastras, the Vedic scriptures have stated."
**Summary:** The lecture addresses misconceptions about when Lord Rama appeared and clarifies the correct time based on scriptures and the teachings of Srila Rupakaswami, concluding with the statement that Lord Rama appeared 17.28 million years ago.

That means Chaitanya Mahaprabhu also appears only once in a day of Brahma. So in this mega time scale of the Universe when does Lord Ramachandra appear? You would all have heard many things from many sources. Some people say Lord Rama appears in the 7th Mahayuga. It is not true. The Lord Ramachandra appears in the 7th Mahayuga. It is not the same. The Lord Rama appeared 6,000 years ago, or 7,000 years ago, some say 20 or 30,000 years ago, and so on. We should not go by hearsay, but we should go by what the Acharyas and the Shastras, the Vedic scriptures have stated. Srila Rupakaswami, in the Lagubhagavata Amrita, he mentions like this, Kausalyaayaam Dasarathaan, Navadurva Jaladyutihi, Tretaayaam Aavirbhavat, Chaturvimshe Chaturyuge, Bharatena Sumitraya, Nandana Abhyamcha Samyutaha. Srila Rupakaswami is actually describing the appearance of Lord Ramachandra. He says, Chaturvimshe Chaturyuge Tretaayaam, meaning in the Tretaayuga of the 24th Mahabharata, Lord Ramachandra appears as the son of Dasaratha and Kausalya, along with Bharatha and the two sons of Sumitra, who are Lakshmana and Shatrughna. In other words, Lord Ramachandra appeared four Mahayugas before our current Mahayuga, where we are all right now. That means Lord Ramachandra appeared about 172.8 lakh years, or 17.28 million years, ago.

## WAS RTVIK SYSTEM TEMPORARY? | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

### Ritvik system, July 9th directive, ISKCON law, Deeksha

**Key Quote:** "What we need to understand is that the July 9th directive of Srila Prabhupada, It's an order, not a doctrine."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the topic of the Ritvik system and the July 9th directive, contrasting it with the GBC's stance and ISKCON law, emphasizing that the directive is an order, not a doctrine.

Hare Krishna! Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki Jai! Srila Prabhupada very carefully formulated a system of initiations via Ritviks in his time to ensure that the movement and the parampara continue smoothly even after his disappearance from this world. And Srila Prabhupada did this through the July 9th, 1977 directive. This July 9th, 1977 directive is one of the most important directions for the institution of ISKCON because in Gaudiya Vaishnava Siddhanta, Deeksha is the foremost step in a devotee's spiritual life which eternally binds the devotee to his spiritual master and sets him on the path home, back home, back to Godhead. The ISKCON Mumbai Group's GBC has chosen to disobey this direct order of Srila Prabhupada in the matter of initiations or Deeksha. Not only has the GBC decided to disobey Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order, they have also decided that in ISKCON, nobody else should be allowed to follow this order of Srila Prabhupada. And so, they have formulated ISKCON law 6.4.7.2 which states the doctrine of ISKCON, doctrine that Srila Prabhupada desired to continue to act as Deeksha Guru after his departure from this world and did not desire any of his disciples to give Deeksha in succession after him is a dangerous philosophical deviation. Ritvikism directly goes against the principle of parampara itself of successive Deeksha and Sikhsha Gurus which sustains the pure teachings and practices of Krishna consciousness. This principle has been established by Krishna and is upheld by all Vaishnava Acharyas. Indeed, it is accepted by all followers of Vedic culture. Ritvikism is thus an extreme deviation. It is utterly erroneous to espouse it, deluding and misguiding to teach it and blasphemous to attribute it to Srila Prabhupada. No one who espouses, teaches, or practices Ritvikism can be a member in good standing of ISKCON. So, in this ISKCON law, according to the GBC, Ritvikism is a doctrine that Srila Prabhupada desired to continue to act as Deeksha Guru in succession after him and it is a dangerous philosophical deviation.

### Order vs. Doctrine, Chanting 16 rounds, Principle vs. Application

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "To chant 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra is not any doctrine."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of chanting 16 rounds to differentiate between an order and a doctrine, explaining that chanting a fixed number of times is a principle, while the specific number is an application determined by the Acharya.

What we need to understand is that the July 9th directive of Srila Prabhupada, it's an order, not a doctrine. To understand the difference between order and doctrine, let me give you a simple example. Suppose I ask you, how many rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra do you chant daily? You will respond that you chant 16 rounds. Now, if I ask you, why 16 rounds? Why are you chanting 16 rounds? You will answer, because Srila Prabhupada ordered all devotees in ISKCON to chant 16 rounds. That's why. Now, suppose I respond that, oh, so you espouse the doctrine of 16-roundism, which is a doctrine that Srila Prabhupada desired that every devotee in ISKCON should continue to chant 16 rounds after his departure and it is a dangerous philosophical deviation. Does it make any sense? Obviously, not. Why? Because to chant 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra is not any doctrine. You won't find any mention of such a thing in any Shastra. Nowhere in Shastra will you find it prescribed that you have to chant 16 rounds. You won't find any precedence of it in our Sampradaya or any other Sampradaya. The fact is that to chant a fixed number of times daily as per a vow is the principle. Sankhya Purvaka Nama. Nama, to chant the holy name a fixed number of times daily is the principle. Now, how many rounds to chant? That is left to the Acharya to determine

### Sankhya Purvaka Nama, Vow, Love for Krishna

**Key Quote:** "By chanting Krishna's holy name, a fixed number of times daily as a vow, one will develop love for Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the principle of chanting a fixed number of times as a vow (Sankhya Purvaka Nama) from the Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing its importance in developing love for Krishna.

based on various considerations like time, place, circumstance, etc. Hence, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur ordered to chant 64 rounds in Gaudiya Matha and Srila Prabhupada ordered to chant 16 rounds in ISKCON. Whether 64 or 16 rounds, both don't have any precedence or Shastric reference. That is because the principle only is there in the Shastra. And what is the principle? One must chant as per a vrata or vow. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 11, Chapter 2, Verse number 40, it is said, Evam vratah svapriya nama kirtiya. Evam vratah svapriya nama kirtiya. By chanting Krishna's holy name, a fixed number, a fixed number of times daily as a vow, one will develop love for Krishna. That is the principle. Now, when applying this principle, Srila Prabhupada has decided that the number of times should be 16 rounds.

### Deeksha, Spiritual Master, Bhajana Kriya, July 9th order
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/B2AxofMdAyU?t=335
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada has given the application, the application of the principle in his July 9th order."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the principle of taking Deeksha from a spiritual master and how Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order is an application of this principle, not a doctrine, and therefore the GBC is wrong to call it a doctrine.

Similarly, the principle as per Shastra is Adau Guruva Shayam. One's spiritual life begins when one takes Deeksha or initiation from the spiritual master. Adau Shraddha Tata Sadhu Sangha Tato Bhajana Kriya. This is the famous verse from the Nectar of Devotion, Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu. So, at the Bhajana Kriya stage, one decides to take formal Deeksha. In the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalira, Chapter 23, Verses 14 and 15, give this Adau Shraddha verse. And it states, Srila Prabhupada, in the synonyms, word-to-word synonyms of the Bhajana Kriya verse, he mentions the Bhajana Kriya, he has translated it as, Performance of Devotion. He is giving formal service to Krishna, surrendering to the spiritual master and being encouraged by the association of devotees, so that initiation takes place. In the translation to these verses also, Srila Prabhupada in the Chaitanya Charitamrita says, In the beginning, there must be faith. That is Adau Shraddha. Then one becomes interested in associating with pure devotees. This is Sadhu Sangha. Thereafter, one is initiated by the spiritual master and executes the regulative principles under his order. This is Sadhu Sangha. So, it is clear that the principle is that one must take Deeksha from a spiritual master to progress in devotional life to the next stage of Anarthanivritti and then further on till one reaches the stage of Krishna Prema. That is the principle. Now, how to get the formal Deeksha? That is an application of the principle that one must take Deeksha at the stage of Bhajana Kriya from a pure devotee. And Srila Prabhupada has given the application, the application of the principle in his July 9th order. So, therefore, it is not necessary that we will find either chanting 16 rounds or 64 rounds or the Rithvik system of initiations in Shastra. So, the GBC calling the Rithvik system of initiations as a doctrine is wrong, just like saying 16 roundism is a doctrine. So, like that, Rithvikism is a doctrine is also wrong. The Rithvik system of initiations is an offence. The Rithvik system of initiations is an offence. Therefore, it is an order of Srila Prabhupada as to how initiations will be conducted in ISKCON,

### Authenticity of July 9th order, Vani vs. Vapu, Srila Prabhupada's Potency

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The July 9th directive gets its authority because of Srila Prabhupada's vani, his order."
**Summary:** The speaker presents Amayatma Prabhu's argument that the July 9th order's authenticity comes from Srila Prabhupada's vani (order), not his vapu (physical presence), and therefore remains valid even after his disappearance.

particularly after his disappearance. Another flaw in this ISKCON law which is brought up by His Grace Amayatma Prabhu is worth considering. So, I will put Amayatma Prabhu's argument in my own words. As per the GBC, Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order appointing Rithviks was only temporary to be followed until Srila Prabhupada was physically present. That means that the GBC accepts that at least between July 9th, 1977, if not earlier, and till November 14th, 1977, the Rithvik system of initiations was valid and that the July 9th order was authentic and potent, at least for that period during Srila Prabhupada's physical presence. That raises the question, as to what forms the basis, what is the foundation of authenticity or what lends power to the July 9th order? Does the July 9th order get its authority or authenticity or potency from Srila Prabhupada's vapu or his vani? Is the July 9th order getting its power from Srila Prabhupada's body? You don't need to be an Einstein to get the answer right, the July 9th directive gets its authority because of Srila Prabhupada's vani, his order. It is his order. Therefore, it has authenticity and potency. Now, if the July 9th directive is getting its power and potency because of Srila Prabhupada's order, not his body, then Srila Prabhupada's physical presence or absence should not make any difference. Why? Because his body doesn't need any place and potency. Srila Prabhupada carries the same potency, authority and authenticity even after death.

### Dangerous Philosophical Deviation, Validity of July 9th order, Ritvik System

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Isn't that very law actually a dangerous philosophical deviation?"
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by arguing that the ISKCON law banning the Ritvik system is a dangerous philosophical deviation because it ties Srila Prabhupada's orders to his physical presence, and urges listeners to follow the July 9th order.

Just like, for example, the practice of chanting 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Mahamantra daily has the same potency to deliver the conditioned souls and take them back to Godhead. It has the same potency during Srila Prabhupada's physical presence and even in his absence. What I mean by this is- Srila Prabhupada told everyone to chant 16 malas. And so, this rule is temporary and is potent or valid only till the time of his physical presence. And after Prabhupada's disappearance, chanting 16 rounds is no more valid. It is a dangerous philosophical deviation. We have to ban it. And to chant 16 rounds in ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance has to be banned. Anybody chanting 16 rounds in ISKCON after Prabhupada's disappearance, cannot be allowed to be part of ISKCON. Can we say that? Obviously, to make such a statement would be insane. In the same way, since the July 9th directive is Srila Prabhupada's order, it has the same authority, authenticity and potency even today in his physical absence, as much as it had during his physical presence before November 14, 1977. So, to say that the July 9th order, instituting Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON cannot be followed after November 14, 1977, simply because of one reason that Srila Prabhupada's body is not there, he is not physically present, is that not actually the philosophical deviation? The ISKCON law which bans Ritvik system of Diksha saying that it is a dangerous philosophical deviation, isn't that very law actually a dangerous philosophical deviation? Isn't the GBC's idea to tie Srila Prabhupada's order or his vani to his physical presence by coining a new term called posthumous Ritvik initiation? Isn't that a dangerous philosophical deviation? Isn't the GBC's assertion that Srila Prabhupada's orders must be tied to his body and once he disappears, his orders are no longer valid? Isn't that a dangerous philosophical deviation? Srila Prabhupada's order is to follow his vani. So if you want to stay safe and steer away from those dangerous philosophical deviations, please follow Srila Prabhupada's July 9th 1977 order to institute the Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON with Srila Prabhupada as the sole Diksha Guru in ISKCON.

Hare Krishna, Vishwaguru, Srila Prabhupada ki jai. Srila Prabhupada started ISKCON in 1966 by formally registering it as a legal entity in New York, United States. As Srila Prabhupada expanded ISKCON over the next four years, opening 34 branches in that short span of time by the year 1970, Srila Prabhupada decided to adopt his Guru Maharaj, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj's vision of running the organization through a GBC body even after his disappearance.

**Summary:** This segment discusses Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj's instructions regarding the management of the Gaudiya Mutt and the role of the GBC.

Srila Prabhupada wrote about this in his letter to Rupanuga dated 28th of April 1974 thus, "In the latter days of my Guru Maharaj, he was very disturbed. Actually, he left this world earlier. Otherwise, he would have continued to live for more years. Still, he requested his disciples to form a strong governing body for preaching the cult of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He never recommended anyone to be the Acharya of the Gaudiya Mutt. But Sridhar Maharaj is responsible for disobeying this order of Guru Maharaj and he and two others who are already dead unnecessarily thought that there must be one Acharya. If Guru Maharaj could have seen someone who was qualified at that time to be Acharya, he would have mentioned. Because on the night before he passed away, he talked of so many things but never mentioned an Acharya. His idea was, Acharya was not to be nominated amongst the governing body. He said openly, you make a GBC and conduct the mission. So, his idea was, amongst the members of the GBC, who would come out successful, a self-effulgent Acharya would be automatically selected."

**Summary:** This segment highlights the unauthorized selection of Acharyas in Gaudiya Mutt and warns against repeating the same mistake in ISKCON.

So, Srila Prabhupada. Sridhar Maharaj and his two associate gentlemen unauthorisedly selected one Acharya and later it proved to be a failure. The result is, now everyone is claiming to be Acharya even though they may be Kanishad Adhikari with no ability to preach. In some of the camps, the Acharya is being changed three times in a year. Therefore, we may not commit the same mistake in our Iskand camp. Actually, amongst my godbrothers, no one is qualified to become Acharya. So, you see, Shailaprabhupada warned in this letter in 1974 that the same mistake in Gaudiya Mutt should not be committed in ISKCON. What is that mistake? The mistake of not managing the organization by a GBC body, but running after position of Acharya after his disappearance.

**Key Quote:** "In ISKCON, what happened? Eleven people assumed the position of Acharya."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the deviation in ISKCON with eleven people assuming the position of Acharya and the necessity of the GBC body.

And unfortunately, that same mistake was repeated. What happened? In Gaudiya Mutt, two people assumed the role of Acharya, the position of Acharya. In ISKCON, what happened? Eleven people assumed the position of Acharya. And Shailaprabhupada says that was a failure. Those two people becoming Acharya was a failure in Gaudiya Mutt. And as a result, what is happening? Today, everybody is claiming to be an Acharya. And look at ISKCON, eleven people became Acharyas. It was a failure. Today, everybody is becoming a Guru, Diksha Guru, Acharya. Therefore, we have to understand that in all probability, Shailaprabhupada, when he made this warning in 1974, he wanted to avoid ISKCON repeating the history of Gaudiya Mutt. And what is the mistake? Ambitious devotees vying to become Acharyas and Diksha Gurus after his disappearance. To avoid this, in most probability, Shailaprabhupada decided to form the GBC, even after his disappearance. Even when he was present on this planet in 1970, when the Acharya is present on the planet, what is the need for a GBC body? There is no need, because the Acharya is directly guiding the management. That is why Shailabhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur did not form the GBC during his manifest Leela.

**Summary:** This segment explains Srila Prabhupada's vision behind forming the GBC and training his disciples to manage the institution.

He instructed his disciples to form the GBC after his disappearance. But they did not do it. Hence, Shailaprabhupada probably not wanting to take the risk of losing the GBC body, GBC in his manifest presence, run it in his presence and train his disciples how to operate the GBC while he was still physically present. Otherwise, when Srila Prabhupada was present physically, there was no need for a GBC. But if the GBC was set up and trained by Srila Prabhupada personally during his time, it would naturally go on smoothly even after his disappearance. The transition of administrative power and responsibilities would be smoother. Their acceptability amongst the devotees would not be an issue because Srila Prabhupada in his presence, if he runs the GBC as the ultimate managing authority, then after his time also, devotees would have got used to it. The acceptability of the GBC would not have been an issue at all. So with this vision, probably, Srila Prabhupada formed the GBC

**Summary:** This segment discusses Srila Prabhupada's reasons for establishing the GBC, citing his age and the need for disciples to manage the institution.

on 28th of July 1970 via the direction of management or DOM in short. In the DOM, Srila Prabhupada begins by saying, "As we have increased our volume of activities, now, I think a governing body commission- hereinafter referred to as the GBC- should be established." Now comes the important part. "I am getting old, 75 years old. Therefore, at any time, I may be out of the scene. Therefore, I think it is necessary to give instruction to my disciples how they shall manage the institution." So, you see, Srila Prabhupada is saying here that he wants to instruct his disciples when necessary. So, the GBC, connect the two roupas. So, Srila Prabhupada is saying here that he wants to instruct his disciples if it is necessary I think that he wants the disciple how they should manage the institution after Prabhupada's disappearance. That's why he formed the GBC. They are already managing individual centers represented by one president, one secretary, and one treasurer. And in my opinion, they are doing nice. But we want still more improvement in the standard of temple management, propaganda for Krishna consciousness, distribution of books and literatures, opening of new centers, and educating devotees to the right standard. Therefore, I have decided to adopt the following principles and I hope my beloved disciples will kindly accept them. So, we can see what was running in Srila Prabhupada's mind in 1970. ISKCON had already grown to 34 centers. They had their temple president, secretary, etc. And in Srila Prabhupada's own words, they were doing nice. Then what was the need for a GBC?

**Key Quote:** "The GBC was meant to manage ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the purpose of the GBC to manage ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance and prevent power struggles.

The primary reason, as Srila Prabhupada said at that time was, "I am getting old, 75 years old. Therefore, at any time, I may be out of the scene. Therefore, I think it is necessary to give instruction to my disciples how they shall manage the whole institution." That means the GBC was meant to manage ISKCON after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance. By forming the GBC before his disappearance, Srila Prabhupada ensured that the authority of the GBC would be accepted by all his disciples and no one would question its authority after his disappearance. By giving managing power in the hands of the GBC in his physical presence, he preempted any ugly power struggle or dissension upon his disappearance. That would also mitigate the risk of ambitious disappearance. The GBC may have been an ideal for many disciples, artificially declaring themselves as diksha gurus and acharyas unauthorisedly after Srila Prabhupada's

disappearance, leading to the splitting of the movement like Gaudiya Mathu. But unfortunately, big gradually, one would say that after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance, despite Srila Prabhupada's explicit warning in his 1974 letter to not repeat the mistake of Gaudiya Mathu, the ambitious devotees in ISKCON did exactly that. They declared themselves as Diksha Gurus in March 1978. Maybe, probably because Shaila Prabhupada had set up the GBC and run it for 7 straight years, the authority of the GBC was ingrained in the minds of all the rank and file devotees. And so, therefore, the 11 Diksha Gurus could not dismantle the GBC. And that's why probably unlike the Gaudiamant which split into many, many factions after Shaila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's disappearance with no GBC to keep it together. Unlike that, ISKCON did not split up. Although, instead of 2 in Gaudiamant, in ISKCON, there were 11 Acharyas and still the ISKCON did not go on to split up because the GBC was there. So, you see Prabhupada's system of the GBC worked to some extent in ISKCON. But unfortunately, it did not preempt the ambitious Diksha Gurus. Devotees from declaring themselves as Diksha Gurus. And

**Summary:** This segment reveals the GBC's false claim about Srila Prabhupada selecting the 11 Diksha Gurus and emphasizes that the GBC is responsible for the deviations.

worse, what happened? They lied to all the Vaishnavas that they were appointed as Diksha Gurus by Shaila Prabhupada. In resolution number 16 of March 1978, in the GBC meetings, they said, "However, for 1978, no new spiritual masters shall be appointed other than the 11 selected by Shaila Prabhupada." So, they said the 11 were selected by Prabhupada. This they said in 1978. Later in 1999, the GBC in the resolution number 403 accepted that they had lied when they resolved in resolution 403. Unfortunately, shortly after Shaila Prabhupada's disappearance, the GBC allowed for an unauthorized zonal Acharya system to evolve in ISKCON, elevating 11 exclusive successor Diksha Gurus. So, here the GBC is saying the GBC allowed an unauthorized 11 successor Diksha Gurus to evolve into ISKCON. So, here the GBC is saying the GBC allowed an unauthorized 11 Diksha Guru to evolve, to develop, to come out. So, it was the GBC who did that, not Srila Prabhupada. No one can fault Srila Prabhupada for the GBC's deviation or the unfortunate events that unfolded after his disappearance

**Summary:** This segment discusses the GBC's deviation from the Ritvik system and other practices instituted by Srila Prabhupada and questions their governance performance.

and continue to unfold even today in ISKCON. Srila Prabhupada tried to prevent this by forming the GBC in his presence and training them up for seven years. He also instituted the Ritvik system in ISKCON from 1970 for seven years and ran it for seven years and then handed over the Ritvik system and the GBC to ISKCON. All that the GBC had to do was continue the Ritvik system as it is as Srila Prabhupada mentioned in the July 9th order. But what happened? Even after all this despite Srila Prabhupada doing all this, they still deviated on mass in 1978. Not only that, the deviations continued in the subsequent years. Not only did they change the method of Ritvik initiations implemented by Srila Prabhupada, they also changed the method of offering Aarati. They changed the method of offering Bhoga. They changed Srila Prabhupada's books. They changed the meaning of Parampara and so on. Why did this happen? And why does the GBC continue to deviate like this? Although many of the GBCs were good devotees, how could all of them collectively deviate so badly? Well, to get some idea of why this could happen, let us look at the performance of the GBC after Srila Prabhupada formed it in the year 1970. How did they perform in governing the institution between 1970 and 1977? Because that is what the GBC is supposed to do,

govern ISKCON. Let us hear from Srila Prabhupada himself about their performance in governing ISKCON between 1970 and 1977. On 14 August 1971, barely a year after Srila Prabhupada formed the GBC, this was Prabhupada's assessment of the GBC which he mentioned in this letter to Tamalkrishna. "I set up the GBC with hope that I shall get relief from administration of the mission, but on the contrary, I have become the center of receiving so many complaints. So, it is not a relief for me. Rather, it is becoming a little troublesome." So, you see, not a very flattering assessment of the GBC's performance. But then they were just one year old. So, we can forgive them for their shortcomings. Maybe with time, they could do better. But look at what happened in 1972. The next year, on 8th of April 1972, Srila Prabhupada sent this memo to all the ISKCON temple presidents. "Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you that recently, some of the governing body commission members held a meeting at New York on 25th

through 28th March 1972. And they have sent me a big, big minutes, duplicated, for my consideration and approval. But in the meantime, they have decided some appointments without consulting me. One of the items which struck me very much is as follows. Open quotes, "Atre Rishi Das was selected to be the secretary for GBC and receive all correspondence including monthly reports." Close quotes. I never appointed Atre Rishi member of the GBC and I do not know how he can be appointed secretary to GBC without my sanction. Once again, open quotes, "he was also appointed to be on the management committee with Karandhara for the purpose of supervising ISKCON business and implementing the decisions reached by the GBC." Close quotes. This has very much disturbed me. Sriman Atre Rishi Das may be very expert. But without my say, he has been given so much power and this has upset my brain. I also understand that immediate actions are going to take place even prior to my permission and that also without divulging to the devotees. I do not follow exactly what is the motive of the so-called GBC meeting. Therefore, I have sent the telegram which you will find attached herewith and I have received the replies as well. Under the circumstances, I authorise you to disregard for the time being any decision from the GBC men until my further instruction. So you see, in 1972, Srila Prabhupada had to suspend the entire GBC and instruct all the temple presidents not to take any decisions from the GBC. So this was the state of affairs of the GBC in 1972. Instead of getting better, they appeared to be getting worse. So

could they improve themselves in 1973? Well, let us hear what Srila Prabhupada said in this room conversation recorded on 3rd January 1973, just about two and a half years after the GBC was formed. Dr. Raghuram R. That means if GBC is valued as much as the GBC, they are themselves falling short. They are falling because. So, here you see, GBC's failure. These were the words of Shaila Prabhupada. That means, in 1973, two and a half years after the GBC was formed, it was still struggling. Would things improve with more time? About four years after the GBC was formed, Shaila Prabhupada wrote this letter to Hansadutta on 12th September 1974. "I made the GBC to give me relief, but if you do like this, then where is the relief? It is anxiety for me. This is the difficulty that as soon as one gets power, he becomes whimsical and spoils everything. What can I do?"

**Key Quote:** "Now has the GBC become more than Guru Maharaj?"
**Summary:** This segment reveals the GBC's awareness of their inability to govern effectively and Srila Prabhupada's concern that they were not focusing on spiritual life.

So, you see, the situation didn't seem to have improved much in 1974. Compared to what Shaila Prabhupada said in 1971. In 1971, Shaila Prabhupada said that GBC was not giving him any relief. And three years later, in 1974, Shaila Prabhupada was repeating the same thing. No relief from the GBC. A couple of months after this letter, some of the GBC members, namely Jaitirtha, Tamalkrishna, Hridayananda and Satsarupa, wrote this letter to their GBC Godbrothers on November 4, 1974. "As we know, Shaila Prabhupada has been disappointed in the ability of the GBC to effectively govern our ISKCON society." So, even the GBC was aware that they were unable to effectively govern ISKCON as late as November 1974. But did that awareness translate into improved performance? Almost a year later, Shaila Prabhupada wrote this letter to Jaitirtha, a GBC member, on 16th October 1975. "My only grievance is that I appointed GBC to give me relief from the management. But on the contrary, complaints and counter complaints are coming to me. Then how my brain can be peaceful?" So, things definitely hadn't improved from 1971 to 1975. What Shaila Prabhupada said in 1971 that the GBC was not giving him relief was the same thing Shaila Prabhupada repeated in 1974 as well as in 1975. About a month later, Shaila Prabhupada wrote this letter to Alal Nath on 10th of November 1975. "Now has the GBC become more than Guru Maharaj? As if simply GBC is meant for looking after pounds, shilling, pence. The GBC does not look after spiritual life. That's a defect. All of our students will have to become Guru, but they are not qualified. This is the difficult." Now that was a skating assessment from Shaila Prabhupada. The GBC were trying to become more than Shaila Prabhupada. All his students wanted to become Guru, but they were not qualified.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the conflicts within the GBC and Srila Prabhupada's assessment that some members were not following the regulative principles.

Those were Shaila Prabhupada's words of anguish. Sadly, things with the GBC did not improve in the next year either. Harikesha wrote this letter to Tamal Krishna on July 24, 1976 about the GBC. About Shaila Prabhupada. Then he said, he meaning Shaila Prabhupada. Then he said that if there are conflicts, they should be resolved amongst the GBC. He explained, meaning Shaila Prabhupada explained. He explained that these conflicts arise if there is not following of the regulative principles of chanting, etc. If these are not practiced, then there will be disturbances. One who does not chant properly or follow the principles should neither accept the post, remain in the post. He should resign for the basic qualification is not material but spiritual that the GBC member must be spiritually qualified and strong. So, even as late as 1976, there were conflicts within the GBC that they were unable to resolve. And in Srila Prabhupada's assessment, some of the GBCs were not even chanting properly or following the regulatory principles as per Srila Prabhupada and this is in 1976. This was just a little more than a year before Srila Prabhupada's disappearance and over six years of functioning of the GBC.

**Summary:** This segment highlights that even in 1977, Srila Prabhupada and his disciples knew that the GBC members were conditioned souls, leading to deviations in governance.

That the GBC were lacking was evident not only to Srila Prabhupada but even to the GBCs themselves as revealed by Tamal Krishnamaraj in a room conversation with Srila Prabhupada on 22nd of April 1977, which is a few months. Months before Prabhupada's disappearance. Listen to this portion of the conversation. "Well, I have studied myself and all of your disciples and it is clear fact that we are all conditioned souls. So, we cannot be good. Maybe one day it may be possible, not now." So you see, as late as 1977, April 1977, Srila Prabhupada knew that his GBCs were all conditioned souls. Yes. His disciples knew it too. So, we can see that all through its history, the GBC underperformed in its function of governance. Hence, it is not surprising that the GBC deviated en masse in 1978 by unauthorizedly appointing devotees as Diksha Gurus. And they continue to deviate in many ways in the system of Diksha, in the system of Deity worship, book changes, etc. The GBC themselves were conditioned.

**Key Quote:** "Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the GBC's poor performance, their acknowledgment of being weakened by the zonal Acharya deviation, and the need to fulfill their responsibilities by reverting to Srila Prabhupada's original systems.

You see, some of the ancestors themselves confessed about their poor performance in governing ISKCON in Resolution No. 403 of 1999, where in their apology to ISKCON they resolved. Whereas despite warnings by Pradyumna Prabhu and others, for many years the governing body commission being weakened, governing body commission being weakened, due to the zonal Acharya's deviation. You see, these are the words of the GBC themselves. 333и governing body commission being weakened due to the zonal acharya deviation failed to correct these errors to the detriment of many ISKCON members. Already the GBC was not performing up to the mark on the governance front even in 1977. Now the GBC accepts that they were further weakened by the zonal acharya deviation, Diksha Guru deviation in 1978. Although they don't acknowledge it, the poorly performing GBC continues to be weakened even today in his governance of ISKCON due to the unauthorized guru system that they persist with. There have been many well-meaning devotees in the GBC body. Many of them may have been personally very good devotees. They may not have had any ill intentions themselves. But it is a fact that because they were never a well-performing GBC as a body meant for governance, they made terrible mistakes which led to deviations in the system of initiations, book changes, deity worship, etc. We have nothing personally against the individual members of the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group. But all devotees in ISKCON need to know their history. Remember, those who forget history are condemned to repeat it. The GBC should fulfill its responsibility of properly governing ISKCON. By removing all the deviations and reverting to the systems that Srila Prabhupada instituted originally, the Rithvik system of initiations, the method of deity worship in offering everything to the Diksha Guru first, rolling back the book changes, etc. Then the GBC will be truly performing its role of governance up to the expectations of Srila Prabhupada and all the

**Summary:** This segment describes Srila Prabhupada's pivotal role in building ISKCON, emphasizing his transcendental vision and potency as the driving force behind the movement's rapid expansion.

Srila Prabhupada built up from scratch a worldwide organization in a relatively short span of 12 years, from 1965 to 1977. In fact, in 9 years, from 1968 to 1977, in Srila Prabhupada's own words. This was because from 1965 to 1968, not much progress was made in spreading ISKCON, especially with Srila Prabhupada's frail health in 1967. It was actually after 1968 that the movement really took off. In a lecture in 1971, Srila Prabhupada said, in this lecture given on 15th February 1971, "So, practically we began work from 1968. 66 I started, but in 67 I became very much sick. So, I came back to India and again I went there in 1968. Practically this propaganda work began vigorously from 1968." During this time between 1965 to 1977, Srila Prabhupada wrote books prolifically while he guided his spiritually naive young disciples in the nuances of detail of community worship, Vaishnava culture, hygiene standards, personal attire and the like. Simultaneously, Srila Prabhupada stitched together the disparate but sincere attempts of his disciples into a coherent force resoundingly heard across countries. The world sat up and took notice, not because of the genius marketing strategies, masterminded by some devotee, but by the transcendental vision and potency of the pure devotee, Srila Prabhupada.

**Summary:** This section uses the analogy of an orchestra to illustrate how Srila Prabhupada coordinated the efforts of his disciples, maintaining order and preventing deviations within the growing ISKCON organization.

Srila Prabhupada was like the lens which concentrates the divergent rays of the sun into a searing focal point. What otherwise appeared like random attempts by the devotees to spread the moment was coordinated by Srila Prabhupada into a symphony which rose elegantly in time. Srila Prabhupada was the expert conductor of this orchestra. Without Srila Prabhupada, it would have been nothing but cacophony. Everything was happening at a frenetic pace. Books were being published in an unending stream. Devotees were joining in droves, and temples were being opened in every nook and cranny of the world. The world was proving to be too small for the devotees. Unsurprisingly, although everything was expanding at a scorching pace between 1965 and 1977, nothing was haphazard or mindless. There was a method to the madness, and this was unsurprising given how Srila Prabhupada knew exactly what needed to be done, when and how in all matters. Srila Prabhupada was the sutradhara, the puppeteer, deftly coordinating the whole show into one smooth integrated growth in unison without any discord. Any slight deviations were dealt with swiftly and promptly, never allowing the organization to drift in any unwanted direction.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Srila Prabhupada gradually developed the Rittvik system of initiations, appointing representatives to initiate disciples on his behalf, leading to questions from the GBC.

While Srila Prabhupada did all this, he also gradually built up the rittvik system of initiations by appointing his representatives who would initiate new disciples on his behalf. Although, such appointments appeared to be a result of random adjustments to address practical difficulties and challenges as they arose, in reality, those circumstances were only instrumental in the implementation of an already existing, well thought out system in Srila Prabhupada's vision for initiations in the moment, which could run for eternity. Srila Prabhupada as always knew precisely what he was doing and why, being the sharp transcendental visionary that he was. But this was not obvious to all, and hence, the GBC on the 28th of May 1977 decided to ask Srila Prabhupada how initiations would be conducted in ISKCON, particularly at the time when Srila Prabhupada was no longer with us.

**Key Quote:** "He would appoint some of his disciples as officiating Acharyas."
**Summary:** This segment details Srila Prabhupada's response to the GBC's inquiry about initiations, explaining his plan to appoint officiating Acharyas and addressing common arguments against the Rittvik system.

Since Srila Prabhupada had already been, over the years, putting in a system for this very purpose, he immediately responded without the need to mull over it. He would appoint some of his disciples as officiating Acharyas. That is, the disciples who would officiate on behalf of the Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, would be appointed soon. And not very much later, this appointment did come. It came on the 9th of July 1977. While Srila Prabhupada may have thoughtfully implemented the Rithvik system for all time in ISKCON, with deliberate purpose, it did raise many questions in the minds of the naysayers. Some of the questions are listed like this: The Rithvik system is against tradition. This is one argument. Another one, no other Acharya has ever done this. The third one, the law of disciplic succession is that one who is now the disciple becomes the Guru next. The fourth point, in the Rithvik system, there is no opportunity for Srila Prabhupada to reject a disciple if he wishes to. And another argument, Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya: One must approach a spiritual master, surrender to him, ask him questions, and serve him. In the Rithvik system, there is no opportunity for the disciple to ask the spiritual master questions or to receive instructions on his service. And many more arguments like this. It appears from these questions that the Rithvik system of initiations appears to violate the principles of Diksha or initiation. In this video, we will attempt to gain an overview of what constitutes initiation in order to get a better understanding of the Rithvik system of initiations. Once we do that, most questions will naturally get resolved once we have this overview properly. First of all,

**Key Quote:** "Diksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity."
**Summary:** The speaker defines Diksha (initiation) according to Srila Jeeva Goswami, emphasizing the awakening of transcendental knowledge and the vanquishing of sinful reactions as its core essence.

how does Srila Prabhupada define Diksha or initiation? Srila Prabhupada, in his purport to verse number 331 of chapter 24 of the Madhya Leela of the Chaitanya Charitamrita, mentions, "As far as Diksha is concerned, one should consult Madhya Leela, chapter 15, verse 108." And if we go to Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhya Leela, chapter 15, verse 108 purport, there Srila Prabhupada says, "Srila Jeeva Goswami explains Diksha in his Bhakti Sandarbha, verse 283: divyam jnanam yato dadyat kuryat papasya sankshayam tasma dikshe tisa prokta desikais tattva kovidaihi. Diksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of the revealed scriptures knows this process as Diksha." So, essentially, as per the definition given by Srila Jeeva Goswami, Diksha or initiation constitutes two fundamental things: One is awakening transcendental knowledge and the second is vanquishing all sinful reactions. This is the real essence of Diksha or initiation.

**Summary:** This section lists commonly understood components of initiation, such as instructions from the guru, disciple's inquiries, service, surrender, fire yajna, new name, sanctified beads, karma destruction, transcendental knowledge, and the guru's responsibility.

Now, let us list down some of the commonly understood components of initiation or Diksha. Some of them are like this: 1. The spiritual master gives instructions to the disciple about his service. 2. The disciple inquires about his spiritual doubts from the spiritual master, from the Diksha Guru. 3. The disciple serves the spiritual master by carrying out his instructions. 4. The disciple surrenders to the Diksha Guru. 5. A fire yajna is conducted to formalize the acceptance of the spiritual master by the disciple. 6. After the yajna, a new spiritual name is given to the disciple. 7. Sanctified beads are handed over to the disciple who vows to chant the prescribed number of rounds of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra on those beads. All previous karmic reactions of the disciple are destroyed. This is point number 8. And point number 9: Transcendental knowledge is revealed in the heart of the disciple by the Diksha Guru. Number 10: The Diksha Guru takes responsibility to take the disciple back to Godhead. So, these are some of the commonly understood components of initiation or Diksha.

**Summary:** The speaker categorizes the components of Diksha into physical/personal, ceremonial, and transcendental aspects, providing a structured overview of the initiation process.

All these components of Diksha or initiation may be summarized in a table as you can see on the screen now. Under the first column of physical or personal aspects are listed the activities of Guru instructs on service of the disciple. Disciple carries out the instructions of the Diksha Guru. Diksha Guru clears the spiritual doubts and corrects the disciple's mistakes. These activities require a physically present person to instruct, to correct, to clear specific doubts, etc. Hence, we have included them under the physical or personal aspect. Now, under the second column of ceremonial aspects are listed the activities of formal surrender by the disciple to the Diksha Guru, formal acceptance by the Diksha Guru of the disciple, initiation yajna, Diksha yajna, initiation sacrifice, sanctified beads being handed over to the disciple, and new spiritual name being selected for the disciple. These are generally related to the initiation ceremony or the Diksha ceremony. Therefore, we have called this the ceremonial aspects of Diksha. Under the third column of transcendental aspects are listed the activities of disciple accepting the Diksha Guru in his heart and vice versa, the Guru accepting the disciple. Then the Guru reveals transcendental knowledge in the heart of the disciple. Then the Diksha Guru destroys previous karma of the disciple and the Diksha Guru takes the disciple back to Godhead.

**Summary:** This segment presents quotes from Srila Prabhupada regarding the responsibilities of GBC members and temple presidents in guiding devotees, ensuring adherence to spiritual practices, and maintaining the integrity of the teachings.

Now, let us go through a few quotes of Srila Prabhupada on the matter of the components listed under the physical or personal aspects column. Here is what Srila Prabhupada said on this matter on various occasions. "Similarly, the GBC member means they will see that in every temple, these books are very thoroughly being read and discussed and understood and applied in practical life. The GBC can supervise the things that are going on. The first management is that each and every member in the temple is chanting extremely long things and following the regulations. The representative of all five members must see that the members are chanting. So all GBC members must see that in every temple everyone is engaged. So the purpose of having in the society is to show the devotees how they can always be in 24 hours engaged according to your... Yes, that is helping one another. If I am deficient, by seeing your example, I shall correct myself. This is the idea. Not that a fool's paradise. All fools join together. Not like that. There should be ideal life. At least the leaders, the president, the GBC, they will show the example and they will follow." Srila Prabhupada, there is also a question of reciprocation. You have so many disciples, thousands. And one devotee was asking me yesterday, I want to please Srila Prabhupada. How does he know my progress and my service when I am so far away from him and if I don't write him? So there is a representative there, the president, the GBC. They will see. The representative may be there, but what is my personal relationship? To obey your spiritual master. Whatever he has said, you follow strictly. Follow the regulative principle, chant sixteen now. That's all. What happens when that inevitable time comes when a successor is needed? He is asking about the future. Who will guide the movement in the future? They will guide. I am training them. Will there be one spiritual leader though? I am training GBC 18 all over the world. His personal secretaries. I see. To see that the original teachings that Prabhupada has given are not in any way changed. In addition to whatever you just heard, in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Adi Leela, chapter 1, verse 35 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "A devotee must have only one initiating spiritual master, because in the scriptures, acceptance of more than one is always forbidden. There is no limit, however, to the number of instructing spiritual masters one may accept. Generally, a spiritual master who constantly instructs a disciple in spiritual science becomes his initiating spiritual master later on."

### Diksha, delegation, Srila Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada delegated the aspect of initiation or Deeksha which requires physical presence."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Srila Prabhupada delegated the physical and personal aspects of initiation to temple presidents and GBCs, who act as Siksha Gurus, while Srila Prabhupada himself delivers spiritual instructions through his books.

From this, from whatever you have heard until now, we can see clearly that Srila Prabhupada delegated the aspect of initiation or Diksha which requires physical presence. Srila Prabhupada delegated that to the temple presidents and to the GBCs. The temple presidents and the GBCs are supposed to be Siksha Gurus taking care of correcting, clearing doubts and assigning services to the devotees. Srila Prabhupada through his books delivers spiritual instructions to the disciples which we have classified as revealing transcendental knowledge within the heart under the column transcendental aspects. But if any devotee is in doubt after reading Srila Prabhupada's books, what does he do? Whom does he go to clear his doubts? Those doubts are to be cleared by the temple president and the GBC which falls under the first column which is called the physical or personal aspects. But of course, this does not limit Prabhupada. In many cases, some devotee has some doubt. He just opens some book of Prabhupada and starts reading or hears some lecture. Prabhupada can directly also clear those doubts. Thus, it is evident that Srila Prabhupada delegated the aspect of the initiation process or Diksha which requires physical or personal presence. Srila Prabhupada delegated that to the temple presidents and the GBCs or the senior devotees in the movement.

**Key Quote:** "So far as Gayathri initiations are concerned, the tape is not required."
**Summary:** This section presents letters from Srila Prabhupada authorizing senior devotees to perform ceremonial aspects of initiation, such as chanting the Gayatri Mantra and conducting fire ceremonies.

Now, let us look at the next aspect which is the ceremonial aspect. In a letter to Karandhara written on 13th of April 1971, Srila Prabhupada wrote, "So far as Gayathri initiations are concerned, the tape is not required. You have the threads chanted on by me and now I am enclosing here with copies of Gayathri Mantra, one for each of the seven disciples to be initiated. Hold a fire ceremony. Chant Gayathri Mantra to them individually, and let them hear and repeat. Then offer the threads on my behalf. The fire sacrifice should be performed as usual." Here, Srila Prabhupada authorized the temple president to chant the Gayathri Mantra into the ear of the devotee being initiated. In another letter to Nithyananda written on 29th of September 1972, Srila Prabhupada said something similar to what he wrote in his 1970 letter which we saw just now. So, in 1972 also, in this letter to Nithyananda, Srila Prabhupada said, "Now hold the ceremony as per the enclosed instructions. During the fire ceremony, you can also give the sacred thread and Gayathri Mantra to Bhudhara, which I am enclosing also here with. Teach him to chant on the finger divisions and play the copy of the tape of me reciting Gayathri Mantra into his right ear. Also, I am sending the beads for Michael Lightfoot duly chanted by me under separate post. So, you may hold the fire yajna, install DTs and give initiation to these two boys." In this letter, Srila Prabhupada said a recorded tape of his could be used for Gayathri initiation.

**Summary:** More letters from Srila Prabhupada are presented, showing the delegation of chanting on beads to senior devotees and the authorization of temple presidents to conduct fire yajnas and announce spiritual names.

In yet another letter to Bhutatma written on 5th of January 1973, Srila Prabhupada wrote, "Upon your recommendation, I am very glad to accept the six new students as my duly initiated disciples. Their letter is enclosed herewith. As for chanting on their beads, I have delegated Kirtananda Swami to chant on the new devotees beads on my behalf in your country. In Europe, Revatinandan Swami will chant on the new devotees beads on my behalf, because it is such long distance, therefore it is very expensive to send beads air mail from here. And there are so many instances of the beads being lost in that way. And I am getting now requests up to 20 or 30 each week. So, it is practically becoming impossible for me to chant the beads when I am so far distant. Therefore, the new devotees may send their beads to Kirtananda in New Vrindavan and he will chant the beads and send back to them. Is this all right? Now hold the fire Ejna and give also second initiation to Sarva Darshan, Ejnapati and Hari Vallabh. Enclosed, please find three sacred threads duly chanted by me along with three copies of Gayathri Mantra. Now hold the fire Ejna for all nine devotees and for the second initiates, teach them how to chant on the finger divisions and play for them the tape of me reciting Gayathri Mantra into their right ear." So, here we can see that Srila Prabhupada authorized senior devotees to chant on the beads and the temple president to conduct the Ejna to hand over the beads and announce the spiritual name of the devotee being initiated.

**Key Quote:** "They shall, of course, still be considered as my disciples. Not that they shall become your disciples."
**Summary:** This segment clarifies that devotees initiated through Rittviks are still disciples of Srila Prabhupada, with the Rittviks empowered to chant on the beads, establishing the bond between Srila Prabhupada and the disciple.

So, whose disciples would the devotees become? And what is the significance of chanting on the beads? In a letter to Revati Nandan written on 4th of January 1973, Srila Prabhupada explained this. "Just now I have received some more requests for giving first initiation from Dhananjaya. And now I am receiving weekly not less than 10 to 15 such requests from new students. So, it is becoming very expensive to send so many sets of beads such long distance, and it has become little bothersome for me also. So, I think now you may be appointed by me to give first initiations to new disciples by chanting on their beads on my behalf. In America, Kirtananda Swami is doing that. So, now if there are two of you, that will give me great relief. Kirtananda will chant on the beads for new devotees in America, Canada, like that. You can chant on the beads for the European continent new disciples. They shall, of course, still be considered as my disciples, not that they shall become your disciples, but you will be empowered by me to chant their beads, and that is the same effect of binding master and disciple as if I were personally chanting." So, the senior devotees who are acting as Rithwiks were empowered by Srila Prabhupada to chant on the beads, thus, binding Srila Prabhupada as the Diksha Guru or spiritual master to the disciple.

**Key Quote:** "The chanting Hare Krishna is our main business. That is real initiation."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspects of Diksha to senior devotees and emphasizes the importance of the transcendental aspects of initiation, such as chanting Hare Krishna.

Now, it is clear that Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspects of the process of Diksha or initiation, the Diksha Vidhana to the senior devotees. And on July 9th, Srila Prabhupada delegated the choosing of names also to the Rithwiks. Now, let us look at a few more quotes of Srila Prabhupada with respect to the last column, the transcendental aspects column. In a letter to Tamal Krishna written on 19th of August 1968, Srila Prabhupada wrote, "The chanting Hare Krishna is our main business. That is real initiation. And as you are all following my instruction, in that matter, the initiator is already there. Now, the next initiation will be performed as a ceremony officially. Of course, that ceremony has value because the name, holy name will be delivered to the student from the disciplic succession. It has got value. But in spite of that, as you are going on chanting, please go on with this business sincerely, and Krishna willing, I may be coming to you very soon." In another letter to Jadurani written on 4th of September 1972, Srila Prabhupada wrote, "The eternal bond between disciples and spiritual master begins from the first day he hears. Just like my spiritual master, in 1922, he said in our first meeting, 'You are educated boys. Why don't you preach this cult?' That was the beginning. Now, it is coming to fact. Therefore, the relationship began from that day." From these quotes of Srila Prabhupada, we can see how Srila Prabhupada placed more emphasis on the transcendental aspects rather than on the ceremonial aspects or the personal or physical aspects of the process of initiation to act.

### transcendental, initiation, essence

**Key Quote:** "But without the transcendental aspects, the ceremonial aspects will not bear fruit."
**Summary:** This section highlights the significance of the transcendental aspects of initiation, such as destroying sins and awakening transcendental knowledge, as the core essence of Diksha.

As Srila Prabhupada says, the ceremony has its place and importance, but without the transcendental aspects, the ceremonial aspects will not bear fruit. Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspect of initiation to the rithwiks, namely, chanting on the beads, selecting the spiritual names, etc. And he delegated to the temple presidents the conducting of the fire yajna, handing over the beads and announcing the name. So like this, Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspects to the rithwiks and to the temple presidents. And Srila Prabhupada started delegating this aspect to the temple presidents and GBCs from as early as 1970. Finally, when Srila Prabhupada had personally overseen the successful implementation of this delegation of the ceremonial aspects as well as the personal or physical aspects over the next seven years from 1970 till 1977, Srila Prabhupada gave it a solid stamp of finality via the directive on July 9th, 1977. Now what Srila Prabhupada did not delegate to his representatives, the temple presidents, the GBCs and the rithwiks is the transcendental aspect of initiation. Let us look at a few more quotes of Srila Prabhupada. In the purport to the Chaitanya Charitamrita Madhyalila, Chapter 15, verse number 108, purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "Srila Jeeva Goswami explains deeksha in his Bhaktisandharbha, verse 283, divyam jnanam yathodadhyat kuryat papasya sankshayam tasma deeksheti saa prokta deshikai statva kovidaihi. Deeksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of the revealed scriptures knows this process as deeksha."

**Key Quote:** "Deeksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the importance of Deity worship as a means to rectify material conditioning and establish a personal relationship with the Lord through initiation.

Further, in the same purport, Srila Prabhupada says, "It is Srimad Bhagavatam's opinion that the process of Deity worship is not actually necessary. Just as the specific prescriptions of the Pancharatra and other scriptures do not have to be followed, the Bhagavatam enjoins that even without practising Deity worship, one can achieve the complete success of human life by any of the other devotional processes, such as simply offering oneself at the Lord's feet for His protection. Nonetheless, Vaishnavas following the path of Sri Narada and his successors endeavour to establish a personal relationship with the Lord by receiving the grace of a bona fide spiritual master through initiation, and in this tradition, the devotees are obliged at the time of initiation to begin engaging in Deity worship. Although Deity worship is not essential, the material conditioning of most candidates for devotional service requires that they engage in this activity. When we consider their bodily and mental conditions, we find that the character of such candidates is impure and their minds are agitated. Therefore, to rectify this material conditioning, the great sage Narada and others have at different times recommended various kinds of regulations for Deity worship." As we can see, the transcendental aspect of initiation consists of destroying the sins of the disciple, awakening the transcendental knowledge in the heart, and taking the disciple back to Godhead, which are actually the crux or the heart or the essence of initiation or Diksha.

### delegation, Rittvik system, transcendental

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "And these aspects cannot be delegated."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that the transcendental aspects of initiation cannot be delegated and must be performed directly by an Uttama Adhikari, explaining how the Rittvik system allows Srila Prabhupada to retain these aspects.

And these aspects cannot be delegated. They have to be performed only by an Uttama Adhikari or Mahabhagavata spiritual master Diksha Guru directly. So, the final table of the different aspects of initiation looks like this. Take a look at this. The first column, physical or personal aspects, were delegated to temple presidents, GBCs, and senior devotees. The second column, ceremonial aspects, were delegated to the rittviks and to the temple presidents. And the third column, transcendental aspects, were retained by Srila Prabhupada. The other aspects of physical or personal presence and ceremony may be even done away with completely, as we can see how Srila Narada Muni initiated Murugari or Dhruva Maharaj. But the transcendental aspects cannot be done away with. Hence, Srila Prabhupada via the rittvik system delegated the two aspects of initiation which are not mandatorily to be performed by an Uttama Adhikari: The physical or personal aspects and the ceremonial aspects. Both of these can be done by devotees who may not be on that Uttama Adhikari platform. At the same time, Srila Prabhupada continues to retain the transcendental aspect of initiation, and thus, he continues to rule the hearts of those who become devotees of Krishna by reading his books and becoming attached to his temples. So, you can see from this table that these arguments like rittvik system is not valid because there is no guru to instruct on service, according to tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya words, does not hold good because that's a personal or physical aspect which may not be essential. Then, there is no guru to clear your doubts. Even that is not applicable in the rittvik system. And there is nobody to correct the devotees, the disciples' mistakes. Even that doesn't hold good. So, all the arguments which are brought up against the rittvik system is centered around the personal or physical aspect which has been already addressed in the rittvik system of initiations. Prabhupada has already addressed it. So, using those arguments, you cannot invalidate the rittvik system of initiations because if you see the entire system of giving deeksha, the personal or physical aspect and the ceremonial aspect are only one portion of the entire deeksha vidhana, the process of deeksha, and they are not the most important part of deeksha. The most important part of deeksha is the transcendental aspect which Prabhupada is doing, he is continuing to do, which he was doing before 1977 and even now also he is continuing to do without the necessity of his personal physical presence.

**Key Quote:** "Even before 1977, all the transcendental aspects of the deeksha was being performed by Prabhupada without requiring his personal physical presence."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses arguments against the Rittvik system, stating that they focus on the physical aspects, while the transcendental aspects, which are the most important, are still being performed by Srila Prabhupada.

Even before 1977, all the transcendental aspects of the deeksha was being performed by Prabhupada without requiring his personal physical presence. There were so many devotees in ISKCON who got initiated who might never have met Srila Prabhupada but all the transcendental aspects were fully fulfilled. So therefore, these kind of arguments which are focusing on the personal or physical aspect to say that a living guru is essential is looking at the whole process of deeksha in a very narrow frame and therefore we should not get caught up by these kind of arguments which are not having a proper overview of the entire initiation process. Thus we can see clearly that there is nothing against tradition or any law of disciplic succession. None of these things are being violated by the Rithvik system instituted in ISKCON by Srila Prabhupada personally particularly for the time when Srila Prabhupada is no longer with us.

**Summary:** The speaker defends the Rittvik system, emphasizing its authenticity and the dangers of alternative systems developed by less enlightened individuals, referencing Prahlada Maharaj's warning about blind leaders.

The very fact that Srila Prabhupada built up this system of initiations over several years between 1970 and 1977 just like he did with all other aspects of the transcendental organization of ISKCON speaks volumes about the efficacy and authenticity of the Rithvik system. This Rithvik system of initiations was given to us by a fully enlightened personality with transcendental vision. Any other system developed by persons who are not similarly enlightened is fraught with dangers and pitfalls. Like Srila Prabhupada often quoted Prahlada Maharaj who said that blind people following blind leaders are bound to end up in a ditch. The ISKCON Mumbai Group's GBC has invented a system of a managerial board indicating no objection to Diksha Gurus in ISKCON. There is absolutely no evidence to support this invention of no-objection gurus. There is no evidence either by way of tradition or parampara or shastra or Srila Prabhupada's direct order. And by their own admission in their resolution number 409 of 2004 they don't know if anybody in ISKCON is a pure devotee or not. Any system like this no-objection guru system in ISKCON which has been invented by such conditioned souls is definitely pervaded by the defects of cheating, errors, illusions and imperfections. Hence, the Rithvik system of initiations ordered by Srila Prabhupada the pure devotee in ISKCON who is beyond all the four defects which plague the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai is the safest path for those whose goal in life is to go back to Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "Avoid the Rithvik system at your own peril which is actually what the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group has said in their resolution number 409 of 2004"
**Summary:** The lecture concludes with a strong critique of the ISKCON Mumbai group's 'no-objection guru system,' arguing that it lacks scriptural support and urging devotees to follow Srila Prabhupada's directive to implement the Rittvik system.

Avoid the Rithvik system at your own peril which is actually what the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group has said in their resolution number 409 of 2004 and the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group for those who keep asking in which tradition is a Rithvik system of initiations followed please think before you ask. Every tradition has a beginning somewhere. The beginning will be some Acharya or the other. Acharyas have the authority and the power to start new traditions. The question that Rithvik system has never been followed in any tradition presumptuously assumes that Srila Prabhupada is not empowered he is not authorized he is not powerful enough to start new traditions. But the GBC thinks that they are better than Srila Prabhupada. Why? Because they can start a new tradition of a managerial board like the GBC indicating no objection to Diksha Gurus. But Srila Prabhupada is not powerful enough to start a new tradition of a Rithvik system of initiations. This kind of attitude of the GBC towards Srila Prabhupada is very offensive, and this question of asking about tradition to support the Rithvik system of initiations ordered by Srila Prabhupada is actually very disrespectful towards Srila Prabhupada. Hence instead of asking Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group devotees in which tradition is the Rithvik system of initiations practiced the devotees of the ISKCON Mumbai group should be questioning their GBC about their resolution number 409 of 2004 which states that when the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating it does not thereby endorse him as an Uttam Adhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. Rather the GBC indicates that it has no objection to saying that the devotees of the ISKCON Mumbai group should please ask their GBC in which tradition is it found that a GBC body indicates no objection to allow devotees to act as a Diksha Guru. Also please ask them why they are not obeying Srila Prabhupada's order on July 9, 1977 to conduct initiations in the ISKCON Mumbai group. The devotees of the ISKCON Mumbai group should conduct initiations in ISKCON via Ritviks. That is the real question to be asked. Instead of following the offensive no objection Guru system of the ISKCON Mumbai group please follow Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group's system of Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive to implement Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON and remain free from offences to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada. Hare Krishna Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada

**Summary:** The speaker discusses GBC Resolution No. 405, which mandates daily guru puja for Srila Prabhupada for all devotees in ISKCON.

In reaction to the constant guru fall-downs, the GBC has been chopping and changing the unauthorized guru system as well as their understanding of the functions, qualifications, and characteristics. In the year 1999, the GBC passed Resolution No. 405, titled Standards of Guru Worship in ISKCON, and the GBC made it into a law in ISKCON. It has become an ISKCON law. As part of this ISKCON law, the GBC resolved, under subsection C of this Resolution No. 405, in order to offer appropriate respect to Srila Prabhupada as founder acharya and pre-eminent spiritual master of ISKCON. It is considered an essential devotional practice for all ISKCON devotees to observe or perform Srila Prabhupada's guru puja daily, either in an ISKCON temple or, if not possible, in one's home. So, the GBC made it mandatory for all devotees in ISKCON, irrespective of who was their diksha guru, to perform guru puja for Srila Prabhupada daily, either in the temple or at home.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that while daily guru puja is mandated for Srila Prabhupada, guru puja for diksha gurus is limited to once a year and is optional, and that all disciples are to be instructed that Srila Prabhupada is their pre-eminent Shiksha Guru.

While the GBC mandated daily guru puja for Srila Prabhupada, in subsection D of the same resolution of the same ISKCON law, the GBC resolved this about their unauthorized diksha guru puja. With an aim to focus more fully on Srila Prabhupada, and every devotee's special relationship with him and to correct any imbalance in application between the respect offered to shiksha gurus, diksha gurus or other senior Vaisnavas contributing to a devotee's spiritual progress, an ISKCON shiksha or diksha guru may have public Guru Puja, Aarati and or foot bathing in person once a year on ISKCON property as a Vyasa Puja. So, the disciples of the unauthorized Gurus may offer, may offer means it's not mandatory, it is optional. The disciples may offer Guru Puja to their Gurus in person only once a year in ISKCON. Further, in subsection J, the GBC law states, at the time of diksha initiation, all disciples will be further instructed by their initiating guru that Srila Prabhupada is their pre-eminent Siksha Guru as ISKCON's founder Acharya, ever present in His books and teachings. Thus, they have a recognized Siksha Guru.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the significance of considering Srila Prabhupada as the pre-eminent Shiksha Guru and analyzes the meaning of the Sri Guru Vandana, particularly the phrase 'Shri Guru Charanapadma'.

So, the disciples of the Unauthorized Gurus may offer Guru Puja to their Gurus in person link to Srila Prabhupada. That means, in ISKCON, every devotee is supposed to consider Srila Prabhupada as his pre-eminent Shiksha Guru, except, of course, for those initiated before 1978. So, for their pre-eminent Shiksha Guru, Srila Prabhupada, the devotees during the Guru Puja, sing the Shri Guru Vandana song penned by Shri Launarothamadas Thakur daily, every day, mandatorily. In this song, that every devotee in ISKCON must compulsorily sing for Srila Prabhupada every single day of his life, it begins with Shri Guru Charanapadma Kevala Bhakati Sadma, meaning, Srila Prabhupada's lotus feet are the shelter of Shri Guru. In the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 15, verse 108 purport, Srila Prabhupada quotes Shri Launarothamadas Thakur from his Bhakti Sandarbha, where Shri Launarothamadas Thakur says, Deeksha Vidhanena Shri Guru Charana Sampaditam. Shri Launarothamadas Thakur translates this as, Receiving the Grace of a bona fide spiritual master through initiation. That means, receiving the mercy of Guru or Shri Guru Charanapadma happens through initiation. In other words, Shri Guru Charanapadma in the Guru Vandana refers to the Deeksha Guru, not just to some preeminent Deeksha Guru. And then, the devotees, have to sing, Vandohmui Savadahana Mate, meaning, I bow down to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada with great awe and reverence.

Of course, the one who takes the responsibility to deliver the devotee across the material existence to the lotus feet of Krishna? Is it the responsibility of the Shiksha Guru or is it the responsibility of the Diksha Guru?"
**Summary:** The speaker questions whether the Shiksha Guru or the Diksha Guru is responsible for delivering the disciple from material existence, referencing Srila Prabhupada's statements in the Chaitanya Charitamrita.

So, every devotee in ISKCON has to take shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada. What is the meaning of taking shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada? We will come to that a bit later, towards the end of the Guru Vandana. Please bear with us till then. For now, let us go on to the next line. And what is that next line? Jahara Prasade Bhai, Ebhava Toriyajai, Krishna Prapti Hoi Jaha Hoite. Meaning, by Srila Prabhupada's grace, because we are singing this song for Prabhupada, this is an offering to Prabhupada, so by Srila Prabhupada's grace, we can cross over the material existence and we can attain Krishna. That means, every devotee in ISKCON must sing every single day of his life that he can cross over the material existence and attain Krishna by Srila Prabhupada's grace. Now, the question arises that who takes the responsibility to deliver the physical life of the human being? Of course, the one who takes the responsibility to deliver the devotee across the material existence to the lotus feet of Krishna? Is it the responsibility of the Shiksha Guru or is it the responsibility of the Diksha Guru? Let us see what Srila Prabhupada says in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 9, verse 61, purport. There, Srila Prabhupada says, it is the spiritual master who delivers the disciple from the clutches of Maya. How? By initiating him into the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. So clearly, it is the responsibility of the Diksha Guru to deliver the disciple from the material existence.

### Diksha Guru, Material contamination, Srila Prabhupada, Spiritual perfection, ISKCON GBC

**Key Quote:** "So if the Diksha Guru delivers one from material contamination, why are the devotees in Eskan mandated to sing every day that it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers them from material existence?"
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the apparent contradiction in ISKCON's mandate for devotees to sing about Srila Prabhupada delivering them from material existence, while limiting the glorification of their Diksha Gurus.

In the Nectar of Instruction, purport to verse 7, Srila Prabhupada says, if one is sincere, he is initiated and this stage is called Bhajanak Kriya. One then actually engages in the service of the Lord by regularly chanting the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra 16 rounds daily and refraining from illicit sex, intoxicants, meat-eating and gambling. By Bhajanak Kriya, one attains freedom from the contamination of materialistic life. So if the Diksha Guru delivers one from material contamination, why are the devotees in ISKCON mandated to sing every day that it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers them from material existence? Instead of their Diksha Guru, they can sing about the Diksha Guru only once a day in a year. Whereas, they are singing every day to Srila Prabhupada 365 days a year, that it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers them from material existence. It is Prabhupada who delivers them from there, from the material existence. So how is it that the Shiksha Guru is delivering the disciple from the clutches of material existence whereas the Shiksha Guru is not doing it? While you ponder over that point, the whole situation becomes more complicated when the devotee sings the next line, Jai Prasad-e-Pure Sarva Asha, meaning that by Srila Prabhupada's song, all our desires for spiritual perfection will be fulfilled. So it is very clear that ISKCON GBC accepts that irrespective of who initiates the devotees in ISKCON, it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers the devotee from material existence. It is Srila Prabhupada who gives them Krishna and it is Srila Prabhupada who blesses them with spiritual perfection.

### Transcendental vision, Spiritual master, Diksha Guru, Eternal spiritual master, ISKCON devotees

**Key Quote:** "But in the Sri Guru Vandana, ISKCON devotees are mandated to sing daily that Srila Prabhupada is their eternal spiritual master."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that ISKCON devotees are mandated to sing daily that Srila Prabhupada is their eternal spiritual master, questioning why the GBC directs devotees to consider Srila Prabhupada as their eternal spiritual master instead of their Diksha Guru.

Not only that, the song for Srila Prabhupada further goes, Chakudana Dilo Jai, Janmai Janmai Prabhu Sai, meaning every devotee in ISKCON, irrespective of who initiates him, accepts that Srila Prabhupada has given them the gift of transcendental vision, Chakudana Dilo Jai and that Srila Prabhupada is their spiritual master, life after life, Janmai Janmai Prabhu Sai. In the Krishna book, chapter 80, Srila Prabhupada says, there may be many spiritual masters who are initiated, but the initiator spiritual master is one. Initiator spiritual master is one, meaning life after life, he only is our Diksha Guru. No one else can be our Diksha Guru once we have taken initiation from a bona fide Diksha Guru. But in the Sri Guru Vandana, ISKCON devotees are mandated to sing daily that Srila Prabhupada is their eternal spiritual master, which is actually the point. This is the proposition of the Diksha Guru, not of just some pre-eminent Diksha Guru. Then why in the world is the GBC telling the devotees that they have to consider Srila Prabhupada as their eternal spiritual master, life after life, and not their so-called Diksha Guru?

**Key Quote:** "That Srila Prabhupada reveals transcendental knowledge in the heart."
**Summary:** The speaker points out that devotees sing that Srila Prabhupada reveals transcendental knowledge in the heart, which is a function of the Diksha Guru, according to Vedic injunctions.

Well, if that is not enough, next comes an even bigger blow to the unauthorized Guru system. This is what we have to sing in the Sri Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada, that Srila Prabhupada reveals transcendental knowledge in the heart. And in the Chaitanya Charitamrita Madhyalita, Chapter 4, verse 111 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, Diksha actually means initiating a disciple with transcendental knowledge by which he becomes freed from all material contamination. You see, and in a lecture given on July 9th, 1971, Srila Prabhupada said this. In the Vedic injunction, it is stated that in order to learn that transcendental science, one must have taught the Guru or the spiritual master. Without approaching a spiritual master, there is no possibility of attaining enlightenment. This is what the Vedic injunction says. You see, and in a lecture given on July 9th, 1971, Srila Prabhupada said this. You see, and in a lecture given on July 9th, 1991, Srila Prabhupada said this. Without approaching a spiritual master, there is no possibility of attaining transcendental knowledge. So, Diksha, Divyam Jnanam Khyapati, the beginning. So that means, transcendental knowledge comes from the Diksha Guru. So, Divye Jnan Hurde Prakashito refers to the Diksha Guru, not to just any pre-eminent Shiksha Guru.

**Key Quote:** "So, the spiritual master is the mercy incarnation of Krishna. Which spiritual master? Preeminent Shikshaguru or initiating Dikshaguru, initiating spiritual master? Which spiritual master is this referring to?"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how Srila Prabhupada is glorified as the ocean of mercy, the incarnation of Krishna's mercy, which is a characteristic of the Diksha Guru, questioning why the GBC mandates this glorification.

As if that was not enough, the devotees have to further sing to Srila Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada says, Krishnadekar, Krishnadekar, Krishnadekar, Krishnadekar. Guru Karunasindhu that Srila Prabhupada is the ocean of mercy. Again, in the Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita, Antalila, chapter 7, verse 12 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, the true Acharya, the spiritual master of the entire world, must be considered an incarnation of Krishna's mercy. So, the spiritual master is the mercy incarnation of Krishna. Which spiritual master? Preeminent Shikshaguru or initiating Dikshaguru, initiating spiritual master? Which spiritual master is this referring to? Srila Prabhupada explains in Srimad Bhagavatam, canto 4, chapter 21, verse 31 purport, as Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions of a person, immediately, upon his surrender unto him. Similarly, the external manifestation of Krishna, the representative of Krishna, who acts as the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple, immediately after the disciple's initiation. So, it is the spiritual master who gives initiation to the disciple. So, it is the spiritual master who gives initiation to the disciple. The Dikshaguru, who is the mercy incarnation of Krishna. So, why has the GBC mandated to all the devotees in ISKCON to glorify Srila Prabhupada daily, that Srila Prabhupada is the ocean of mercy, the Karuna Sindhu, meaning the manifestation of mercy of Krishna, or in other words, the Dikshaguru, that Srila Prabhupada is the Dikshaguru, and not one of the unauthorized Gurus, indicated no objection by the GBC.

**Key Quote:** "Haha Prabhu Karo Daya Deho More Paadachchaya, meaning, Srila Prabhupada, our spiritual master, please give us the shelter of your lotus feet."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the meaning of seeking shelter at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, connecting it to taking initiation from him, implying that Srila Prabhupada is acting as a Diksha Guru for all devotees in ISKCON.

So, if this much wasn't enough, next comes the killer punch. Going further, the devotees have to sing, Haha Prabhu Karo Daya Deho More Paadachchaya, meaning, Srila Prabhupada, our spiritual master, please give us the shelter of your lotus feet. Haha Prabhu Karo Daya Deho More Paadachchaya, meaning, Srila Prabhupada, our spiritual master, please give us the shelter of your lotus feet. Like the Sri Guru Vandana began with Vandomui Savadhana Mate, I bow down at your lotus feet with great reverence. Similarly, once more, the prayer here is seeking shelter at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada. So, we had told you at the beginning that let us wait towards the end of this Sri Guru Vandana to understand what is this seeking the shelter of the lotus feet mean? In the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 4, Chapter 29, Verse 55, purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this. Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. Not only that, in the Nectar of Devotion, Chapter 6, Srila Prabhupada says, all together, Srila Rupa Goswami mentions twenty items and all of them are very important. Out of the twenty, the first three, namely accepting the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, taking initiation from him and serving him with respect and reverence are the most important. So, taking shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, haha means to take initiation from Srila Prabhupada. So that means Srila Prabhupada is acting as a diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON by giving them shelter at his lotus feet.

**Summary:** The speaker questions the GBC's logic in mandating the Sri Guru Vandana for Srila Prabhupada while limiting the glorification of Diksha Gurus, highlighting the incongruity of the situation.

On the one hand, ISKCON Mumbai Group's GBC has declared that Srila Prabhupada is only a pre-eminent siksha guru. Although, Krishna alone knows what that means because the GBC has not defined what the word quote-unquote pre-eminent siksha guru means. I personally have tried searching for this term pre-eminent siksha guru in the Veda base. But honestly, I couldn't find even one reference where Srila Prabhupada uses this term pre-eminent siksha guru. In case you happen to come across any instance of Srila Prabhupada using the term preeminent shiksha guru, please do share with us and we will be grateful to you for that. Until then, some questions for the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai and its unauthorized gurus and their supporters. If Srila Prabhupada is just a shiksha guru, preeminent or whatever term you want to call it, if Srila Prabhupada is just a shiksha guru for your group, then why have you made it mandatory for all the devotees to sing Sri Guru Vandana prayers for Srila Prabhupada? Which means, line after line, they have to pray to Srila Prabhupada as their diksha guru. And the GBC has said, every day the devotees have to do this. Why has the GBC forbidden the devotees in ISKCON from singing Sri Guru Vandana for their so-called diksha guru's daily and instead the GBC has told them to direct it to Srila

**Key Quote:** "So actually, by the GBC's own rules and laws, Srila Prabhupada is acting as the diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON."
**Summary:** The speaker outlines the functions and characteristics of a Diksha Guru and argues that the GBC's own rules and laws demonstrate that Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling these roles for all ISKCON devotees.

Prabhupada? Isn't this incongruous? Why this confusion? Actually, if we see the functions and characteristics of a diksha guru, what are they? The functions and characteristics of a diksha guru are, number one, he is a shiksha guru. Number two, to give shelter to the disciple by initiating him or her. Number three, to remove all the sinful reactions of the disciple, kuryatpapasesankshayam. Number four, to reveal transcendental knowledge within the heart of the disciple, divyam jnanam yathodadyat. And then, number five, to be the spiritual master for the disciple, life after life, eternally. And number six, to be the spiritual master for the disciple, to act as the manifestation of the mercy of Krishna. All these are functions of the diksha guru. And what does the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group do? They have mandated that all the initiated devotees in ISKCON, irrespective of who their diksha guru is, they should sing daily to Srila Prabhupada all these aspects, which are meant actually for the diksha guru. And simultaneously, they have prohibited the disciples from singing the same thing to their so-called diksha gurus, except for one day in a year. And that too, optionally, not mandated. So actually, by the GBC's own rules and laws, Srila Prabhupada is acting as the diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON. And they are affirming that by singing Sri Guru Vandana for Srila Prabhupada day in and day out. Well, if Srila Prabhupada is performing the diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON, they are performing the all these functions of a diksha guru. Then, what are the unauthorized diksha gurus doing in ISKCON? What are they doing? What are their functions towards their disciples? What are their characteristics? Do they really do anything for their disciples at all? Or do they simply give a mala and a name in a ceremony and that's it? But that is what a Rithvik does, not what a diksha guru does. So, do the unauthorized gurus perform all these functions of a diksha guru? Match anything of what is sung about Srila Prabhupada daily in every ISKCON temple across the world by every ISKCON devotee. No matter who he has taken diksha from, whoever may

**Key Quote:** "The GBC simply said in one line that none of the diksha gurus in ISKCON have any of the characteristics or perform the functions of a diksha guru."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes GBC resolutions regarding the qualifications of Diksha Gurus and concludes that Srila Prabhupada is the only qualified Diksha Guru in ISKCON.

be his diksha guru, he has to sing this Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada. Well, the only thing that the GBC has ever said about its unauthorized gurus is in their resolution 409 of 2004, where they have said, When the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating, it does not thereby endorse him as an uttamaadhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. The GBC simply said in one line that none of the diksha gurus in ISKCON have any of the characteristics or perform the functions of a diksha guru. Whereas, all of those functions and characteristics are attributed to Srila Prabhupada by the GBC by asking all devotees to mandatorily, compulsorily sing Sri Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada daily without fail, irrespective of where they are, whether at temple or at home, you have to sing daily. And the GBC further, in resolution 409 of 2004, has informed all the devotees, saying that, Therefore, each prospective disciple, before initiation, should become familiar with the qualifications mentioned in Srila Prabhupada's books as those that a spiritual master ought to have, and decide for himself which senior devotee, if any, to approach for initiation. Within this context, the choice of whom to select as one's spiritual master is ultimately not that of the GBC. The GBC has also surfaced since the dawn of the GBC's failure to support the practice of possibility within the GBC. All devotees, including those who have not yet ascended into GBC, are gaining the knowledge of GBC and the GBC's that they have not yet attained connections to GBC. They have not yet become very familiar with the GBC or GBC model. Ultimately, the prospective disciple's own responsibility. So, every devotee in the ISKCON Mumbai group, it is your responsibility to determine whether the Diksha Guru in ISKCON is qualified to be a Diksha Guru or not. And well, if you, the devotees in ISKCON Mumbai group were to compare these two statements of the GBC with the position of Srila Prabhupada through the GBC authorized and mandated Sri Guru Vandana, then an intelligent devotee can only conclude that it is Srila Prabhupada alone in ISKCON who is actually the Diksha

**Key Quote:** "So, this aptly fits Prabhupada according to this definition given by Sri Jiva Goswami and Srimad Bhagavatam. And so, Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling these functions and characteristics."
**Summary:** The speaker presents a detailed comparison table, highlighting how Srila Prabhupada fulfills the functions and characteristics of a Diksha Guru, while the unauthorized gurus, according to GBC resolutions, do not.

Guru. Just take a look at this comparison table. Here we have in the first column, the functions and characteristics of Diksha Guru. So, the first point is that Srila Jeevagaswami in Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu says, Diksha Vidhanena Shri Guru Charana Sampaditam, receiving the grace of a bona fide spiritual Master through initiation. And in the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1, Chapter 1, verse 15 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, anyone therefore who takes shelter of the lotus feet of a pure devotee by accepting the pure devotee as his spiritual Master can be at once purified. So, in the Shri Guru Vandana that the devotees have to sing to Prabhupada, what do we sing? Shri Guru Charana Padma Kevala Bhakati Sadma. The lotus feet of the spiritual master are the abode of pure devotional service. So, this aptly fits Prabhupada according to this definition given by Sri Jiva Goswami and Srimad Bhagavatam. And so, Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling these functions and characteristics. And what about the unauthorized gurus as declared by the GBC? The answer is no, they don't perform this function because as per GBC Resolution 409 of 2004, they have declared that none of the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON are pure devotees or Uttama Adhikaris or have achieved any state of specific state of realization. So, they do not fit this characteristic. Then the next one, the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 4, Chapter 29, Verse 55, purport, Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. And as far as Srila Prabhupada is concerned, every devotee has to sing every day, Vandho Mui Savadana Mate, I bow down to those lotus feet with great care and attention. And also, Haha Prabhu Koro Daya Deho More Padachaya. We have to sing to Prabhupada, O Master, be merciful unto me and give me the shade of your lotus feet. So, this condition is fulfilled by Srila Prabhupada. What about this function by the unauthorized Gurus? Well, they give Diksha. This much they do. Then in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 9, Verse 61, purport, It is the spiritual master who delivers the disciple from the clutches of Maya by initiating him into the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. So, how about Prabhupada, according to Sri Guru Vandana, Jahara Prasade Bhai Ebhava Toriyajai Krishna Prapti Hoi Jaha Hoite. It is through the grace of the spiritual master that we cross over this material existence and obtain Krishna. So, Srila Prabhupada fulfils this condition. What about the GBC appointed unauthorized Gurus? It is unclear about whether the Diksha Gurus perform this function or not. Because, some of the people say that it is the Diksha Guru who does it. Some of them say that it is Srila Prabhupada who does it. Some of them say that they don't know who is doing it. Some of them say it is Prabhupada, the Diksha Guru, the Shiksha Guru, the Temple President, the ISKCON as an institution, Prabhupada's books, everything put together who is delivering. So, it is unclear. They don't have a clear stand on this. Moreover, the GBC in their Resolution 409 of 2009, says that the Diksha Guru is the one who does it. So, it is unclear. They don't have a clear stand on this. Moreover, the GBC in their Resolution 409 of 2004 have also stated that none of the Diksha Gurus are pure devotees or Uttama Adhikaris or have achieved any specific state of realization. So, unless they are a pure devotee, they cannot deliver anyone. So, from that perspective, from that Resolution, the unauthorized Gurus in ISKCON are not delivering their disciples.

**Summary:** Continuing the comparison, the speaker emphasizes that Srila Prabhupada provides transcendental knowledge and is the eternal spiritual master, while the unauthorized gurus lack these qualities according to GBC resolutions.

Next in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 15, 108 purport, Srila Jeeva explains Diksha. In his Bhakti Sandarbha, Divyam Janam Yathodadyat, Kuryat Papase Sankshayam, Tasma Diksheti Saproktah, Deshika is Tatva Kovidaihi. Diksha is the process by which one can awaken its transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of revealed scriptures knows this process as Diksha. And to Srila Prabhupada, we have to sing every day, Chakudan Dilojai, He has given me the gift of transcendental vision. And Divya Jnan Hriday Prakashito, by His mercy, divine knowledge is revealed within the heart. So Prabhupada is performing this function as per the GBC. As far as the unauthorized Gurus are concerned, no, they are not doing anything because they are not pure devotees, they are not uttama adhikaris, they have not achieved any specific state of realization as per the GBC Resolution of 409. Next, in the Krishna book, Chapter 80, Prabhupada says, there may be many spiritual masters who instruct. But the initiator spiritual master is one. And so, in the Sri Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada, we sing Janme Janme Prabhu Se, He is my spiritual master life after life. That means Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling this criteria that He is the only spiritual master for us eternally. And as per the GBC Resolution of 409, the spiritual masters are not pure devotees, they are not uttama adhikaris, they have not achieved any specific state of realization, they are silent. So, this is the answer to all the questions that we are getting on whether these unauthorized

**Key Quote:** "That Srila Prabhupada is the sole Diksha Guru for ISKCON."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes that Srila Prabhupada is the sole Diksha Guru for ISKCON, advocating for the implementation of the Ritvik system of initiations and urging devotees to follow Srila Prabhupada's July 9th order.

Diksha Gurus are eternally the Diksha Gurus for their disciples or not. So, it is unclear. When it comes to the next point from the Srimad Bhagavatam, 4th Canto, 21st verse, Chapter 31 purport, as Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions of a person immediately upon his surrender unto Him, similarly, the external manifestation of Krishna, the representative personality of Godhead takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple immediately after the disciple's initiation. And in the Sri Guru Vandana, the devotee has to sing to Srila Prabhupada, Sri Guru Karuna Sindhu, Adama Janara Bandhu. The spiritual master is an ocean of mercy, the friend of the poor. So, Prabhupada is the mercy incarnation of Krishna and it fulfils this criterion. And as far as the GBC is concerned, they have said that the gurus, the diksha gurus in ISKCON are not pure devotees. They don't have any specific state of realization. So, are they taking the sinful reactions of the disciples? It is unclear. They are saying that some of the diksha gurus, they claim that they are taking it. Some of the diksha gurus are claiming it is Prabhupada who takes. Some of them say that how can we burden Srila Prabhupada with the sins of our disciples and all kinds of opinions exist in ISKCON on this front. And so, it is unclear who is taking the sinful reactions of the disciples. So, when we look at this table, there is only one positive thing that the unauthorized diksha gurus in ISKCON are doing. What is it? They are giving diksha. So, apart from giving so-called diksha, what are the diksha gurus in ISKCON doing? There may be 100 plus devotees calling themselves diksha gurus, but none of them perform any of the functions of a diksha guru described in Sri Guru Vandana sung for Srila Prabhupada daily. And nor do any of them fulfill any of the quotes of Srila Prabhupada on diksha guru on initiating guru. So, ultimately, even if you go by these GBC resolutions, an intelligent and well-informed devotee can come to only one conclusion. And what is that? That Srila Prabhupada is the sole Diksha Guru for ISKCON. And that is what Srila Prabhupada too confirmed in the July 9th, 1977 order to all temple presidents and GBCs that he is the spiritual master, he is the Diksha Guru and everybody who takes initiation in ISKCON are his disciples even after his disappearance. So, without getting confused, please follow the July 9th order of Srila Prabhupada implementing the Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON and accept Srila Prabhupada as the sole Diksha Guru in ISKCON through this Ritvik system of initiations and do not be misled by the unauthorized Guru system in ISKCON. Hare Krishna, Vishwa Guru, Srila Prabhupada ki Jai.

**Key Quote:** "The real deeksha or initiation involves a bona fide guru and surrender from the disciple."
**Summary:** The lecture begins by posing questions about the initiations of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Gaukishor Das Babaji Maharaj, setting the stage for a discussion on guru-disciple relationships and the concepts of siksha and diksha in the Vaishnava tradition.

Who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and who initiated Srila Gaukishor Das Babaji Maharaj? In the Vedic culture, the father, the sanyasi, and the brahmana are automatically given the respect and position of a spiritual master. But when such a natural spiritual master turns out to be an atheist like Hiranyakachapu, then he is nothing more than an official guru or a pseudo guru. The real deeksha or initiation involves a bona fide guru and surrender from the disciple. In the ISKCON Mumbai group, their GBC has based their self-appointed guru system on Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur's official acceptance of deeksha from someone who was not an acharya in our parampara. Hare Krishna, Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki jai! Who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur? Was Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj the siksha guru of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur? And who initiated Srila Gaukishor Das Babaji Maharaj? Who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur? Was Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur the siksha guru of Srila Gaukishor Das Babaji Maharaj? These questions may be swirling in the minds of those who happen to hear the claims that our guru parampara is a siksha parampara. That means the acharyas in our sampradaya are primarily of a siksha relationship or deeksha relationship. But what does Srila Prabhupada say about this matter? To know about this, first, let us understand some basic concepts before we hear Srila Prabhupada on...

**Summary:** This segment discusses the concept of a 'natural spiritual master' (father, sanyasi, brahmana) in Vedic culture, contrasting it with the idea of an 'official' or 'pseudo' guru, using the example of Hiranyakashipu to illustrate the dangers of a guru who is an atheist.

In a lecture on the Bhagavad Geeta, chapter two, verses four and five, given on August 5th, 1973, Srila Prabhupada said, So, in the Krishna book in chapter 80, Srila Prabhupada mentions that the father is the natural spiritual master of the child. Similarly, in the Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada mentions, the sanyasi and the brahmana are also natural spiritual masters. What does this mean, natural spiritual master? This means that in the Vedic culture, the father, the sanyasi, and the brahmana are automatically given the respect and position of a spiritual master because they are all expected to play that role of a spiritual master. It is expected that they are qualified as spiritual masters. But when such a natural spiritual master turns out to be an atheist like Hiranyakachapu, then he is nothing more than an official guru or a judo guru. In another lecture on Srimad Bhagavatam, 7th canto, 9th chapter, verse...

**Key Quote:** "Guru has to be accepted who is actually paramārthi, advanced in spiritual knowledge, not the formality."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on different types of gurus, including 'jnata-guru' (guru by caste) and 'laukika guru' (hereditary guru), emphasizing the importance of accepting a 'paramarthi guru' who is advanced in spiritual knowledge rather than simply following formalities.

we have accepted somebody as guru, but he's a demon. You should be rejected immediately. Just like in India, there is a system of jnata-guru, the guru by car. By family-wise, they become guru. One family is attached to another guru family. By hereditary rules, the sons after sons accepting guru, the other party, and there is regular business. So such kind of guru is not wanted. See, Jīva Gosvāmī has recommended that loki guru, this is loki guru. Parityagela adhyātmik paramārthi guru accepted. Guru has to be accepted who is actually paramārthi, advanced in spiritual knowledge, not the formality. That is seconded by Jīva Gosvāmī. So here, Śrīla Prabhupāda is mentioning another example of an official, or a judo guru, or a laukika guru. A guru who is accepted according to hereditary rules,

**Key Quote:** "However, the hereditary consideration is not acceptable to Vaishnavas."
**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on different types of gurus, including 'caste gurus' and 'hereditary gurus,' highlighting that hereditary considerations are not acceptable in Vaishnavism and that initiation from such gurus is only 'official' and not truly effective.

which are simply material rules. This type of hereditary guru is mentioned by Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Chaitanya Charitāmṛta also. There in the Madhya Līdhā, Chapter 8, verse number 128, purport, Śrīla Prabhupāda says, sometimes a caste guru says, ye kṛṣṇa-tattva-veitāse guru-haya means that one who is not a brāhmaṇa may become a sikṣā-guru or a vartma-pradarśaka-guru, but not an initiator-guru. According to such caste gurus, birth and family ties are considered foremost. However, the hereditary consideration is not acceptable to Vaishnavas. So, from all these statements of Śrīla Prabhupāda, we can see that official gurus or Judo gurus or Lākika gurus or hereditary gurus, spiritual masters accepted according to culture, such as the natural spiritual masters, spiritual masters accepted according to hereditary considerations, those who are born in a certain caste or son of a guru, he automatically becomes a guru, etc. According to caste, etc., these are all not real spiritual masters. And initiation taken from such gurus is only official initiation and is not the real initiation. Such official initiation is not effective. Initiation or dikṣā may become official either if the guru is an official guru or Judo guru or if the disciple is not committed

**Key Quote:** "The official initiation has no meaning. Unless one was fully surrendered to guru, there is no question of initiation."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of surrender in the process of initiation, stating that 'official initiation' is meaningless without full surrender to a bona fide guru, and that real diksha requires both a qualified guru and a surrendered disciple.

to the dikṣā. Śrīla Prabhupāda in a lecture on the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, 1st canto, 2nd chapter, verse number 20, recorded on 24th of July, 1974, says, The official initiation has no meaning. Unless one was fully surrendered to guru, there is no question of initiation. Dibhagyana hṛde prakāśi. Dibhagyana means transcendental knowledge. So, to play tricks with guru, to become diplomat and introvert, to become a guru, to become a leader, these rascals will not help. You can get some other things, some material profit, but spiritual life will be spoiled. This means that the real heart of initiation or dikṣā is surrender by the disciple. Therefore, the real dikṣā or initiation involves a bona fide guru, not an official or Judo guru. And without these two things, the initiation is only official initiation, which is meaningless. Now we have understood what is meant by official guru and official initiation. We have also seen that the surrender of the disciple is what really constitutes initiation.

**Key Quote:** "Śrī Vyāsadevā is the original spiritual preceptor for all men, and all other preceptors are considered to be his representatives."
**Summary:** This segment explores the term 'preceptor' as used by Srila Prabhupada, equating it with 'acharya' and emphasizing the importance of receiving the transcendental message through the bona fide process of hearing from a spiritual master in the guru parampara.

Next, let us look at one more terminology that Śrīla Prabhupāda uses, which is preceptor. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, purport to 1st canto, 1st chapter, verse 5, Śrīla Prabhupāda says, śrī vyāsadevā is the original spiritual preceptor for all men, and all other preceptors are considered to be his representatives. Obviously, here Śrīla Prabhupāda says spiritual preceptor or preceptor to be his representative. It is important to understand this principle. He says, to mean the Acharya or spiritual master like Vyasa Deva. That means someone who is in the Guru Parampara. Again, in Srimad Bhagavatam, purport to Canto 1, chapter 13, verse 15, Srila Prabhupada mentions about Vidura. He was quite competent to occupy the post of an Acharya or spiritual preceptor. Here also, Srila Prabhupada uses the word spiritual preceptor as an equivalent of Acharya. Again, in the purport to Srimad Bhagavatam, 3rd Canto, 19th chapter, 32nd verse, Srila Prabhupada again uses the word preceptor in the same sense of Acharya. So, there Srila Prabhupada says, Thus, he accepted as bona fide. The system of Parampara or receiving the transcendental message in disciplic succession. Unless received by this bona fide process of hearing from a spiritual master, the statement of an Acharya or preceptor cannot be valid. So, like this, in many places, we can see, Srila Prabhupada uses the word preceptor as an equivalent of an Acharya.

### Bhaktivinoda Thakur, Gaur Kishore Das Babaji, siksha guru, diksha guru, official, preceptor

**Key Quote:** "So far as your second question, Thakur Bhaktivinoda was not the official spiritual master of Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj."
**Summary:** This segment begins to address the central question of the lecture, quoting a letter from Srila Prabhupada stating that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not the 'official' spiritual master of Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj, but was treated as a preceptor due to his elevated spiritual understanding.

Now, let us come to what Srila Prabhupada says on the matter of initiation of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. In a letter that Srila Prabhupada wrote to Dayananda, written on 1st of May, 1969, Srila Prabhupada says, So far as your second question, Thakur Bhaktivinoda was not the official spiritual master of Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj was already renounced daughter, Paramahamsa. But, Thakur Bhaktivinoda, while he was even playing the part of a householder, was treated by Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj as preceptor, on account of his highly elevated spiritual understanding, and thus, he was always treating him as his spiritual master. The spiritual master is divided into two parts: namely, Shiksha Guru and Diksha Guru. So, officially, Bhaktivinoda Thakur was like Shiksha Guru. He was like the Shiksha Guru of Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. So here, Srila Prabhupada is clearly mentioning that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not the official, please underline, official spiritual master of Shila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. But, officially, again underline, officially, he was like his Shiksha Guru. Like his Shiksha Guru means, he was not actually Shiksha Guru. From official point of view, that means in material point of view or from the point of view of custom or tradition that was prevalent in the society at that time, it appeared like Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was the Shiksha Guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj.

### Bhaktivinoda Thakur, Gaur Kishore Das Babaji, diksha guru, surrender

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "In other words, Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his Diksha Guru."
**Summary:** This segment argues that despite the 'official' designation, Srila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his Diksha Guru, implying that surrender and acceptance are key factors in determining the guru-disciple relationship.

This was only on the official front. But Prabhupada says Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his preceptor, which means spiritual master or acharya, as we have seen how Shaila Prabhupada uses the word preceptor elsewhere, which means a Diksha Guru in the parampara or acharya. In other words, Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his Diksha Guru. So, Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj surrendered to Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, accepting him as his Diksha Guru, treating him as his Diksha Guru. Not only that, Shaila Prabhupada here mentions that spiritual master are of two kinds, Diksha Guru and Shiksha Guru. So, if Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not really the Shiksha Guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj, then, because Prabhupada says officially he was like the Shiksha Guru, that means he was not a Shiksha Guru, but Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj accepted him as his preceptor. Then, what kind of spiritual master was Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur? Obviously, he was not the Shiksha Guru. So, then the only alternative left is that of Diksha Guru. So, Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was the Diksha Guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj, because Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj treated him like that. He accepted him like that. He surrendered to him like that. In the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Adi Leela, Chapter 1 Summary, Shaila Prabhupada says this, Shaila Vishwanatha Chakravarti Thakur accepted Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji, who initiated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who in turn initiated Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji. So, here, Shaila Prabhupada clearly mentions, unequivocally, that Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur initiated Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj.

**Key Quote:** "Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur initiated Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj."
**Summary:** This segment presents further evidence from Srila Prabhupada's writings, stating unequivocally that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur initiated Srila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj, and that Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur.

In the same vein, Shaila Prabhupada here says that Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj also initiated Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. And this is confirmed by Shaila Prabhupada in the March 20, 1960 edition of Back to Godhead, Volume 3, Part 16, where Prabhupada says, Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was initiated and Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Om Vishnupad, Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Prabhupada, the divine spiritual master of our humble self. Again, here also, Shaila Prabhupada says that Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was initiated by Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji. So, from all of this, it is clear that officially or from material point of view, in terms of maybe social custom or tradition or hereditary practices or caste or whatever practices were prevalent in the society at that time, Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj might not have appeared to be the diksha guru of Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. And Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, in turn, might not have appeared to be the diksha guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj in the eyes of the material people.

**Key Quote:** "But from spiritual consideration, Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj was indeed the diksha guru of Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was indeed the diksha guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj."
**Summary:** This segment concludes that while 'official' or 'material' considerations might suggest otherwise, from a spiritual perspective, Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj was the diksha guru of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, and Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was the diksha guru of Srila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj.

But from spiritual consideration, Shaila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj was indeed the diksha guru of Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Shaila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was indeed the diksha guru of Shaila Gaur Kishore Das Babaji Maharaj. This is the conclusion we can draw. The official Diksha Guru, the Diksha Guru accepted according to hereditary customs or traditions or whatever. The official Diksha Guru of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who may have been accepted in terms of social customs, tradition, hereditary practices, caste or any other material reason, whatever it is. It might have been someone else, not Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj. But for all practical purposes, Srila Prabhupada quotes Srila Jeev Goswami to emphasize that such official Diksha has no relevance, no meaning in spiritual life and therefore such official Diksha Gurus find no mention in the teachings of Srila Prabhupada about who were the official Gurus of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur or of Srila Gaur Keshavar Das Babaji Maharaj, because they are simply not relevant and they have no meaning. So, in fact, Prabhupada says such official Diksha Gurus are to be rejected.

### ISKCON Mumbai, GBC, official diksha, laukika guru, paramarthika guru, Srila Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "He is the sole Diksha Guru of ISKCON as declared by Srila Prabhupada himself in his July 9th 1977 Directive"
**Summary:** This segment criticizes the ISKCON Mumbai group's guru system, arguing that it is based on a misunderstanding of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur's 'official' acceptance of diksha, and concludes that Srila Prabhupada is the sole Diksha Guru of ISKCON.

As Srila Prabhupada quotes Srila Jeev Goswami, which brings us to the current unauthorized Guru system in the ISKCON Mumbai group. Their GBC has based their self-appointed Guru system on Srila Prabhupada, the Bhaktivinoda Thakur's official acceptance of Diksha from someone who was not an Acharya in our Parampara or who was not a pure devotee. So, the GBC quotes this to justify their stand that the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON need not be pure devotees. But as we have seen until now, such official Diksha Gurus are accepted. The Bhaktivinoda Thakur's official acceptance of Diksha Gurus from someone who was not an Acharya in our Parampara or who was not a pure devotee. So, the GBC quotes this to justify God by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was Laukiki. It was only official and had no spiritual significance, no spiritual meaning. And Srila Prabhupada quoted Srila Jeevakaswami to say that such Laukika Guru is to be rejected. Parityagena. And a Paramarthika Adhyatmika Guru has to be accepted for Diksha. So this means that all of ISKCON Mumbai group's Diksha Gurus who are indicated no objection by the GBC are based on the official or Laukika Diksha Guru example of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur which means as per Srila Jeevakaswami, they are all to be rejected. Parityagena. All the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON are only official or Laukika Gurus. Then who is the Paramarthika Guru? Who is the Paramarthika Guru to be accepted as Diksha Guru in ISKCON? The answer is that is only His Divine Grace Vishwaguru Abhay Charanarvinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. He is the sole Diksha Guru of ISKCON as declared by Srila Prabhupada himself in his July 9th 1977 Directive which is followed by ISKCON Bangalore group.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the GBC's resolution stating that Krishna delivers devotees through various manifestations of His mercy and poses the question of whether this aligns with Srila Prabhupada's teachings.

The GBC of ISKCON Mumbai Group, in its Resolution No. 303, titled GBC Statement on the Position of Srila Prabhupada, has stated that, Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the original Guru, whose divine grace descends through the medium of the Guru Parampara. As such, a devotee is ultimately delivered by Sri Krishna, acting through a combination of various manifestations of His mercy. These include, but are not limited to, the Chaitya Guru, Srila Prabhupada, the Guru Parampara, one's Diksha Guru, other Siksha Gurus, the Holy Name, Shastra and the nine processes of devotional service. So, according to this Resolution of the GBC, who delivers an ISKCON devotee from material entanglement? This is the question before us today. According to the GBC, it is Sri Krishna, acting through a combination of various manifestations of His mercy, such as the Chaitya Guru, Srila Prabhupada, the Guru Parampara, one's Diksha Guru, other Siksha Gurus, the Holy Name, Shastra, Navaveda Bhakti, and many more like this.

### Diksha Guru, Spiritual Master, Deliverance from Ignorance, Surrender

**Key Quote:** "The spiritual master is therefore worshipped as one who delivers the disciple from the mire of ignorance with the light of the torch of knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada's purport to Srimad Bhagavatam 3.25.8, emphasizing the role of the spiritual master (Diksha Guru) in delivering the disciple from ignorance and leading them to freedom.

So, we will see, is this statement of the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai Group backed by Srila Prabhupada's teachings and Shastra? Continue listening to find out. In his purport to verse 8 of chapter 25 of the third canto of the Srimad Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada says, "This verse is very instructive, since it indicates the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple. The disciple or conditioned soul is put into this darkest region of ignorance and therefore is entangled in the material existence of sense gratification. It is very difficult to get out of this entanglement and attain freedom. But if one is fortunate enough to get the association of a spiritual master, like Kapila Muni or his representative, then by his grace, one can be delivered from the mire of ignorance. The spiritual master is therefore worshipped as one who delivers the disciple from the mire of ignorance with the light of the torch of knowledge. The word Paragam is very significant. Paragam refers to one who can take the disciple to the other side. This side is conditioned life. The other side is the life of freedom. The spiritual master takes the disciple to the other side by opening his eyes with knowledge. We are suffering simply because of ignorance. By the instruction of the spiritual master, the darkness of ignorance is removed and thus the disciple is enabled to go to the side of freedom. It is stated in Bhagavad Gita that after many, many births, one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, if after many, many births, one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is able to find a bona fide spiritual master and surrender to such a bona fide representative of Krishna, one can be taken to the side of light." So, well, please note Shaila Prabhupada's opening statement of this purport that these words indicate the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple. These are Prabhupada's words. In other words,

### Diksha Guru, Spiritual Master, Deliverance, Srila Prabhupada's Teachings

**Key Quote:** "So, very clearly from this purport, we can see that Shaila Prabhupada taught that it is the Diksha Guru who delivers the disciple, not the Siksha Guru or anyone else."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes Srila Prabhupada's purport, highlighting that Prabhupada repeatedly emphasizes the Diksha Guru as the deliverer of the disciple, contrasting it with the GBC's resolution.

these words are specifically about the relationship between the Diksha Guru and his disciple. Therefore, this purport which we have just now gone through is very relevant to our current discussion. And in this purport, Shaila Prabhupada says no less than five times, yes, you heard it right, five times that it is the Diksha Guru who delivers the disciple. The first place, Shaila Prabhupada says, "It is very difficult to get out of this entanglement and attain freedom. But if one is fortunate enough to get the association of a spiritual master like Kapilamani or his representative, then by his grace," whose grace, the spiritual master's grace, "one can be delivered from the mire of ignorance." So, here clearly, Shaila Prabhupada says that the Diksha Guru is the one who delivers the disciple. Then again, Shaila Prabhupada says a second time in the purport, "The spiritual master is therefore worshipped as one who delivers the disciple from the mire of ignorance with the light of the torch of knowledge." Again, Diksha Guru is worshipped as the one who delivers the disciple. Then a third time, Shaila Prabhupada says, "Paragam refers to one who can take the disciple to the other side. This side is conditioned life. The other side is not. The other side is the life of freedom. The spiritual master takes the disciple to the other side by opening his eyes with knowledge." So, that's the third time. As if that were not enough, a fourth time, Shaila Prabhupada says, "By the instruction of the spiritual master, the darkness of ignorance is removed and thus the disciple is enabled to go to the side of freedom." So, it is the instruction of the Diksha Guru that removes the darkness of ignorance. That removes the darkness of ignorance of the disciple, enabling him to achieve freedom. Then, a fifth time, Shaila Prabhupada says in this very purport, "It is stated in Bhagavad Gita that after many, many births, one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, if after many, many births, one is able to find a bona fide spiritual master and surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one is able to surrender to such a bona fide representative of Krishna, one can be taken to the side of light." Only if one gets a bona fide Diksha Guru, can one be taken to the side of light. Let me remind you that Shaila Prabhupada began this purport, how? By saying that this verse is very instructive about the spiritual master and his disciple. Hence, we have to understand that wherever in this purport, Shaila Prabhupada is taking into account the spiritual master, it must refer to Diksha Guru because that is the specific subject of discussion in the verse and the purport. So, very clearly from this purport, we can see that Shaila Prabhupada taught that it is the Diksha Guru who delivers the disciple, not the Siksha Guru or anyone else.

### Diksha Guru, Holy Name, Deliverance, Responsibility, GBC Resolution Critique

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees
**Key Quote:** "On the other hand, the responsibility of delivering the disciple is taken by the Diksha Guru, solely by the Diksha Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the role of the Holy Name and other devotional practices, stating that the Diksha Guru is the primary deliverer, empowered to engage the disciple in these practices, and criticizes the GBC's resolution for diluting this responsibility.

So, then the question may arise, what is the role of the holy name and all the other items mentioned as the combined deliverers in the GBC resolution like the holy name, the Siksha Gurus, etc. Well, Shaila Prabhupada says this in the purport to the 61st verse of chapter 9 of Madhya Leela in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita. "It is the spiritual master who delivers the disciple from the clutches of Maya by initiating him into the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra." So, we can understand that the deliverer is one. And who is that? The Diksha Guru. To deliver the disciple, the Diksha Guru initiates him into chanting the holy name, performing Navaveda Bhakti, worshipping the Deity, etc. Yes, all these are essential in the deliverance of a conditioned soul. But if we ask, who delivers the devotee? The answer is not that it is Krishna through a combination of Diksha Guru, Siksha Guru, holy name, Navaveda Bhakti, etc. as erroneously resolved by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group. On the other hand, the responsibility of delivering the disciple is taken by the Diksha Guru, solely by the Diksha Guru. We have to understand that everyone's responsibility is nobody's responsibility. The holy name may be there. Krishna may be there. Siksha Gurus may be there. Navaveda Bhakti may be there. Deities may be there. But one person has to take the responsibility of delivering the disciple. It cannot be left to some vague combination of everyone together delivering the devotee. That one person who takes the entire responsibility of delivering the disciple is the Diksha Guru. For delivering the disciple, the Diksha Guru is empowered by Krishna to engage the disciple in worshipping the holy name by chanting a prescribed number of rounds, in worshipping the deity, in executing Navaveda Bhakti, etc. In other words, if one chants the holy name, executes Navaveda Bhakti, hears many Siksha Gurus, but doesn't have a Diksha Guru, then none of them will take responsibility to deliver the devotee. Only when the devotee surrenders unto a bona fide Diksha Guru, will the Diksha Guru take responsibility to deliver the disciple.

### Diksha Guru, Holy Name, Empowerment, Blessings, GBC Resolution Critique

**Audience:** Full-time devotees
**Key Quote:** "But, without the grace of a bona fide Diksha Guru, it is impossible to be delivered."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to emphasize the necessity of a bona fide Diksha Guru for deliverance, citing Srimad Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita, and argues that the GBC's resolution diminishes the Diksha Guru's power.

In the Srimad Bhagavatam, canto 4, chapter 24, verses 31 and 32 purport, Srila Prabhupada says this, "When a mantra is chanted by a great devotee, the mantra becomes more powerful. Although the Hare Krishna Mahamantra is powerful in itself, a disciple, upon initiation, receives the mantra from his spiritual master. For, when the mantra is chanted by the spiritual master, it becomes more powerful." So, it is clear that the holy name, Navaveda Bhakti, Shastra, the Guru Parampara, etc. are all acting to deliver the devotee. But, without the grace of a bona fide Diksha Guru, it is impossible to be delivered. Eventually, as Srila Prabhupada said, if a devotee doesn't have a bona fide Diksha Guru, but is chanting the holy name, executing Navaveda Bhakti, etc., then, the Paramatma will guide the devotee to a bona fide Diksha Guru, and then, that bona fide Diksha Guru will take the disciple back to Krishna, back to Godhead, delivering him from the material entanglement. On the other hand, if one has everything, the holy name, Navaveda Bhakti, Shastra, Parampara, etc., but has no bona fide Diksha Guru, then, he cannot be delivered. Srila Prabhupada says, in his purport to the verses 8 through 12 of the 13th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, "Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Krishna, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciples following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation." If the Diksha Guru bestows his blessings upon his disciple, then, the disciple becomes immediately advanced without following any of the regulated principles like Navaveda Bhakti, chanting prescribed number of rounds, etc. That is the power of the bona fide Diksha Guru. And where does the Diksha Guru get such power? From Krishna Himself. Because it is Krishna who has directly empowered the Diksha Guru like that. But, the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group has diluted the power of the Diksha Guru by saying that it is not the Diksha Guru who delivers the disciple. Rather, it is Krishna through many many manifestations of His mercy.

**Key Quote:** "Isn't this statement, isn't this resolution by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group an obfuscation of the truth?"
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the GBC's resolution and questions its validity in light of Srila Prabhupada's teachings, suggesting it might be a way for the GBC to reconcile differing opinions or to compensate for a lack of faith in their own Diksha Gurus.

Let us go through that resolution once again. What does the resolution say? It says, "As such, a devotee is ultimately delivered by Sri Krishna acting through a combination of various manifestations of His mercy. These include, but are not limited to, the Chaitya Guru, Srila Prabhupada, the Guru Parampara, one's Diksha Guru, other Siksha Gurus, the Holy Name, Shastra, and the nine processes of devotional service." Do you see how ridiculous this resolution is when you look at all of Srila Prabhupada's instructions on this matter? This is a whole new spin that the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group is giving to the process of deliverance of a disciple by a bona fide Diksha Guru. Isn't this statement, isn't this resolution by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group an obfuscation of the truth? Isn't the GBC contorting the truth to suit its own self-centred agenda? Has the GBC passed such a ridiculous resolution which contradicts Srila Prabhupada's teachings because the GBC believes that its Diksha Gurus are not bona fide, that they are unauthorised. And because they are unauthorised, the ISKCON Gurus are not empowered by Krishna to deliver their disciples. Is it because the GBC knows that the ISKCON Diksha Gurus are not really performing the role of Diksha Guru, which is to illuminate the disciple's heart with transcendental knowledge and to deliver him from all sinful reactions, which is the definition of Diksha Vedana, or in other words, to deliver the disciple from the material world, just as Srila Prabhupada quoted Srila Jeeva Goswami in Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Madhya Leela, chapter 15, verse 108 purport?

### GBC Resolution Critique, Hypocrisy, Srila Prabhupada, Diksha Guru, Deliverance

**Key Quote:** "The deliverer in our group is His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, who delivers all the devotees in our group, because He is our sole bona fide Diksha Guru, empowered directly by Krishna to be the deliverer."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to critique the GBC's resolution, questioning its consistency and suggesting it might be hypocritical. He contrasts this with his own group's belief that Srila Prabhupada is the sole deliverer.

Is this resolution an attempt by the GBC to reconcile the different opinions that exist in ISKCON as to who delivers the devotees? Do all the Gurus and their disciples in ISKCON agree and accept the GBC's version of who delivers the disciple? Very unlikely, because there are many, many divided opinions amongst the Gurus and their disciples in ISKCON on this subject. Everyone in ISKCON has his own opinion as to who delivers the disciples. Somebody says Krishna delivers, somebody says Prabhupada delivers, somebody says the Diksha Guru delivers, etc. Does this resolution number 303 of the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group not smack of hypocrisy, calling its devotees Diksha Gurus, but openly declaring that they are incapable of delivering their disciples? On the one hand, the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group accuses Srila Prabhupada's Rithvik system of initiations of making Srila Prabhupada impotent. But on the other hand, what does this resolution 303 of 2014 speak of the potency of the ISKCON unauthorized Gurus? Are the unauthorized Diksha Gurus in ISKCON not potent enough to deliver their disciples? We are not sure if the GBC has any answers at all to these questions, as well as the innumerable questions we have raised on the unauthorized Guru system in all our videos till date. Their deafening silence can mean only one thing. What is that? That they have no answer to any of our questions. As far as we at Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group are concerned, you can ask any devotee in our group. Write from a newly joined Bhakta to the senior most GBC in our group, as to who delivers the devotees in our group. You will instantly get one and only one spontaneous and unambiguous answer everywhere without fail, without any confusion, without any doubt. What is that answer? The deliverer in our group is His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, who delivers all the devotees in our group, because He is our sole bona fide Diksha Guru, empowered directly by Krishna to be the deliverer. Hare Krishna Vishwaguru

**Summary:** The speaker shares his personal experience of arriving in Vrindavan during winter and being shocked by the cold.

But you know, I have also been, you know, I was born and grew up in South India. So, when I went to Vrindavan, I went in 2005. So, and unfortunately, I went in February. You know, January, February is the coldest season in Vrindavan. So, I had no idea how winter is in North India. I never went out of South India. You know, Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, these were the areas which I used to roam, until I was, until I joined the temple and then went to Vrindavan. So, I had no idea how winters are in the North India. Maximum winter, I had got exposed to was in Bangalore, you know. Maximum would go down to 20 degrees, 22 degrees. And in Vrindavan, you know how winters are. The maximum, the maximum daytime temperature at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the afternoon will be around 5 degrees or 6 degrees. That's the kind of winter. So, I had no idea. So, you know, we got into a car from the airport and drove down to Vrindavan. And our Vrindavan Chandra Uday Mandir site that is there. At that time, of course, it's not like this currently. It was just plain land. There was absolutely nothing. The torus which you see now, it was still coming up. So, I went and landed there. Got out of the car. As soon as I got out of the car, I immediately got back inside. There was a very cold... As it is, the temperature was cold. On top of that, a cold breeze was blowing. The moment it touched my skin, that's all. I couldn't get out of the car. I immediately jumped back inside the car. I said, I am not going to get out. Then, you know, with me, other Vyopat Prabhu and other devotees were there. They said, hey, if you don't get out, you look very bad. I see all the embassies, they are standing there. Come on, get out. So, with great difficulty, I managed to get out.

So, there are breezes also which are not pleasant. So, sometimes, you know, in the extreme winter, when the breeze blows, it is not pleasing.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that natural disturbances are a result of humanity going against Krishna's will and exploiting material nature, disrupting the balance of the universe.

So, which is what we are experiencing now. Every other day, there is a cyclone. Recently, just recently, you know, Chennai has gone through one cyclone, still not got over the, still the cyclone hangover is still going on, still continuously raining. And few years back, we had the big tsunami. And I think couple of years back, we had a big flood also here. So, these kind of natural disturbances are actually, if you see, they are not meant to be in this world. It is not that this world is like this. No, this world is not like this, not supposed to be like this. This world, Krishna has created in such a way, that it is supposed to be very pleasing and giving lot of peace and comfort to us in our minds, as long as we are executing spiritual activities. The moment we go against the will of Krishna, we go against the laws of nature, we start trying to exploit, material nature as well as other living entities. When that becomes prominent in this material world, what happens is, all the entire system around which this whole material universe is designed, gets disrupted. And when that gets disrupted,

## 🎓 SIKSHA PARAMPARA vs. RTVIK DIKSHA 🔥 | His Grace Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa

### Guru Parampara, Diksha, Siksha, ISKCON, GBC

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "To clear the air of the confusion created by this argument, we need to first understand that there are two separate and unrelated processes being compared here."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the central argument against the Rithvik system, focusing on the distinction between Diksha and Siksha Parampara and the role of the GBC in ISKCON.

An Acharya has to be self-realized, he has to be liberated, and he must be an Uttama Adhikari Paramahamsa Vaishnava. Nowhere in his entire teachings does Srila Prabhupada talk about a person called Vipin Bihari Goswami. Srila Prabhupada never referred to our parampara as Diksha Parampara or Siksha Parampara. Mention of a possibility does not constitute an order. All the Gurus in the Guru Parampara are pure devotees. The capability to take the disciple back to Godhead—he should not give initiation. The GBC's concoction is playing havoc with the society and the lives of innocent devotees. The GBC has the audacity to change Prabhupada's books, to contradict him, to find fault with Prabhupada's words. Not a single shred of evidence that Srila Prabhupada ordered Gurus to be nominated with a no objection indicated by the GBC point. Hare Krishna! Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki Jai! One of the arguments presented against the Rithvik system of initiations which has been instituted in ISKCON by Srila Prabhupada is that our Guru Parampara is a Siksha Parampara. It is not a Diksha Parampara. The oft-quoted example is that of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. It is said that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur took Diksha from one Bipin Bihari Goswami. But this Bipin Bihari Goswami is not an Acharya in the Madhavagodiyas of Vaishnava Sampradaya. There are other such examples too. Hence, those Vaishnavas in good standing, who are not Acharyas in the Guru Parampara, who may not be Uttama Adhikari, Paramahamsa Vaishnavas, can give Diksha, like Bipin Bihari Goswami, who is not part of the Guru Parampara. This argument is put forward by the supporters of the self-appointed, unauthorized Guru system in ISKCON. They put forward this argument to justify their GBC's unauthorized, no-objection indication of unqualified devotees as Diksha Gurus in ISKCON. To clear the air of the confusion created by this argument, we need to first understand

### Acharya, Guru Parampara, Designation, Authorization

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "A Guru can become Guru when he is ordered by his Guru. That's all. Otherwise, nobody can become Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the process of appointing an Acharya in the Guru Parampara, emphasizing the importance of authorization and designation by the predecessor Guru, using quotes from Srila Prabhupada.

that there are two separate and unrelated processes being compared here. The first process is that of the appointment of an Acharya to the Guru Parampara. An Acharya has to be self-realized, he has to be liberated, and he must be an Uttama Adhikari, Paramahamsa Vaishnava. Such an elevated Paramahamsa, chosen by Krishna Himself to represent Him, is identified by the predecessor Acharya and appointed as the next Acharya. For example, in this conversation, an Indian man asked Srila Prabhupada, "When did you become the spiritual leader of Krishna Consciousness?" Srila Prabhupada replied, "What is that?" Brahmananda clarified, "He is asking, When did you become the spiritual leader of Krishna Consciousness?" Srila Prabhupada immediately replied, "When my Guru Maharaj ordered me." This is Guru Parampara. The Indian man is still pursuing his question. "Did it?" Srila Prabhupada tried to understand. "Don't go very speedily. A Guru can become Guru when he is ordered by his Guru. That's all. Otherwise, nobody can become Guru." In another quote, in the Srimad Bhagavatam, Prabhupada says, "One should take initiation from a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession, who is authorized by his predecessor spiritual master. This is called Diksha Vidhana." And yet, in another room conversation in San Diego, recorded on June 29, 1972, in this conversation, Atre Rishi asked Prabhupada, "How many qualifications does a spiritual master have in terms of being a spiritual master?" And Prabhupada replied, "One qualification. He is a devotee of God. That's all." Atre Rishi continued, "Also, is he designated? Does he have to be designated by the former spiritual master?" Prabhupada immediately, "Oh yes! Oh yes!" So, Atre Rishi, he has to be a devotee. He has to be both surrendered and designated. That is, identifies disciplic succession, both surrender and designation. And in another lecture on the Nectar of Devotion, Srila Prabhupada said this, "Similarly, bona fide Guru means, he must be authorized by the superior Guru. Just like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, Amarajnaya Guruhaya Tare Desha He must receive the order from superior. And the superior must be bona fide. Then he is bona fide, not self-made."

### Guru Parampara, Initiation, Bhaktivinoda Thakur, ISKCON Mumbai

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Successor Acharya need not be necessarily initiated by the predecessor Acharya."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the argument that Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not initiated by his predecessor, clarifying that direct initiation is not always necessary for being part of the Guru Parampara, and criticizing ISKCON Mumbai's interpretation.

So, from this, what we have to note is, Successor Acharya need not be necessarily initiated by the predecessor Acharya. Although, there is no rule that prevents such an event happening. For example, Srila Prabhupada was initiated by his predecessor Acharya, His Divine Grace Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. And Srila Prabhupada was chosen by him to be the next Acharya. On the other hand, this is the argument given by the self-appointed Guru Saraswati. The supporters, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Gaurakeshwar Das Babaji Maharaj were not initiated by their respective predecessor Acharyas. This is the claim of the supporters of the self-appointed Guru system in ISKCON. How far their claim is true is debatable. Because, Srila Prabhupada in the Chaitanya Charitamrita Adi Leela Chapter 1 Summary says, "Srila Viswanatha Chakravarti Thakur accepted Srila Jagannath Das Babaji, who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who in turn initiated Srila Gaurakeshwar Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Om Vishnupada, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, the divine master of our humble self." So, although ISKCON Mumbai's group claims that Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur was not initiated by Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada says that Bhaktivinoda Thakur was initiated by Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj. Nowhere in his entire teachings does Srila Prabhupada talk about a person called Bipin Bihari Goswami. So, just to justify their self-authorized Guru system, the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group is finding fault with Srila Prabhupada himself and blatantly contradicts Srila Prabhupada. Be that as it may, the fact is that in a Guru Parampara, the Acharya ordered by the predecessor Acharya need not be initiated by him.

### Disciplic Succession, Diksha, Siksha, Possibility vs. Order

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Mention of a possibility does not constitute an order."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes Srila Prabhupada's letter to Kirtananda, arguing that disciplic succession doesn't require direct discipleship and that Prabhupada's statements about future disciples do not constitute an order to initiate.

Here is what Srila Prabhupada says in this letter to Kirtananda written on 25th of January 1969. "Another point is that disciplic succession does not mean one has to be directly a disciple of a particular person." So, without taking shelter of the Bipin Bihari Goswami argument, we see that Srila Prabhupada in 1969 itself said that disciplic succession doesn't necessarily mean one has to be a direct disciple of the predecessor spiritual master. So, does that mean that ours is a Siksha Parampara? Well, Srila Prabhupada never referred to our Parampara as Diksha Parampara or Siksha Parampara. These are concoctions of the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group just to confuse the devotees and make them think that their self-appointed Guru system is authorized. Srila Prabhupada always referred to our Parampara as Guru Parampara or disciplic succession. So, let us stick to Srila Prabhupada's terminology. That's safe. But still, does that mean that taking Diksha from a Guru who is not a pure devotee is alright? Well, in the same letter to Kirtananda on 25th of January 1969, Srila Prabhupada elaborates this. "Regarding your question about the disciplic succession coming down from Arjuna, it is just like I have got my disciples. So, in the future, these many disciples may have many branches of disciplic succession." Now, here, let me clarify. Prabhupada is talking about a possibility. So, talking about a possibility is not an order. So, this sentence, this statement by Prabhupada that just like I have got my disciples, so in future, these many disciples may have many branches of disciplic succession, does not mean that they have to initiate on their own. For example, the Prime Minister of India may say, "There is a possibility of war with Pakistan." Does that mean that the army chief immediately says, "Oh, Prime Minister said that there is a possibility of war. So, immediately go out and attack Pakistan." No, mention of a possibility does not constitute an order. So, Prabhupada here is just mentioning a possibility. It may be possible. So, this does not constitute an order.

### Disciplic Succession, Arjuna, Vyasadeva, Pure Devotee

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All the Gurus in the Guru Parampara are pure devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker continues analyzing Srila Prabhupada's letter, using the example of Arjuna and Vyasadeva to illustrate that even without direct initiation, one can be an Acharya if connected to the disciplic succession through pure devotees.

So, Prabhupada further goes on to say, "So, in one line of disciples, we may not say another name coming from a different line. But this does not mean that person whose name does not appear was not in the disciplic succession. Narada was the spiritual master of Vyasadeva and Arjuna was Vyasadeva's disciple, not as initiated disciple, but there was some blood relation between them. So, there is connection in this way. And it is not possible to list all such relationships in the short description given in Bhagavad Gita as it is. Another point is that disciplic succession does not mean one has to be directly a disciple of a particular person. The conclusions which we have tried to explain in our Bhagavad Gita As It Is, is the same as those conclusions of Arjuna. Arjuna accepted Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and we also accept the same truth under the disciplic succession of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Things equal to the same thing are equal to one another. This is an axiomatic truth. So, there is no difference of opinion of understanding Krishna between ourselves and Arjuna. Another example is that a tree has many branches and you will find one leaf here and another leaf there. But if you take this leaf and the other leaf and you press them both, you will see that the taste is the same. The taste is the conclusion and from the taste, you can understand that both leaves are from the same tree." So, this example given in this letter by Srila Prabhupada is that of Arjuna and Vyasa Deva. Arjuna might not be the initiated disciple of Vyasa Deva, but still, he could also be an Acharya. Now, does that mean Arjuna was initiated by someone who was not a pure devotee? Definitely not. Because Srila Prabhupada gives the example of two leaves from the same tree, meaning that, one devotee may be initiated by a pure devotee coming down from one branch, while the predecessor Guru might be coming down from another branch. The predecessor Guru might order this devotee who is initiated from a different branch to become the next Guru in his line. So, both are initiated by pure devotees. Both are pure devotees themselves. In that way, the Guru in the Guru Parampara may not be initiated directly by the predecessor Guru, but he still is initiated by a pure devotee in some other line. Therefore, all leaves taste the same. Meaning, all the Gurus in the Guru Parampara are pure devotees.

### Guru Parampara, Diksha, Appointment, Liberation

**Key Quote:** "The only way a conditioned soul can get connected to the Guru Parampara is the process of Diksha."
**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes between the process of appointing a Guru and the process of a conditioned soul receiving Diksha, emphasizing that Diksha must be taken from an Acharya in the Guru Parampara for liberation.

So, the criterion for appointment to the Guru Parampara as the next Acharya or Diksha Guru is not Diksha by the predecessor Acharya or Siksha, but rather, order by the predecessor Acharya, as we have seen from the previous quotes of Srila Prabhupada which we shared in the beginning. So, this is the process of appointing the Guru. Now, we come to the second process. The second process is separate and unrelated from the above process. What was the above process? The first process is the process of appointing a Guru by the predecessor Guru. So, this is the first process. Now, the second process which is separate and unrelated to this process of appointment of a Guru by the predecessor Guru is that of the deliverance of a conditioned soul. The process of deliverance of a conditioned soul happens by the combination of revelation of transcendental knowledge in his heart and the destruction of all accumulated past sinful reaction. This process, as all of you know, is called Diksha: Divyam Jnanam Yathodadhyat and Kuryat Papasya Sankshayam. For a conditioned soul to obtain Diksha requires that he must search out an Uttamaadhikari, Paramahamsa Acharya who is part of the Guru Parampara and the devotee has to surrender to him and take Diksha from him. Such a conditioned soul cannot be delivered back to Godhead without taking Diksha from a Paramahamsa Acharya of the Guru Parampara. The only way a conditioned soul can get connected to the Guru Parampara is the process of Diksha. So, Srila Prabhupada mentions in this, "If you do not take your initiation from the Sampradaya, then it is useless. Now, there are so many Appa Sampradaya. They do not come in discipling succession but becomes Guru, teacher. Therefore, everything is topsy-turvy. Nobody has got fixed idea what is God. Everyone has created his own philosophy. The whole thing is now confused." So, as we can see in the above quote, initiation must be taken from the Sampradaya. That means the Guru who gives the initiation must be a person who is part of the Sampradaya or who is in the Sampradaya or Guru Parampara.

### Guru, Disciplic Succession, Bona Fide, Initiation

**Key Quote:** "Guru is not manufactured. Guru is in the discipling succession."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Srila Prabhupada on the importance of a Guru being in the disciplic succession and authorized by his predecessor, emphasizing that a Guru must be bona fide and capable of taking the disciple back to Godhead.

Now, in another quote Prabhupada says, "Otherwise one becomes Guru. Anyone, just like nowadays they become, they are manufacturing Guru. Guru is not manufactured. Guru is in the discipling succession. Guru is in the discipling succession. One who strictly follows the footsteps of the Shadgo Swamis." This is from the lecture in the Srimad Bhagavatam. In another place, Prabhupada says, "Our Guru or spiritual master comes down from that discipling succession. It is not that, that somebody all of a sudden becomes Guru and manufactures his own philosophy. We don't accept such nonsense. We must accept somebody who is actually bona fide coming in discipling succession, not others." And yet another place, Prabhupada says, "One should take initiation from a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession who is authorized by his predecessor spiritual master. This is called Diksha Vidhana." So, in this last quote, Prabhupada makes it clear that Guru is in the discipling succession. And in other places, Prabhupada says, the Guru comes down from that discipling succession. In the discipling succession or from the discipling succession means that the Guru has to be one of the 32 personalities mentioned in the Guru Parampara. It cannot be otherwise. Diksha taken from such a Guru results in taking the disciple back to Godhead. So, Prabhupada says in the Srimad Bhagavatam, "According to Shastra, the duty of the Guru is to take the disciple back to Godhead. If he is unable to do so and instead hinders the disciple in going back to Godhead, he should not be a Guru." In other words, from this quote, unless the Guru has the capability to take the disciple back to Godhead, he should not give initiation.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "No one can become Guru in ISKCON without the specific order of Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that the processes of appointing a Guru and a disciple are separate, and criticizes the ISKCON Mumbai GBC's self-appointed Guru system, arguing that it could lead to bringing in unqualified Gurus from outside ISKCON.

Thus, we can clearly see that one process of liberation for a conditioned soul involves Diksha from an Acharya in the Guru Parampara, while the other process of appointment of a successor Acharya does not necessarily involve Diksha. Both processes are unrelated. One is the process of appointment of a Guru and the other is the appointment of a disciple. Both are separate, independent and cannot be compared. We cannot apply the principles of appointment of a Guru to those of the appointment of a disciple or vice versa. Hence, irrespective of whether our Parampara is Diksha Parampara or Shiksha Parampara, no one can become Guru in ISKCON without the specific order of Srila Prabhupada. And such a Diksha Guru must necessarily be a pure devotee, thirty-third in the Parampara. And as we all know, Srila Prabhupada never ordered anyone to become Diksha Guru. Hence, we have to follow the order of Srila Prabhupada given in the July 9th, 1977 Diksha Parampara. And this directive is to be followed in ISKCON to avoid the violation of the principles of Vaishnava Siddhanta. Now, one more important point we must remember is that if we were to accept the argument of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur being appointed by Bipin Bihari Goswami, then the question arises that why should the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group limit the Diksha Gurus to only disciples of Srila Prabhupada, or the disciples of their self-appointed Gurus? Bipin Bihari Goswami was not in the Parampara. So, someone can argue that we can bring in Vaishnavas or devotees from outside ISKCON and declare him also to be a Diksha Guru in ISKCON. Why limit it to only devotees within ISKCON?

**Key Quote:** "The GBC has the audacity to change Prabhupada's books, to contradict him, to find fault with Prabhupada's words."
**Summary:** The speaker accuses the ISKCON Mumbai GBC of creating a self-appointed Guru system without scriptural basis, contradicting Srila Prabhupada, and even changing his books to fit their agenda, leading to the destruction of innocent devotees' spiritual lives.

So, we can see that their argument to justify their self-appointed Guru system can only create more problems in the ISKCON. The GBC of ISKCON Mumbai has created this self-appointed Guru system out of thin air without any reference to Sadhu, Shastra or Guru. They have contradicted Srila Prabhupada and in some cases even changed Srila Prabhupada's instructions to fit their concocted no-objection Guru system. Actually, if you want a proof of this, in the original Chaitanya Charita Amrita Adi Leela Chapter 1 Summary, Srila Prabhupada said this, which we mentioned at the beginning of this discussion. "Srila Vishwanatha Chakravarthi Thakur accepted Srila Jagannath Das Babaji, who initiated Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who in turn initiated Srila Gaurakeshwar Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Om Vishnupada, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, the divine master of our humble self." So, this did not fit into their self-appointed no-objection Guru system. So, what did they do? They changed Prabhupada's books to "Srila Vishwanatha Chakravarthi Thakur accepted Srila Jagannath Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who in turn accepted," replaced the word initiated with accepted, "Srila Gaurakeshwar Das Babaji, the spiritual master of Om Vishnupada, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, the divine master of our humble self." So, we can see how the GBC's concoction is playing havoc with the society and the lives of innocent devotees. The GBC has the audacity to change Prabhupada's books, to contradict him, to find fault with Prabhupada's words. And because of their actions, so many innocent devotees' spiritual lives have been destroyed, because this GBC thrust upon them, without their consent or knowledge, a neophyte devotee as their Diksha Guru. And subsequently, when the neophyte Guru fell down, thousands of devotees who were initiated by him had to suffer spiritual, mental and emotional trauma and agony.

### Guru, Krishna Consciousness, Uttamaadhikari, Rithvik System

**Key Quote:** "One who has understood Krishna as the supreme controller... then he can become Guru. Otherwise, don't try to become Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada on the qualifications of a Guru, emphasizing the need for full understanding of Krishna and criticizing those who become Gurus without proper qualification, ultimately advocating for the Rithvik system.

Srila Prabhupada said in a lecture, "Therefore, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu confirms, Ae Krishna Tattva Veta Sai Guru Haya One who has understood Krishna as the supreme controller, the supreme person, the supreme maintainer, and everything, the supreme ultimate, then he can become Guru. Otherwise, don't try to become Guru. Impersonalist, half understood, partially understood, he cannot become Guru. This is the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's formula. Therefore, first of all, try to understand Krishna. You will understand in such a way that you can refute all others' argument, all others' opposition. There are so many opposing elements. Then you are Guru. Otherwise, you cannot become a Guru. Guru is not so tiny thing or trifle thing that everyone becomes Guru Maharaj. No, that is not Guru. Samahatma Vasudevaha Sarvamiti Samahatma Sudurlabha" So, you heard what Prabhupada said. Half understood, partially understood, he cannot become Guru. Only an Uttamaadhikari Guru in the Guru Parampara can claim to know full and not partial. Conditioned souls cannot know fully. They can only know partially. In other words, conditioned souls cannot become Guru. To become a Guru and to give Diksha is not a trifle thing. It is an extremely serious affair because Guru has to take the disciple back to Godhead. So, there is not a single shred of evidence that Srila Prabhupada ordered Gurus to be nominated with a no objection indicated by the GBC body. How long will the GBC stubbornly refuse to accept the truth and keep coming up with various concoctions just to fulfill their megalomaniacal ambition to become Diksha Guru? How long will the GBC continue to slaughter innocent devotees' spiritual lives to quench their thirst for honour, prestige and worship? Without a direct order from Srila Prabhupada, ISKCON's self-appointed no objection Gurus are not in the Guru Parampara. Thus, the Guru nomination system of ISKCON is unauthorized, while the Rithvik system authorized by Srila Prabhupada in writing via the July 9, 1977 Directive, fulfills all the conditions stipulated for a devotee to take initiation from a Mahabhagavata in the Guru Parampara and go back to Godhead.

### Rithvik System, ISKCON Mumbai, ISKCON Bangalore, Srila Prabhupada

**Key Quote:** "All devotees are requested to reject the self-appointed no objection Guru system promoted by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by urging devotees to reject the self-appointed Guru system of ISKCON Mumbai and to take shelter of the Rithvik system ordered by Srila Prabhupada, as followed by the GBC of ISKCON Bangalore.

The Rithvik process is independent of whether the Guru Parampara is Siksha or Diksha Parampara. Whether the Guru Parampara is Siksha or Diksha Parampara, has no relevance to the process of taking Diksha from Srila Prabhupada via the Rithvik system personally instituted in ISKCON by Srila Prabhupada. Thus, the Rithvik system does not violate any principle, even if our Guru Parampara is considered to be based on Siksha and not Diksha. All devotees are requested to reject the self-appointed no objection Guru system promoted by the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai. Instead, please take shelter of the Rithvik system ordered by Srila Prabhupada on July 9, 1977 and followed by the GBC of ISKCON Bangalore.
