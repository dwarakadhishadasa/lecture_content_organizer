This is Bhaktivinoda Thakur's Sharanagati, quoted from Adi Purana. It's called, chant anyway. It starts like this: Your mind is wandering all over the universe when you chant. Chant anyway. Your mind is wandering to the past and future when you chant. Chant anyway. You are not able to concentrate on Krishna's names while you chant. Chant anyway. You have no taste for chanting. Chant anyway. You have lusty desires. Chant anyway. You are making offenses in chanting. Chant anyway.

**Key Quote:** "There is no vow like chanting the Holy Name. There's no knowledge superior to it."
**Summary:** This segment explains the unparalleled benefits of chanting the holy name, highlighting its superiority to vows, knowledge, meditation, and penance, and its power to grant liberation and joy.

You are not praying to Krishna to help you chant better. Chant anyway. You often chant late at night. Chant anyway. And why, why should you chant despite all the above obstacles? That is why. What is that? There is no vow like chanting the Holy Name. There's no knowledge superior to it. There is no meditation which comes anywhere near it, and it gives the highest result. No penance is equal to it, and nothing is as potent or powerful as the holy name. Chanting is the greatest act of piety and the supreme refuge. Even the words of Vedas do not possess sufficient power to describe its magnitude. It's continuing. Chanting is the highest path to liberation, peace, and eternal life. It's a pinnacle of devotion, heart's joyous proclivity and attraction. See, it's a heart's joyous proclivity and attraction and the best form of remembrance of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** Soulful japa is described as natural to the soul and requiring no special education, the lecture aims to simplify the process by addressing complications and encouraging awareness of one's desires and offering them to Krishna.

As far as soulful japa is concerned, all the atma shaktis that we are talking about, sankalpa vikalpa, preiti, shratha, sharanagati, all these things are natural to the soul. It also does not need any education. So to do soulful japa, you have to be a human being, that's all. You don't need very big education. So much we need to discuss today to do soulful japa, because we have become very complicated. To reduce the complication, we have to tell all these things that might go the way anywhere, at least you catch, know where is your Asha, where is your Ichcha, you identify it's going on, and you have to offer all those things here.

### Can We Serve Krishna in Our Own Way? | HDG Srila Prabhupada | Bg 1.45-46 | 03.08.2024

#### Arjuna's dilemma, rules of war, surrender

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada reads and translates verses from the Bhagavad Gita describing Arjuna's reluctance to fight and his internal conflict on the battlefield.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA. Reading from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 1, Entitled, Observing the Army on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, Verse No. 45: YADIMAM APRATITARAM ASASTRAM SASTRA PANAYAH DATARASTRA RANIHANYOS TANME SHEMATARAM BHAVET. Translation and Purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swamishila Prabhupada: I would consider it better for the sons of Dhritarashtra to kill me unarmed and unresisting rather than fight with them. Purport by His Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swamishila Prabhupada: It is a custom according to kṣatriya fighting principles that an unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, in such an enigmatic position, decided he would not fight if he were attacked. He did not consider how much the other party was bent upon fighting. All these symptoms are due to soft-heartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the Lord. Verse No. 46 I will read myself. Sanjaya uvacha evam uttvarjunasankhe rathopastupa visat visrajya sasaramchapam sotra samvitnam anasah. Translation: Sanjaya said, Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, tossed aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief. Perfect. While observing the situation of his enemy, Arjuna stood up on the chariot, but he was so afflicted, he pleaded with lamentation that he sat down again, setting aside his bow and arrows. Such a trained and soft-hearted person in the devotional service of the Lord is fit to receive self-knowledge. I would consider it better for the sons of Dhritarashtra to kill me unarmed and unresisting rather than fight with them. Sanjaya said, Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.

#### rules of war, surrender, Krishna's order

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You can violate the laws on the order of Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the rules of war for Kshatriyas and discusses the concept of surrendering to Krishna's orders, even if they seem to violate mundane rules.

yadimam apratikaram asastram sastra-pāṇaya. It is the custom between the kṣatriyas, that in the fighting, if the other party hasn't got a weapon to fight, this party will supply him a weapon. Note that the other party without a weapon, and this party will take the opportunity to kill him. This is not the rules and regulation of fighting. There are many rules and regulations of the fighting. Not that because he's my enemy, I shall kill him anyway. No. There are rules and regulations. If the enemy has broken his chariot, he's fallen down on the ground, he's been killed. The other party also will immediately get down from the chariot. Suppose he is fleeing, then if one is on foot and another on the chariot, so he will be in a superior position. Therefore the opposite party must also get down from the chariot and walk with him. That means the defeated enemy should be given all opportunities. So he may not think that unnecessarily, in a weak position, he has been killed. No. So Arjuna says… Arjuna, of course, did later on. When he killed Karna, Karna was without a weapon, and he fell down from the chariot. Karna, after falling down from the chariot, and he was trying to raise the wheel of the chariot from the mud. So Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna that this is the opportunity to kill him. You kill him immediately. So at that time he had no weapons, and he was trying to kill Karna, and he fell down from the chariot. And in that position he was killed by Arjuna, by the order of Kṛṣṇa. This is violating the laws. So you can violate the laws on the order of Kṛṣṇa. You cannot do this. This is surrender. When Kṛṣṇa says that you do this, although it is wrong, you have to surrender. You cannot do that.

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "For this reason, he had to see hell."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada narrates the story of Yudhisthira Maharaja and his hesitation to lie on Krishna's order, highlighting the importance of surrendering to Krishna's will even when it conflicts with mundane morality.

You cannot do it. There is no consideration. Just like in a fight the commander says to the soldiers, do this. His duty is to do that. He should not think at that time what is right or wrong. Just like Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja… He was advised by Kṛṣṇa that Yudhiṣṭhira… Excuse me. Yudhiṣṭhira, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, you go to Dronācārya and inform him that your son is dead. It was a false information. Because Dronācārya will not die if he is not affected with some lamentation. So Kṛṣṇa asked Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira that you go, because you were recognized truthful, dharma-rāja. So when he will say this is also false, he will believe. But Yudhiṣṭhira hesitated. How can I tell a lie? He disobeyed the order of Kṛṣṇa. And he wanted to become very truthful. For this reason, he had to see hell.

#### spiritual platform, Krishna's pleasure, absolute truth
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=482
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Their only consideration is whether Kṛṣṇa is pleased. That's all."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that on the spiritual platform, the only consideration is pleasing Krishna, as He is above mundane duality and His orders are absolute good.

So in the mundane consideration, there are so many things, right and wrong. So long you are on the mundane platform, you have to obey all these right and wrong. But in the spiritual platform, when it is ordered by Kṛṣṇa, He is above all these duality. He is absolute. So even if He says to do something wrong, because He cannot say anything which is wrong, God is all good. If you discriminate God's order from the mundane platform, then you will be misguided. Anyone who has got formed and fixed up faith that whatever God does, whatever God orders, even from mundane calculation it may be wrong, that is right. That is absolute understanding. So those who are... In the spiritual platform, for them, there is no such consideration which is right and which is wrong. Their only consideration is whether Kṛṣṇa is pleased. That's all. If Kṛṣṇa is pleased, by inducing me to do something wrong, I will not hesitate to do it. I shall do it. Because it's Kṛṣṇa.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "You have to get it confirmed from the transparent medium, spiritual master."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes that while on the mundane platform, one must follow rules and regulations and not concoct ideas about pleasing Krishna, but instead seek guidance from a spiritual master.

It's Kṛṣṇa's order. My principle should be, if Kṛṣṇa is satisfied, then everything is all right. But while we are in the mundane platform, we should not concoct the idea that Kṛṣṇa is pleased. Let me do that. No. That you cannot do. You have to follow the rules and regulations. But if you think that it is... You cannot think. Neither you can manufacture. So either you should hear from directly, from Kṛṣṇa directly, or that is not possible because we are not in touch with Kṛṣṇa at the present moment. We are trying to see Kṛṣṇa through the transparent medium of spirituality. So we cannot manufacture that this is Kṛṣṇa's desire. No. You have to get it confirmed from the transparent medium, spiritual master.

#### Arjuna's dilemma, counteraction, surrender
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=664
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But I am not going to fight."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada returns to the verses, explaining Arjuna's reasoning for not wanting to fight, even if it means being killed, and highlighting his internal struggle.

These are the principles. So Arjuna says, yadimāṁ apratikāraṁ. Pratikāraṁ apratikāraṁ. Pratikāraṁ means counteraction. And apratikāraṁ means without any counteraction. So he is informing Kṛṣṇa, that if the other party, dhārta-rāśrā, the sons of Dhrtarāśrā, other party, they kill me while I am not prepared, but that is not the regulation of fighting. So therefore he says, apratikāraṁ. If I am not prepared and they kill me, all of a sudden. This is wrong. So I accept, even they kill me, apratikāraṁ, without I am fully equipped. Asastraṁ. In the fight, one must be equipped with all, all weapons. But while I am not equipped with weapons, or I am not willing to fight, because I am not willing to fight, this has been decided. I cannot kill my kinsmen. Therefore, I am not going to take the step of pratikāraṁ, counteraction. So even in this condition, they come and kill me. Yadimāṁ apratikāraṁ asastraṁ. I am not fully equipped with asa-sastra, weapons. Asastraṁ and sastra-pāṇayaṁ, they are fully equipped with weapons. Rās-rās-rās, rane, hanyu. So in this condition, the other party, my cousin brothers, sons of the rās-rās, if they kill me, rane, hanyu, I shall prefer them. I am not going to fight. If you think that if you don't fight, then they will take the opportunity. He is talking with Kṛṣṇa. He is already giving the counter-argument. Kṛṣṇa, if you think that I don't fight, that they will take the opportunity and kill me immediately, that also I shall prefer. But I am not going to fight.

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna, he is very unhappy because he was beaten by r 가족as, because he first swore that he was a sin."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada describes Arjuna's state on the battlefield, highlighting his unhappiness and the reasons behind it.

This is my decision. Sanjaya-upāca. Sanjaya is the secretary of Dhritarāṣṭra. They were sitting in a room. Ema-muktā, just saying, Arjuna, the person, Arjuna is nominative case. Arjuna, sankhe in the battlefield, rathū-pasta, on the chariot, upāviṣā. You have seen the picture when Kṛṣṇa blew his concert from the backside. Arjuna is just trying to take his arrow and fight. But in the sense of fighting, they are now captured by Arjuna. That is war. And Arjuna is, he is suitable. But Arjuna, he is very unhappy because he was beaten by…

#### counteraction, material world, struggle for existence
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=917
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Material world means step by step, simply danger."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the concept of 'pratikaram' (counteraction) in the material world, where life is a constant struggle against dangers.

It is not traditional money. So apratikāraṁ pratikāraṁ. There are two things. Pratikāraṁ means counteraction. Here in this material world, for everything there is counteraction. Just like if you are diseased, so you have to take the medicine. Pratikāraṁ. That is pratikāraṁ. The disease is caused by some, what is called, disarrangement within the body. So we have to arrange, we have to set up the disarrangement within the body. That is pratikāraṁ, medicine, counteraction. Similarly, if somebody is diseased, he has to take the medicine. If somebody is coming to kill you, so you also become prepared to kill him. This is pratikāraṁ. If somebody is drowning in the sea, then you have to give him some help, send some boat or some lifebuoy so that he can be saved. So we have got so many. This material world is going on. It is full of dangers. Yes. Padam padam yad vipadam. Material world means step by step, simply danger. That is material world. So you have to find out pratikāraṁ, counteraction, how to save yourself from danger. Just like when we walk, we see in so many doors, danger. So that you may be, you are warned. Sometimes the doors are, beware of the door. So you have to take care. No, I shall not enter. So everything, there is danger and there is pratikāraṁ, counter, counteraction, how to save yourself from this. This is called struggle for existence.

#### danger and counteraction, Krishna's purity, rascals

**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "The rascals, they do not know this."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues discussing danger and counteraction, then transitions to emphasizing Krishna's purity and criticizing those who misunderstand Him.

In this material world... There is only this danger and counteraction. I am unhappy, so just to become happy, I have to work. I have to get money, whatever I want. So this is going on, pratikāraṁ, danger, vipadam. Padam padam yad vipadam. Padam padam yad vipadam, natesāṁ. So samāsthita ye pada-pallavam plavam. Anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Samāsthita ye pada-pallavam plavam. Mahat-padam kurna-jaso murāre. Murāre, murāre means Kṛṣṇa. So purna-jaso is simply glorified by pious activities. There is no impious activities in Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the purest. So whatever he does, that is pure. The rascals, they do not know this. They think Kṛṣṇa is immoral, and he has become a professor, teacher. He does not know, he does not understand Kṛṣṇa. So many big, big professor, learners, scholars, they do not understand what is Kṛṣṇa. And they're talking about Kṛṣṇa. They're taking the position of instructing about Kṛṣṇa. Just see how rascals are.

#### knowing Krishna, yoga-siddhi, rascals
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/h8hMfQp6ZFs?t=1176
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Both of them are animals."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses the difficulty of knowing Krishna, the concept of 'siddha' (perfection), and criticizes those who falsely claim to be God without any qualifications.

You do not know something. Perfectly, and still you are talking about it. This is going on. Purna-jaso murāre. What is Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa says, bholam janmalā mante jñānavāṁ mām kṛpady. We have to know Kṛṣṇa. Because as soon as you know Kṛṣṇa, you become immediately independent. So knowing Kṛṣṇa is not so easy thing. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, manuṣyānāṁ śahaśreṣu kaścid yatati siddhayaḥ. First of all, you become siddha, perfect. Perfect means perfect knowledge. That is called siddha. And another siddha means very powerful, master of all yogic perfection. That is also siddha. Yogi is perfection, eight kinds of perfection. Manimā, lagimā, siddhi, prapti, yasitā, bhashitā, prāpaṁ mam. So they update eight kinds of siddhis. They are also called siddhas. From material point of view, a perfect yogi can counteract anything, and whatever he likes, he can do. That is called siddhi, astra-siddhi. But still, he is not as siddha as Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's name is yogi-śara. He is the master of all the yogis. Yogi-śara, yatta-yogi-śara-kṛṣṇa. The yogis also, they are deficient with Kṛṣṇa's power. Still, some rascals, without any yoga-siddhi, they claim that I have become God. What is your qualification? Have you got all the yoga-siddha? Then how you claim that you are? But rascals, they claim to become God, and other rascals, they also believe that here is God.

#### understanding Krishna, power of Krishna, animalism

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "As good as Kṛṣṇa, this is craziness, animalism."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues to emphasize the importance of understanding Krishna's power and criticizes those who claim to be equal to Him, calling it animalistic.

Both of them are animals. Sabai. One who does not know actually what is Kṛṣṇa, if you accept somebody, some rascal as God, then he is also animal. That is also animal. One who is claiming that I am as good as Kṛṣṇa, he is certainly animal, crazy. He does not know what is the power of Kṛṣṇa, how much he is yogi-śara. Still, he is not. He is falsely claiming to become Kṛṣṇa, and one who accepts him as Kṛṣṇa, what is this? So Kṛṣṇa, one should understand first of all Kṛṣṇa. Without understanding Kṛṣṇa, if somebody remarks, if he thinks Kṛṣṇa as ordinary, human being, avajānanti māna-mūḍhā, mānuṣeṁ tanum āśritam, that is the mūḍhā's business, rascal's business. Kṛṣṇa, because He comes as ordinary human being, manuṣya-līlā, if we take Him, Kṛṣṇa, as like me, like ordinary, then I am a mūḍhā. How a human child, at the age of six or seven, seven years, one can lift the whole mountain, Govardhana. Then, first of all, try to understand Kṛṣṇa, how much powerful He is. How a three months old child can kill a big demon, kūtanā. These things are there in the Bhāgavatam about Kṛṣṇa's life. How do you claim to become? As good as Kṛṣṇa, this is craziness, animalism.

#### Krishna's order, Arjuna's role, Bhagavad-gita

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So what is spiritual knowledge?"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that Krishna's order is final and discusses Arjuna's role in the Bhagavad-gita, suggesting that he is playing a part to facilitate the delivery of spiritual knowledge.

So Kṛṣṇa's order must be final. If He says, then everything is all right. So here Arjuna's position is, Kṛṣṇa has already arranged the battle, and He knows that Kṛṣṇa wants this battle. Still He says, that yadīvāṁ apratīkāraḥ, He decides in His own way, this is karmāyāṁa. He knows what is Kṛṣṇa's desire, and still He is speaking His own philosophy. That means Arjuna is placing himself on the position of ordinary man. Ordinary man does not know what is Kṛṣṇa. And what is Kṛṣṇa's desire. And he manufactures his own philosophy and thoughts. That is ordinary man. But Arjuna, he is always friend of Kṛṣṇa, constant friend. His name is Gurā-keśa, above all darkness. Certainly he must be one who is Kṛṣṇa's friend, directly. How there can be ignorance? There cannot be. Then why Arjuna is playing that part? He knows Kṛṣṇa's desire. Still He says, that yadīvāṁ apratīkāraḥ, asastraṁ śastra-pāṇayaṁ, and nūṁ tan-veṣeṁ ata-raṁ. He is playing like that. Because without playing, Arjuna is playing like that, how this Bhagavad-gītā will come? This is just like, just like playing on the stage. One very rich man, he is in a drama, he is playing the part of a very poor man. But actually he is not a poor man. But in the stage he is playing the part of a poor man. Similarly, Arjuna is not bewildered. But for the time being he appears to be bewildered by Kṛṣṇa's māyā. Because Kṛṣṇa wants to speak Bhagavad-gītā for the benefit of the whole world. So what is spiritual knowledge?

#### counteraction, Krishna's sanction, Prahlada Maharaja

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If Kṛṣṇa wants to kill you, nobody can save you. And if Kṛṣṇa wants to save you, nobody can kill you."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that all counteractions are ultimately futile without Krishna's sanction, using the example of Prahlada Maharaja to illustrate this point.

Therefore this is a stage arrangement. So, prati-kāraṁ and aprati-kāraṁ. This whatever we have manufactured, prati-kāraṁ, counteraction, that will be also failure if Kṛṣṇa does not sanction it. That is realized by Prahlāda Mahārāja. He says, my dear Lord, Hīraṇyakāršipu, that people have manufactured so many prati-kāraṁ, counteraction. But tanu-vṛtāṁ those who have accepted this material body they are simply manufacturing things to counteract dangers. But even though they have all these counteracting machines or counteracting agents, still without your sanction these counteracting machine or agent will not be fruitful. Similarly Arjuna is being protected by Kṛṣṇa. So even though Arjuna is not well equipped of prati-kāra, still he will be saved. Because Kṛṣṇa is there. tāvat vibhūtaṁ vṛtāṁ tad-peksitāṇā And even one is well equipped and if Kṛṣṇa does not like to save him, he will not be saved. Always mind this. rāke kṛṣṇa māreke māre kṛṣṇa rākeke This is ordinary. If Kṛṣṇa wants to kill you, nobody can save you. And if Kṛṣṇa wants to save you, nobody can kill you.

**Key Quote:** "The parents of children, they are not actually protector of the children."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues with the example of Prahlada Maharaja, explaining that even parents cannot ultimately protect their children if Krishna wills otherwise.

This is the position. So the examples I have given by Prahlāda Mahārāja. bāla-śaṇīha-saranaṁ pitarau nṛsiṁha My Lord, Nṛsiṁha-deva, the parents of children, they are not actually protector of the children. Because generally we think that this child, this boy has got his father. Father and mother, he is well protected. No. Their father and mother, every father and mother wants to protect the child, but still the child has to meet some danger and dies. There are so many experiences. Similarly, bāla-śaṇīha-saranaṁ pitarau nṛsiṁha The father and mother is a counteraction for the dangers of the child. But Prahlāda Mahārāja said, no, they are not counteraction. It is not that if a child is in danger, because the father and mother is very strong, very rich, he will be able to give protection to the child. No, that is not possible.

**Verse References:** BG 18.66
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Real pratikāraṁ is Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada concludes by emphasizing that even the best medicine cannot guarantee safety if Krishna wills otherwise, and that the ultimate protection comes from surrendering to Krishna.

Then, nārtyasya-cāgadha The medicine, a person is suffering from some disease, some fatal disease. If you think, I shall engage first class physician and I shall supply first class medicine, if you think then it will be, the patient will be safe. No, that is not possible. That is not possible. We have got many experiences like that. Then, no rich man, would have died. Because he has got money, he can employ first class physician, first class medicine, and simply by engaging such things, counteracting, pratikāraṁ. He cannot be safe. There are many examples like that. So the conclusion is, tāvat vibhūtaṁ vṛtāṁ tada pe kṣitānāṁ If you neglect, if you have decided, that this person, this child cannot be safe, then any amount of pratikāraṁ will not help. Will not help. Therefore, real pratikāraṁ is Kṛṣṇa. Real pratikāraṁ is Kṛṣṇa. Counter it. So, better we take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. As Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vrajaḥ. You must always know that no counteraction will be beneficial for us unless we are protected by Kṛṣṇa. So therefore, our business is fully surrender to Kṛṣṇa and seek His protection. Kṛṣṇa says, yes, ahaṁ tvā sarva-pāpebhaṁ mokṣayiṣyāmi, I shall give you protection. This is Bhagavān's Bhagavad-gītā philosophy. We have to believe on the assertion of Kṛṣṇa that He is prepared to give me all protection provided I have fully surrendered unto His lotus feet.

You cannot achieve the platform of devotional service by karma-kāṇḍa and jñāna-kāṇḍa processes. Devotional service should not be contaminated by jñāna-kāṇḍa, karma-kāṇḍa, by fruitive activities or mental speculation. Devotional service should be taken exactly in the line of the great authorities. We have to follow the principles of these six Gosvāmīs. That will make us happy. Otherwise, if we take devotional service as one of the pious activities, subha-kriya, that is offense. We should not take devotional service of chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra equal to some Vedic pious activities, ritualistic ceremony. We should simply follow the path chalked out by the... Devotional service is not dependent on subhā-subha-karmā.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains how Krishna induces Arjuna to fight and emphasizes the importance of chanting Hare Krishna as the beginning of our connection with Krishna.

especially for you, you are my friend. What people will say? So give up this weakness of the heart and stand up, take courage. You just see how Krishna is inducing Arjuna to fight. People are very much ignorant and they sometimes criticize that Krishna is exciting Arjuna. He is very gentleman, non-violent, and Krishna is exciting him to fight. This is called jara-darsana. Jara-darsana means material vision. Therefore, shastra says atasri-krsna-namadi namaved graiham indriyai sri-krsna namadi. We become in touch with Krishna by chanting his name, Hare Krishna. That is the beginning of our connection with Krishna, namadi. The shastra says atasri-krsna-namadi. Adi means beginning. We have no connection with Krishna, but if you chant Hare Krishna maha-mantra, immediately our first chance to contact Krishna begins.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada elaborates on Krishna's name, form, and activities, highlighting the importance of avoiding offenses while chanting to accelerate purification.

So it has to be practiced, not that immediately idealize Krishna. That is not, of course, if one is advanced, it is possible immediately. So shri-krsna-namadi, nam means name. So Krishna, he is not only name, adi, that is the beginning, but form, activities, just like shravanam kirtanam. Shravanam kirtanam, glorifying or describing about Krishna. So he has got his form. So nam means name, and then root means form, lila means pastimes, goma means quality, entourage, his associates. All this adasya shri-krsna-namadi na bhavet na bhavet grāhyam indre. By ordinary senses, we cannot understand either shri-krsna's name. We are hearing that our through the oral reception Krishna's name, but if we keep our ear without purification, of course, by hearing it will be purified. We have to help, help means to avoid the offenses, ten kinds of offenses. So in this way, we shall help the purificatory process. Just like if I want to ignite fire, so I must help the igniting process by drying the wood, it will very soon get fire. Similarly, simply chanting that will help also, it will take time, but if we avoid the offenses, then it will be very quickly purified, the action will be very quickly.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses how ordinary people misunderstand Krishna's behavior and stresses the importance of following the orders of higher authorities rather than imitating them, emphasizing that everything Krishna does is perfect.

There. So this behavior of Krishna, how ordinary man can understand? Because they have got their ordinary senses. Therefore, they mistake why Krishna, in Krishna's devotee, Vaisna, that is also stated, Vaisnaver Kriyam mudra vijyana bujhaya. Even Vaisna Acharya, what he is doing, even the most expert intelligent man cannot understand why he is doing this. Therefore, we should not try to imitate the higher authorities, but we have to follow the order, injunction given by the higher authorities. It is not possible. Krishna is exciting Arjuna to fight, that does not mean we can also do that, excite. No, that will be immoral. For Krishna, it is not immoral. Whatever he is doing is God is good, he is all good. We should have to do it. Whatever he is doing, there is all good. This is one side, and whatever I am doing without authorities order, this is all bad. He does not require any order from anyone else. He is the supreme controller. He does not require anyone's instruction. Whatever he does, it is perfect. This is Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "your business is to chastise the mischief mongers that is your business you cannot excuse the mischief monger"
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that those without transcendental vision misunderstand Krishna and discusses the duty of a Kshatriya to chastise mischief-mongers, advocating for strict capital punishment.

Understanding, and not that I have to study Krishna in my own way. Krishna is not subjected to your examination or your test. He is above all, he is transcendent. Therefore, those who have not the transcendental vision, they misunderstand Krishna. Here he is directly enticing parantapa. Parantapa is this word, very word is used, that you are a kshatriya, you are a king, your business is to chastise the mischief mongers. That is your business. You cannot excuse the mischief monger. Formerly, the kings were so, the king himself used to judge. A criminal was brought before the king, and if the king thought it wise, he would take his own sword, immediately cut his head. That was the duty of king. Even 100 years ago in Kashmir, the king as soon as a thief was caught, he would be brought before the king, and if he is proved that he was a thief, he is stolen, immediately the king will cut off his hands, personally chopped up even 100 years ago. He was a thief even 100 years ago. So all other thieves warned, this is your punishment. If there was no thieving, there is no stealing, no burglary in Kashmir. Even somebody lost something on the road, it will lie down, nobody will touch it. The order and care for you cannot touch it. The man who has left it, he would come, he would collect, you cannot touch it even 100 years ago. So this capital punishment is required. Nowadays, the capital punishment is excused, murderers are not harmed. This is all mistake, no mercy. Why a human killer, even an animal killer should be immediately hanged? That is the kingdom, the king should be so strict.

So this sympathy is like Arjuna's sympathy. This sympathy now the state is sympathizing with the murderer not to be killed. This is Arjuna's, that is that is not duty. One has to discharge the duty ordered by the superior authority very strictly without any consideration. So these are weakness of the heart, this kind of sympathy. But ordinary person will not be able to do anything special senses, special senses, not ordinary senses, special senses means you have to pluck your eyes and you have to put another eyes. No, you do the work, you have to put other eyes on this body, you have to put other eyes on this body, and this body is the center of the soul.

And this rascals, they say, no, you can eat whatever you like, it has nothing to do with religion. बद बेदिक शास्त्यों बहुत बहुत तुम्हारे पर राशिक हो. तो आप जितना कहांगे कौन भी भी भी गुड़ है। अगर आप आपको प्रधान करते हैं, तो आप आपको प्रधान करेंगे। बेली को प्रधान करेंगे। रुपगुष्यामी gives instruction बाचवेगं क्रोधवेगं मुदरवपस्तवेगं मरसवेगं एतानवेगान जविषवेत धीरच प्रिसिरिंग सशिष्यात this is instruction that anyone who has become competent to control the tongue, to control the mind, to control the anger, to control the belly and control the genital if six kind of control is there, he is fit for becoming spiritual master. He can make disciples all over the world. And if you cannot control your tongue, if you control your anger, control your mental concoction, then how you can become even spiritual master?

You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, always glorify बाचांशि वैकुन्ठ कुनानु वर्णने. बाचांशि, means talking. Talking is the business of tongue. And tasting is the business of tongue. So you engage the tongue in the service of the Lord by glorifying. Whenever you take a vow that whenever I shall speak, I shall simply speak glorifying Kṛṣṇa, nothing more. That is tongue control. If you don't allow your tongue to speak anything nonsense, ग्राम्म कथा. We sometimes sit together, we talk so many nonsense. And that should be controlled. Now I have engaged my tongue for the service of the Lord, so we shall not talk anything of sense gratification. This is controlling the tongue. I cannot eat anything which is not

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Compassion for the eternal soul is real self-realization."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the first verse of the second chapter of Bhagavad-gita, focusing on Arjuna's compassion and Krishna's role in dispelling ignorance.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. In Shri Ramasuramad Bhagavate Gita, Chapter 2, Contained Bhagavate Gita, Summarized, Verse 1: Sanjayo Vacha Tam Tathakrupaya Vishtam Ashrupurna Kulekshanam Vishidantam Hidam Vakyam Vacha Madhusudana. Translation in Perpetual Bhai's Divangresh Translation: Sanjayo said, seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his eyes brimming with tears, Madhusudana, Krishna, spoke the following words. Perpetual compassion, lamentation, and tears are all signs of ignorance of the real self. Compassion for the eternal soul is real self-realization. The word Madhusudana is significant in this verse. Lord Krishna killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted Krishna to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress, the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a Shudra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a Kshatriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord Krishna, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad Gita was sung by him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul. As explained by the supreme authority, Lord Shri Krishna, this realization is made possible by working with the fruity being situated in the fixed conception of the real self.

#### devotional service, liberation, Krishna's position

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "That position is greater than to become one with Kṛṣṇa."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada describes the setup of the Bhagavad-gita and contrasts the desire to merge with Krishna with the devotee's desire to serve Krishna, highlighting the superior position of devotional service.

Now, in the first chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā, it is the setup. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, according to the order of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa placed the chariot in between the two soldiers, two flanks of soldiers. Śreṇāya-rūbhāya-maddhe rata-sthāpaya me acyuta. So Arjuna was respectful to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa has accepted to be charioteer, inferior position than Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is on the chariot, sitting on the throne, and Arjuna is sitting on the throne, and Kṛṣṇa has taken the inferior position, driving the chariot. So this is very nice position for devotional service. Those who are not devotee, they aspire to become Kṛṣṇa. Their aspiration is to merge into the existence of the Supreme, or to become one with Kṛṣṇa. But in devotional service, it is not the desire of the devotee to become one with Kṛṣṇa, but sometimes to make Kṛṣṇa as the order-carrier of the devotee. To become one with Kṛṣṇa, it may be a very great position, but to become the commander of Kṛṣṇa, that is another thing.

**Key Quote:** "The devotee does not approach the Supreme for any material gain."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses the five kinds of liberation and emphasizes pure devotion, which is devoid of any material or spiritual gain.

That position is greater than to become one with Kṛṣṇa. So there are five kinds of liberation, sājūrya. The first liberation is supposed to be sājūrya, means to become one with the Supreme. The Māyāvāda philosopher, monist, they aspire after sājūrya-mukti. But the devotees, Vaiṣṇavas, they do not aspire to become one with Kṛṣṇa. They aspire to become one with Kṛṣṇa. They aspire to become one with Kṛṣṇa. And at that time after sājūrya-mukti, there, for them, there are other four kinds of mukti: Sa rūpaḥ salakkaḥ sāsthiḥ sa mipyaḥ. And those who are still further advanced, they do not want any kind of mukti, neither of these five points of mukta is… Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He prays, na dhanam na janam na sundariṁ kavitāṁ vā jagad-dīśa-kāmāyam. This is pure devotional prayer. The devotee does not approach the Supreme for any material gain. Just pure devotion means without any aspiration of any kind of material gain or even spiritual gain. Anyāvilāśitā sunyam jñāna-karmāda-anāvṛtaṁ ānukulyena kṛṣṇaṇu-śrīlanam bhakti-uttamāṁ. Uttamāṁ bhakti, first-class bhakti. What is that? Anyāvilāśitā sunyam, without any kind of desire than to serve the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "Nārāyaṇa is not anything of this material world."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that Krishna, Vishnu, and Narayana are beyond the material world and that the term 'nirakara' means that God's form is not material.

And in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also it is said, sabhi-puṁśāṁ paro dharmaḥ. Paro means transcendental. Beyond this material conception, Kṛṣṇa or the Absolute, Nārāyaṇa, that is paro, Nārāyaṇa-paro of bhakti-āyam. Nārāyaṇa is not anything of this material world. Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He is not anything of this material world. When we use this word nirākā, that means He is not anything of this material world. But He has got His form, that is transcendental form, sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. Nirākār means He has no such form as we have got this material form. This material form is neither of the three transcendental bliss, sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ, this is asat, acit, and nirānanda-vigrahaḥ. This body, this material body is asat, acit, and nirānanda-vigrahaḥ. Therefore when in the Vedic literature on an authorized statement we find nirākār, that means His form does not belong to this asat, acit, or nirānanda-vigrahaḥ.

**Key Quote:** "When we become envious of Kṛṣṇa and we want to enjoy this material world, then we come to this material creation."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the material world is a result of envy towards Krishna and the desire to enjoy separately, leading to the cycle of karma and different forms of life.

Cūta means those who are fallen in the material world. They are cūta. We are fallen in the material world. Therefore, we have accepted this material body. Napāpuraṁ rellenů Institute on the integral consciousness, purpose and sense body. Īcchā. Īcchā means desire, and deśa means envy, enviousness. ícchā deśa samad-tena. When we become envious of Kṛṣṇa and we want to enjoy the good of the average Muslims, we cannot en possession of radiance. enjoy this material world, then we come to this material creation. Icchād deśa-samuttena sarve jānti paraṇṭhaḥ. So any one of us who is in this material world, having a material body, beginning from Brahmā, down to the ant, a small ant, any one of them, in the Brahma-saṅgīta it is said that yastindra-gopo matavendra-maho sakarma bandhāna-rūpa-phala-bhājana-māta-noti. Indra-gopa, there is an insect which is called in Sanskrit language as indra-gropa. It is microbe. You cannot see with this naked eyes. So this microbe is called indra, and there is another indra, the king of him. So the Brahma-saṅgīta is just through indra-gopo and mahendra, this king of him. So the Brahma-saṅgīta is just through indra-gopo and mahendra, this king of him. Beginning from this indra-gopo up to the king of heaven, everyone is subjected to enjoy or suffer the resultant action of this karma. By karma, by resultant action of karma, one has become the king of heaven, and by similarly… This, by karma, resultant action of karma, one has become the microbial insect.

**Key Quote:** "He identified himself as the body."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada describes how everyone in the material world is attached to their body and identifies with it, which is what happened to Arjuna on the battlefield.

This is the material body. There are 8,400,000 types or forms of this material body, and we are wandering, sarva-gata, in different planets, in different forms. This is material world. And in the material world, whatever form we may have, we have got attachment for this body. Not only attachment, we are under the impression that I am this body, everyone. That is material conception of life. So that thing happened to Arjuna in the battlefield. He identified himself as the body. He thought himself that he belongs to the Kuru family, and his family relatives, his other side, his brother, nephews, or his grandfather. So he refused to fight. My dear Kṛṣṇa, after placing the chariot between the two parties, senaya rubhayor madhye rata-sthāpaya meyocchuta, and then he became very much disturbed. He thought, I have to kill. The other side, my brother and my nephews, my grandfather. No, no. Kṛṣṇa, I cannot. This is not possible. I shall not fight.

**Key Quote:** "Anyone who is identifying himself with this material body, he is animal, go-kharā."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that identifying oneself with the material body is animalistic and discusses how family affection drives economic development.

That is animal life. In the śāstra it is said, anyone who is identifying himself with this material body, he is animal, go-kharā. Go-kharā. Sa eva go-kharam. Go means cow, and kharo means ass. Yaśyātma-buddhi-kunapeti-dhātoke sadhik-kalatra-disubhau maiyyadhi Ya tīrtha-buddhi-salilena karhiśe janesu abhignesu sa eva go-kharam Yaśyātma-buddhi-kunapeti-dhātoke sadhik-kalatra-disubhau maiyyadhi Anyone who is identifying himself with this body, which is made of tri-dhātu. According to Ayurvedic medical system, this body is production of kapha-pitta-vāyu. Or in our modern medical science, anatomy, physiology, this body is a combination of bones, muscles, skin, blood, urine, stool, that's all. So śāstra says, if anyone thinks that he is this lump of bones, flesh, blood, urine and stool, yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇapetri-dhātu, and śadhiḥ kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, and the production of these bones and flesh, kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, because we have got relationship here in this material world with wife, kalatrā means wife, kalatrā, kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, beginning from wife. Wife produces so many children, therefore adiḥ, the beginning is wife. So śadhiḥ kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ. Kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, the wife and my children, they are mine. Kīt and kin, śadhiḥ kalatrā, śadhiḥ, they are my own.

**Key Quote:** "So Arjuna played the part of a gokhar."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues to describe the material attachments and explains that Arjuna played the part of someone identifying with the body, thus needing instruction.

Everyone is working. Even a great economist, Mr. Marshall, he says that economic development begins from family affection. So unless one thinks that he has to maintain his wife, children, family, there is no question of economic development, impetus. So yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇapetri-dhātuke śadhiḥ kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, and bhoma yadhiḥ, bhoma, this earth, as worshipping. Bhoma yadhiḥ, yat tīrtha-buddhiḥ śalile, and for pilgrimage, the one who thinks that the water is tīrtha. Tīrtha means where one can get transcendental knowledge. Śadhiḥ kalatrādiḥ śūraḥ, bhoma yadhiḥ, yat tīrtha-buddhiḥ śalile, na kariśe janeṣu abhijñeṣu, but has no interest to associate with persons who is expert in transcendental knowledge. Such these persons, they are called gokharas. Gokhara means cows and asses. So Arjuna played the part of a gokhar. In the battlefield of Kuruksetra, he played the part. He played the part of an ordinary person, gokharo, who is identifying this body as self. Therefore he required instruction. Not only he becomes so much overwhelmed that he gave up his arrows and bows and sat down tightly. My dear Kṛṣṇa, I am not, I cannot fight. And he was crying. Not only he gave up his duty, he was kṣatriya, and he was crying. Oh, I will have to kill my kinsmen. No, no, no, I cannot kill. So this is the setup in the first chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes presenting the Bhagavad-gita as it is, without misinterpretations, and asserts that the Mahabharata is a historical account of greater India.

arrangement in the battlefield, and then he's speaking. Now, sometimes Bhagavad-gītā is misinterpreted that these battle, I mean to say, dharma-kṣetre, kurukṣetre, or means this body. We do not misinterpret in that way. There is no question of misinterpretation. We are presenting Bhagavad-gītā as it is. We do not change by our whimsical imagination, concoction. We do not interpret the words of the Bhagavad-gītā according to our own desire. No. Actually, from literary point of view, interpretation is required when things are not understood very clearly. Then interpretation required. In the dog-hope, when the lawyers try to interpret before the judge, when the terms are not very clear. That is the same way in, among the associations, society of learned scholars. Interpretation is not required when the things are very clear. Just like the sunshine, sunlight. There is no need of a lamp to show the sun. The sun is self-reflection. It is already there. Light is there. Why one should take a lamp to show the sun? This misinterpretation has killed the spirit, the real essence of Bhagavad-gītā. So there are so many additions and so many misinterpretations. Our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, our proposition is that we are, I mean to say, presenting Bhagavad-gītā as it is. We do not misinterpret. So dharma-kṣetra, kuru-kṣetra. Kuru-kṣetra is dharma-kṣetra, the place where religious, ritualistic performances are done. So kuru-kṣetra, dharma-mācare, that is the Vedic version. So kuru-kṣetra is always, still people go for pilgrimage in kuru-kṣetra, and the station is there, kuru-kṣetra, and the place is there. People go there, kuru-kṣetra. Why one should interpret that kuru-kṣetra means this body, and Pāṇḍava means this pañca, indriya, so many? There is no question of interpretation. And this Mahābhārata, Mahābhārata means the history of greater India. That is Mahābhārata, history. It is history. It is not a fiction. It is history.

Mahābhārata. This planet was formerly known as Bhārata-varṣa. This is Mahābhārata. This planet, the whole planet, not that the piece of land, as we are calling now Bhārata-varṣa, no. Before that, this planet was known as Ilābhati-varṣa. And after the reign of Mahārāja Bharata, the son of Viśavadeva, this planet became Bhārata-varṣa. So Bhārata-varṣa means the whole planet. But we have laws. Just like we have lost a portion of the present Bhārata-varṣa as Pakistan. Everyone knows. Twenty years before, there was no such thing as Pakistan. But circumstantially, we have lost. So the whole Bhārata-varṣa has been partitioned as this portion is called America, this portion is called Europe, this portion is called... This is called Asia. These are modern names. Actually, the whole planet was Bhārata-varṣa, and the whole planet was being controlled by Vedic culture. So as we have lost our Vedic culture, as we could not control the others, other people in other part of the world, by our culture, by our political manual,

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains Dhritarashtra's anxiety and his desire for his sons to win the Kurukshetra battle, fearing a compromise.

then, what happened next? Dhrtarāṣṭhava was very much anxious. He said, dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre sama-vītā yuduṣyavaḥ. Now these two parties, yuduṣyavaḥ, both of them were desirous of fighting, yuduṣyavaḥ. So one party is māmaka, my sons, and the other party is Pāṇḍava. These two parties were desirous of fighting. So one party is māmaka, my sons, and the other party is Pāṇḍava. These two parties were desirous of fighting. So one party is māmaka, my sons, and the other party is Pāṇḍava, the sons of my brother, Pāṇḍava. Māmakā Pāṇḍavāśyaiva. Now the word is used, yuduṣyavaḥ. They assembled for fighting. Then what is the use of asking? King Akurvata. Then what did they do? It is natural to conclude that when they assemble for fighting, there must be fighting. But why he was asking King Akurvata? The suspect was that because the parties assembled in the dharma-kṣetra, so they might have changed their ideas. Still in India, if there is two fighting parties, they go to a temple and ask that, You say the right thing. So in the temple, still in the villages, they do not dare to say, dare to speak lies. Yes, they are fighting, and the misunderstanding has become settled up. So Dhrtarāṣṭhā was thinking whether the two parties, they have settled up. He did not like that. He wanted that these Pāṇḍavas should be killed, and my sons, Kauravas, they should come out victorious, so that there will be no enemy. He was very much anxious to place his sons on the throne. Because he was blind, he could not acquire the throne. His younger brother was situated on the throne. Now, after the death of his younger brother, he thought that I missed the opportunity of sitting on the throne. Why not my sons? They have got... That is actually right. That is the background of this Kuruksetra battle. He was always devising some means, how the sons of Pāṇḍu, his nephews, could be separated, and his sons would sit on the throne. That was his idea. Therefore he inquired, King Akhūrvata. Otherwise there is no question of inquiring King Akhūrvata.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the effect of the dharmakṣetra (holy place) was visible in Arjuna because he was a devotee, leading to his compassion and reluctance to fight.

So they went there to fight. They would fight there. But he was suspecting, if they have made any compromise, that he did not like, that he did not like. Therefore he asked, he wanted that there must be fight. And there are five brothers. My sons are one hundred in number. So they would be killed, and my sons will be without any rivalry. This is the background of Kuruksetra. Another thing, the dharmakṣetra, effect of dharmakṣetra, was visible in Arjuna. Dharmakṣetra. He, because he is devotee of Kṛṣṇa, yasyāsthi bhakti bhagavati akañcanaḥ sarvai guṇaitatra samāsati siddhā. Because he is devotee of Kṛṣṇa, therefore he felt, oh, what is this? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? Why is there a fight? I killed this, my brothers. Because he was devotee. This sentiment came into the mind of Arjuna, not on the other side, Duryodhana. He never thought. Although they were placed, both of them placed at dharmakṣetra, the effect of dharmakṣetra was manifest in the body of Arjuna, not Duryodhana.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada describes the devotee's compassion for others' suffering and contrasts it with the envy prevalent in the material world.

Devotees, they are para-duḥkha-duḥkhi. The symptom of a devotee is they are unhappy by seeing others unhappy. That is the symptom of devotee. Generally, person, if he sees somebody happy, he becomes unhappy, matsarata. That is the world situation. If I see my brother, he is very happy. He has improved in his material condition. Then I become unhappy. He has advanced so much, and I could not do so. This is material situation. Materials are envious, griha-medhi. Everyone is envious. Either you take person to person or neighbor to neighbor, their sympathy is lip-sympathy. Actually, everyone is envious. Businessman to businessman, nation to nation, this is material world. Therefore spiritual advancement means for person who is not envious, not envious. Parama nirma-sarāṁ satāṁ vāstyava-vaṣṭu-vedyaṁ. In the Sema-bhāgavatam it is said that if you want to know the real truth, vāstyava-vaṣṭu, then one must become parama nirma-sarāṁ, nirma-sarāṁ.

So cheating type of religious system are kicked out from this book, Sema-bhāgavatam. But it is meant for persons who are not envious. Parama nirma-sarāṁ satāṁ. Vāstava-bhāstu, one who wants to learn real reality, not false reality. Here in this material world, everything is false reality. Just like we are trying to find our water in the desert. That is the example, my race. False, there is no water. But the animal, he sees that there is water, fast water, and he runs after it and dies. So here in this material also world, every one of us running after the false mirage. There is happiness, there is happiness, there is happiness. This is called material condition. And we are envious. Yes, this is the position. And therefore Kṛṣṇa begins the Bhagavad-gītā, to get out of this ignorance and enviousness.

#### Bhakti-rasa-amrita-sindhu, Ocean of spiritual bliss, Material vs. Spiritual

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, this ocean is increasing."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the Nectar of Devotion as an ocean of spiritual bliss, contrasting it with the limited nature of material enjoyment.

Today we have a class by Sthivayangreshwara Prabhupada on Nectar of Devotion. It's divided into four parts, just as the ocean is sometimes divided into four parts. And there are different sections within each of these four divisions. Originally, in Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, the ocean is divided like the watery ocean, to east, west, north and south, while the subsections within these different divisions are called waves. As in the ocean, there are always different waves, either on the eastern side, the western side, the northern side or the southern side. Most similarly, Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu… That Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, the Sanskrit word, we have shortcut the translation, Nectar of Devotion, but Rupa Gosvami's purpose is to present the ocean of Bhakti Rasamrita. Rasamrita means mellow, the juice. It is like an ocean. This ocean has limitation, but that is unlimited. Ānandā-buddhi-vardhanam.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual bliss is different. That is simply increasing."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the difference between limited material enjoyment and the unlimited, ever-increasing nature of spiritual bliss experienced by yogis.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, this ocean is increasing. Now, this material… This material ocean, it has got limit. It cannot increase unlimitedly. That is not possible. Otherwise, how we could build? This house is on the beach. No. It is ordered not to come forward beyond this line. But the spiritual bliss, that ocean, is increasing. Ānandā-buddhi-vardhanam. That is the difference between spiritual bliss and material enjoyment. Material enjoyment is limited. You cannot enjoy unlimitedly. That is not possible. Just for few seconds, for few minutes, or for few hours, then it becomes disgusting. That is the material enjoyment. Okay? Spiritual enjoyment. Spiritual bliss is different. That is simply increasing. So, therefore, in the śāstras it is said, Those who are yogis, bhakta-yogīs, they enjoy unlimitedly. Unlimited. Unlimited. Yama, anantè, yogīna ánante. And that is satya-ânande. That ānanda bliss is real bliss.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the eternal and factual nature of the love between Krishna and Radha, and Krishna's relationships with other devotees, highlighting the eternal nature of spiritual relationships.

This is artificial. This is McMurtry reflection. I have several times explained that the love affairs between Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī, that is fact. There is no end. It all ends. They are enjoying. Rādhārāṇī… TV is cut off. Rādhārāṇī TV is cut off city inside. Telegraph. It is not found to be a drawback, and he is enjoying the company of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is enjoying. Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-pranaya-vikṣitī-allādini-śakti. That is Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency. As Kṛṣṇa is eternal, Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency is also eternal. So real love, Rādhā-kṛṣṇa, or Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs, or Kṛṣṇa and the cowherd boys, Kṛṣṇa and Yaśodāma, Nanda Mahārāja, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's servants, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's trees, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's water, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's flower, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's cow, everything eternal. That is eternal.

**Summary:** This segment discusses Krishna's expansions and the unlimited blissful enjoyment derived from devotional service, contrasting the enthusiasm of spiritual work with the fatigue of material labor.

ānanya-cinvaya-rasa-pradibhāvitābhi stābhir ya yeva-nija-rūpa-tayākalābhi Kṛṣṇa's enjoyment. It means Kṛṣṇa's expansion. Just like in Bhāgavata, you know, when Kṛṣṇa's cowherd boys, calves and cows were stolen by Brahmā, Kṛṣṇa again expanded Himself in the similar forms, so that the mother of the cowherd boys, the mother of the calves, they may not feel there is separation. Kṛṣṇa immediately replaced. That is Kṛṣṇa. So the blissful enjoyment with Kṛṣṇa, it is unlimited. That is called bhakti-rasa-amṛta-sindhu. Rasa and amṛta. Amṛta, that is not dying. That is not possible. Formation of material enjoyment. It is not possible. But because we are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is still a persistence. Yes. This is the difference. You will feel more and more enthusiasm. In material world, the more you work, you feel tired. And the spiritual world, the more you work, you will feel enthused. That is called ānandāmbudhi-vaddhanam. That is the test. If our workers are feeling tired, then that means he is working material. And if he is feeling enthused more and more, that is, he is working spiritually.

That is called ānandāmbudhi-vaddhanam. That is the spiritual test. Vara-mante yogina anante satyānande cidātmane. That is cidātmane. That is spiritual, not material. So here we are trying to enjoy materially. So how we can be happy? That is not possible. Materially we cannot be happy. Therefore Bhagavad-gītā gives us indication, sukhaṁ ātyantikam yat tat atindriyat grāhyam. If we want happiness, happiness is our priority, every individual soul, happiness. Because Kṛṣṇa is sac-cit-ānanda-vigrahaḥ, eternal, blissful ānanda, ānanda-blissful, citta, knowledge, and sac-icārya. That is Kṛṣṇa. Sac-cit-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.

**Summary:** This segment addresses the misconceptions of Mayavadi philosophers regarding Krishna's form, emphasizing the importance of understanding Krishna's chit-potency.

Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇa sac-cit-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. Vigrahaḥ means four, but not this four. Those who have no knowledge about Kṛṣṇa, they are thinking Kṛṣṇa is māyā. These bhaktas, they are worshiping the māyā form. Their philosophy is when Kṛṣṇa comes, when God comes, He takes a material form. No, that's not true. Kṛṣṇa said, sambhavāmi ātma-māyayāṁ, sambhavāmi ātma-māyayāṁ, the ātma-māyayāṁ means chit-potency. These Māyāvādī philosophers, they have no information that chit-potency. That is Allādhina-śakti. That is Rādhā-nāyā. They have got experience of this material potency, external energy, durgā. But they have no information of the chit-potency.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Killing this body does not mean killing yourself."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the nature of the material body and the consequences of suicide, explaining that killing the body does not end suffering.

Therefore they think that Kṛṣṇa appears in the form of māyā. Just like we have got this body, material body, this is gift by the māyā. Prakṛteḥ kriyamānāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarva-śaḥ. Ahamkāra-vimūrātmā-kartāḥ miti-manyate. Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ aśyaḥ sada-sada janma-yotiṣaḥ. Kāraṇa. We are getting this body according to our association with the different modes of material nature. But Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do with this material nature. Material nature is controlled by Him, and we are controlled by the material nature. That is the difference. He is controller, and we are controlled. They do not understand. They think that if I make null and void these conditions of controlling, then I become uncontrolled. That's like the philosophy, voidism. Or suicideism. I am feeling some pain in my body. If I think that let me commit suicide, then the pain will go away automatically. That is void philosophy. They're killing oneself, ātmahā, but because they have no understanding that killing this body does not mean killing yourself.

#### Suicide, Ghostly Body, Subtle Sciences, Sraddha Ceremony

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "Killing this body does not mean killing yourself."
**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on suicide, explaining the concept of the ghostly body and the purpose of the sraddha ceremony.

That is the philosophy. That is their ignorance. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is clearly said, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre. So these rascals think that if I commit suicide and just have a knife on my throat, then all my pains and pleasure are finished. No. That is not. You will be put into more pain and pleasure. Sometimes we'll have to accept. Why accept? It is certain. The ghosli body. Because Kṛṣṇa has given it, or māyā has given. Māyā has given, under the direction of Kṛṣṇa, a certain type of body for enjoying for a certain span of life. You cannot finish it. If you disregard it, then if you commit suicide, the result will be that you'll not be allowed to accept another material body. You'll have to remain in the subtle body. That is ghosṭi. Ghosṭi life means one who has misused this life, this body, and by his whim he has killed this body. He becomes ghosṭi. That means he'll have to suffer for so many days. Then he'll get another material body. Therefore there is śraddha-ceremonia. This śraddha-ceremonia means supposing my father or my relative has not got yet again gross body, this śraddha-ceremonia will help him to get another gross body. Because without this gross body, the ghosṭi body is very troublesome because he wants to enjoy something, but he has no instrument to enjoy. Therefore he creates, the ghosṭi creates trouble, sometimes captures somebody to fulfill his desires, and the man becomes ghosṭi, haunted. There are so many subtle sciences. What do they know, these so-called scientists?

**Summary:** This segment criticizes blind leaders and the pursuit of material enjoyment, emphasizing that true enjoyment comes from the spirit soul.

They're simply falsely proud, taking account of the small duration of life for ten to twenty years, fifty years, or at most a decade. That's all. They do not know. Andāya-dhān dhairupaniya mānāḥ. And still they're becoming kaita, they're becoming sāmīs, they're becoming gurus, they're becoming fathers, they're becoming government. How people can be happy? Everyone is anda, blind. They have no gain, no knowledge, and misleading, always. Yes. So the ānanda-āmbudhi-vardhaṁ. You can have unlimited ānanda, but because you are falsely trying to enjoy through this material body, therefore you are becoming confused and frustrated. That they do not know. They think, I have got this material body. I have got some senses. Let me enjoy these senses to the best possibility. But you cannot do it, because it is false. It is not real. Real senses, unless you feel sensation, that sensation, consciousness, is there because the spirit soul is there. Otherwise there is no sensation. And unless you feel sensation, there is no enjoyment. So this bodily enjoyment is false. Real enjoyment of the spirit.

Therefore it is said, ramante yoginā anante. They want to enjoy life with ananta, Kṛṣṇa. They want to become friend of Kṛṣṇa. They want to become lover of Kṛṣṇa. They want to become servant of Kṛṣṇa. They want to become father of Kṛṣṇa. They want to become mother of Kṛṣṇa. The same thing, as we are pervertedly enjoying in this material, the same thing is there, spiritual life. That is Kṛṣṇa exhibiting. When He appears on this earth, He practically shows how He can enjoy also with Him. That is Vṛndāvana living. Practical manifestation. But we are not taking to that. We are taking this Vṛndāvana lila of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is māyā. Vṛndāvana is lāyā. Now simply press your nose and think of something impersonal. That is for living. No? That is not. This is fact. Ramante, unless you are many varieties, there cannot be enjoyment. Ramante, yoginā anante. Ramante, this very word, one who is engaged, he is called, iti rāma-pade nāso para-brahma-hitya-vidhiya.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the nature of the spiritual soul and the contrast between spiritual and material existence, criticizing the Mayavadi philosophers' understanding of Krishna.

This is the meaning of Rāma, Rāma, Kṛṣṇa, Rādhā-Ramana, Rādhā-Mālā. So this science has to be understood. We are, everyone is after happiness. Ānanda-mayabhyāsā. We are spiritual soul, spiritual spark. Our life is ānanda, sac-cid-ānanda, eternal life, blissful life, life of knowledge. But we are put into this material condition, which is ignorance, miserable, and temporary. Just opposite. Instead of having eternal, blissful, knowledgeable life, we have got this body, which is non-eternal, non-permanent, and always miserable, in condition, and not blissful. Always miserable, and we are always in ignorance. That's the opposite. So Kṛṣṇa is not like this. If we think of Kṛṣṇa like that, then it is a mistake. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they are thinking of Kṛṣṇa like that, that Kṛṣṇa is like me. Abha-jānanti māṁ mūḍhaḥ. They are rascals, mūḍhaḥ. They are thinking there is something above Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they are mūḍhās. Abha-jānanti māṁ mūḍhaḥ. Because they have no knowledge. Parambhāva-bhajānanta. They do not know the parambhāva, the bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.

**Summary:** This segment explains the purpose of the Krishna consciousness movement in providing real knowledge about Krishna and refutes the idea of an impersonal God.

They have no idea. They have no knowledge. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore giving them the real knowledge. Kṛṣṇa, how He is enjoying. He is, how He is joyful. Ānanda-cinemaya. Ānanda-cinemaya-rasa-putibhāhu tāpi. Āṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciram jaganti. Ānanda-cinemaya sad ujjala-vigrahasya. Ānanda-sat ujjala-vigraha. It's not ordinary vigraha like this. They have got bitter experience of this vigraha, of this form. Therefore they want to make God impersonal. Must be opposite. They have got this bitter knowledge that getting this body, we are suffering so much. Therefore the God must be without body. Just opposite. This is also material thinking. Thinking in a negative way. But they have no knowledge. There is a God as body, but that is completely spiritual. It has nothing to do with the material body. They cannot think of spiritual body.

So the Bhakti-raha-sāmṛta-sindhu is teaching people how you can enjoy in the ocean of blissfulness. That is Bhakti-raha-sāmṛta. So Rupa Gosvāmī is dividing. Just like the sea has got east, west, north, south, similarly he is dividing the ocean of nectaring in four divisions. And as there are waves in the ocean, so there are different chapters. That means he is dividing the Bhakti-raha-sāmṛta book in four parts.

Then the material platform, you are going, working, you will feel tired, and you will try to retire from it.

As you prolong, execute devotional service, bhagavata-bhakti-yoga, prasannam anaso, you become jolly, because that is your nature. At the present moment, although I am spirit soul, my nature is to become jolly, ānanda, but because I am covered by this material nature, my joyfulness has practically disappeared. I am here. Or I am trying to enjoy life through this material body. That is my position. So if you engage yourself in devotional service, the first engagement is the śravaṇa, hearing. It is not difficult. You don't have to go anywhere. Śrīmatān sakataḥ kṛṣṇaḥ. Kṛṣṇa is within you. If you kindly hear about Kṛṣṇa, that is the first business, śravaṇa.

**Summary:** This segment explains that even if literature describing Krishna has grammatical errors, it is still valuable if it glorifies the Supreme Lord.

Those who are sādhu, those who are devotees, they hear that literature. They hear that literature. Otherwise, another, the next verse, I forget now, that vāyaśatīrthaṁ. That it is being described as vāyaśatīrthaṁ, uśanti mānasā. So this kind of literature, even it is not properly grammatically correct. tad-vāga-viśabhakaḥ janatāṁ viplaṭhaḥ yasmīṁ pratiḥ ślokam avadhyaḥ That, in writing Sanskrit slow, it requires very high education. It is not like, whatever I write, three lines, one line, and two lines, not. There is some metric system, caṇḍa. So śaita, śukadeva Gosvāmī says, even it is not properly composed, but because there is anantasya, anantasya guṇāne, the glorification of ananta, the Supreme, śrīṇanti gāyanti gṛṇanti sādhavaḥ, those who are sādhus, actually, they accept it. It doesn't matter if there is little grammatical mistake or some poetical discrepancies. There are literary rules and regulations. So śāstra says it doesn't matter even there is not perfectly. Śaṅkarāyāsā also says, nāhi nāhir aṣṭhati duḥkīṁ karaḥ . You cannot be saved by simply grammatical efficiency. The grammatical efficiency is secondary.

Just like milk touched by the lips of a serpent is poison. You cannot say, it is milk, very nice. No. Because it is touched by the lips of the serpent, it is useless. Similarly, as soon as a professional reciter or a avaiṣṇava reciter, without any realization, without being a devotee of the Lord, cites, recites, that should not be heard. That is restricted by śrīnātana-guṣa. avaiṣṇava mukha-gīrṇā-pūta-harī-kathā-mṛtaṁ śravaṇaṁ na kaśvatam. Because you will not derive any benefit. You go on hearing for thousands of years, thousands of years. You still will remain where you are in the beginning. But śrīnātana-guṣa-kṣiṣṭo pāyo yathā. But śrīnātana-guṣa-kṣiṣṭo pāyo yathā. But śrīnātana-guṣa-kṣiṣṭo pāyo yathā.

**Summary:** This segment discusses how one can conquer Krishna by remaining in their position and hearing from the proper source, using the example of Yasoda Maharaja.

You will understand. So it requires little willingness. sthāne sthitā śrutigatāṁ tanavāṁ na nobhīḥ . prāśo ajitopi jitaḥ paśi ta istila kyaṁ. This statement was given by Brahmā, and when it was quoted by Rāmānanda Rāya before Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he accepted that sthāne sthitā śrutigatāṁ tanavāṁ na nobhīḥ . You can remain your position. You don't require to change your position. Not that you have to give up your household life, you have to accept sannyāsa, or you have to do this, the other. No. Remain in your position. But try to hear from the proper source and try to understand. That will make you so strong that Kṛṣṇa is ajitaḥ, unconquerable, but you'll conquer Him. You'll conquer Him. Ajitopi, jitaḥ paśi, he becomes conquered. Because Kṛṣṇa cannot be conquered by anyone, by the demons, but He can be conquered by a devotee. Just like Yaśodā Mahārāja, he has conquered Kṛṣṇa. The whole world is trembled by Kṛṣṇa's prowess, but Kṛṣṇa is trembling before Yaśodā Mahārāja.

**Summary:** This segment concludes by emphasizing that devotees can become the mother or father of Krishna, highlighting Krishna's desire to be controlled by His devotees and the essence of Krishna's life in Vrindavana.

On the stick. So he wants to be controlled. Because everyone is praying. My dear Lord, oh, You are so great. Everyone prays like that. But no one shows his stick. But he wants, because that is also enjoyment. So sometimes he is disappointed that nobody wants me to show his stick. Therefore he finds out there is such a devotee who can show him stick. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. So you can become mother of Kṛṣṇa, you can become father of Kṛṣṇa. What is to become one with Kṛṣṇa? You become father of Kṛṣṇa. The Māyāvādīs, they want to march into the Supreme. But we want to become father of Kṛṣṇa. Why march? More than Kṛṣṇa. The devotee can beget Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa accepts that. Yes, I shall become your child. I shall be controlled by your stick. So they are, they are not ordinary. We should not think like that. That is ānanda-cinmaye rasa-pradibhā. That is Kṛṣṇa's expansion of pleasure potency. Kṛṣṇa wants to be controlled by Yaśodā Mahārāja. Kṛṣṇa wants to be defeated by His friends. Kṛṣṇa wants to be refused. Rādhārāṇī is darsana. Yes. Rādhārāṇī is angry. She has refused. He has ordered. They are so guilty. Don't allow Kṛṣṇa to come here. Yes. Kṛṣṇa is flattering, kindly let me go. No, sorry, cannot go. This is Kṛṣṇa, you see. But at the same time, gopī-jana-vallava. Yayasi rādhā mādhava gopī-jana-vallava. Kṛṣṇa is, that is Kṛṣṇa's actual life. He is gopī-jana-vallava. He is rādhā mādhava. He is Giri-varadhāra. As soon as the gopīs and the cowards march in distress, He'll uplift this hill, govardhana, Giri-varadhā. That is Kṛṣṇa's life. As the gopīs and the cowards march, and the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they have sacrificed everything, they do not know anything but Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa also does not know anything beyond Vṛndāvana. That is Kṛṣṇa. That is bhakti-tasvāmṛta-sindhu.

Just like Kṛṣṇa Himself is expanding Himself as gopas, as cowherds, boys, as cubs and cows and trees in Vṛndāvana, आनंद्र चिन्मय रस अप्रतिभाविताबिता जयोगी। They are all आनंद्र चिन्मय रस.

**Key Quote:** "To understand कृष्णा is not very easy thing, मनुषानाम सहास्तेशु."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the difficulty in understanding Krishna, highlighting Krishna's kindness in providing instructions through the Bhagavad Gita and emphasizing the importance of understanding Krishna through the paramparā (disciplic succession).

So we have to realize these things, what is कृष्णा, that मनुषानाम सहास्तेशु कच्चि जतति सिद्धाम, जतताम भी सिद्धानाम कच्चि वित्ति मांततु. To understand Kṛṣṇa is not very easy thing, मनुषानाम सहास्तेशु. Out of many, many millions who are trying to become successful in the mission of life, मनुषानाम सहास्तेशु कच्चि जतति सिद्धाये, सिद्धाये, सिद्धाये means to become, सिद्धा, means to become ब्रह्म भूत, to understand that I am not this material body, I am ब्रह्मास्तेशु, that is सिद्धि. And जतताम भी सिद्धानाम कच्चि वित्ति मांततु. So out of many शास्तेशु, सिद्धास्तेशु, we have realized पर्मात्मा or ब्रह्मा, out of many such millions of people, one can understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is so difficult subject matter. But he is so kind also that he is giving us instruction personally in the form of भगवत गीता, what he is, what he is. He says, मत्तः परतरः नान्या किंचि जस्ति धनन्या। My dear Arjuna, don't labor hard simply that there is something beyond me. Sometimes they say that there is still more beyond कृष्णा, but कृष्णा says, no, there is nothing beyond, मत्तः परतरः नान्या किंचि जस्ति धनन्या। शुत्रे गणायिव, everything is resting on me. अहं सर्वश्य प्रभुगत। The Vedanta says, जन्मा दस्य जताँ। जन्मा स्थिते लौज। Where it is staying, where it is being conducted, that is Brahman. Kṛṣṇa answers this question that अहं सर्वश्य प्रभुगत। He is deceiving Brahman. Therefore Arjuna accepted him. परंब्रम्म परंधम्। We are Brahmas, but we are not परंब्रम्म। परंब्रम्म is Kṛṣṇa. We are आत्मा, but we are not परंब्रम्मात्मा। परंब्रम्मात्मा is Kṛṣṇa. So in this way, मनुष्चा नाम सहर्षेशु कष्चि जतति सिद्धये जततामपि सिद्ध्यान। कष्चि वेत्ति माम। So in this way, we have to understand Kṛṣṇa. एमं परंप्राप्रात्म एमं राजर्षय विदु। We have to understand Kṛṣṇa through the paramparā disciple succession, not by our ABCD knowledge.

#### guru, disciple succession, representative of Krishna, respect for guru

**Key Quote:** "We have to understand Kṛṣṇa through the paramparā disciple succession, not by our ABCD knowledge."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of accepting a bona fide spiritual master (guru) who is a representative of Krishna, highlighting the need to respect the guru as Krishna's representative without the guru considering himself Krishna.

That is not possible. One has to accept the disciple succession line. तद्विज्ञान अर्थम्सव गुरुमेव भिगच्छे। That guru, guru means Kṛṣṇa's representative. कृष्णा जय है। शाक्षा धरित्तेन समस्त शास्त्रयि रुप्तस्त तथा भाव्यत एवत सद्धित्यों। शाक्षा धरित्तेन, because guru is representative of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he should be respected as guru, as Kṛṣṇa. किन्तु प्रवोर्ज्य प्रिय एवत सद्धित्यों। But because a guru is respected as Kṛṣṇa, the guru does not think that he has become Kṛṣṇa. No. That is foolishness. He is the most confidential servant of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, just like most confidential secretary, he acts as the master. His signature, his settlement, he'll be accepted by the master. Similarly, yasya prasādād bhagavata-prasād. Yasya prasādād naga-tī-pṛto. We are to select the right representative of Kṛṣṇa and accept Him as guru. And if I please Him, then Kṛṣṇa will be pleased. There is no need of somebody, they say that Kṛṣṇa is not present, how shall I please Him? No. Kṛṣṇa's representative is present. You please Him. जस्व देवे पराभक्ति जथा देवे तथा गुरोगुरु। This is the process. जथा देवे तथा गुरुगुरु। तश्य इते कति ता जर्चा प्रकाश्म गुरुक्ति। This is the process. आदु गुर्भास्रम्। That is Gosvāmī, Rūpa Gosvāmī giving his, in the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-kṛṣṇa, आदु गुर्भास्रम्। If you are actually interested to understand Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa-bhakti, the first business is आदु गुर्भास्रम्। You take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master who is representative of Kṛṣṇa.

**Key Quote:** "If his representative says that he surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is representative."
**Summary:** This segment explains how to identify a representative of Krishna, emphasizing that the representative will advocate surrender to Krishna and promote Krishna consciousness, which is the real dharma.

And how we can understand the representative of Kṛṣṇa? And that is not very difficult, because what Kṛṣṇa says, if the representative says the same thing, then he is representative. It is not very difficult. कृष्ण सेज सर्वधन्माण पुरित्तज्य मामेकं सरणं भज्याँ। If his representative says that he surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is representative. He does not become himself Kṛṣṇa. That is bogus. A faithful servant will never say that आम ने मास्ता है। I am servant, although he is as good as the master. सिमिलली गुरु ई शक्षा धरित्ते पहनो समस्त शास्त्री उक्तस्तथाभाव्यसौ प्रभुर्जप्रिय एवतृ। He is the most confidential ruse. जो कृपया का शर्मान का विश्वाल रहता है कि वह भूल है। इसका जाना पाए। वह कृपया को कुछ नहीं पहले जाना पाता है किृष्णौ के लिए। प्राप्त का अक्षय प्रबेशन रहता है। गोपी भत्तु पदकमलो दाशो, दाशो, दाशानो दाशा ए गुरु ही जबंपणी या ज्रमण ये होता है हắn लेंưng वे कुछ ऩर्ली आप नहीं का जर्मण स्ट्रिल क्रम करते हैं भी कुछ  Collect. भाग αν आप सर्वेशन का सेक्स्यशन है, सर्वेशन की सर्वेशन और सर्वेशन की सर्वेशन होते पर कुराम प्रार्पंस होना। Backup प्रक्रर्पुतृ, तो आप वह डृपन्तप्राप्तंत होते होंगे, और खत्म की साहत का संधीर होने के लिए ने गुरु, कृष्णा, and the latest गुरु, कृष्णा, because the aim is the same. कृष्णा personally says शर्वधर्मान पुरित्त जम्मामिकं शरुणं भज़ाँ, and who is representative of कृष्णा, he will say the same thing. You surrender to कृष्णा. कृष्णा says मन्मना भवमत भक्त मत जाजि माग नमस्कुरू, the guru will say, yes, you become always कृष्णा conscious. मन्मना. कृष्णा says मन्मना. A guru says you become कृष्णा conscious. The same thing. There is no difference. You become devotee of कृष्णा. You always think of कृष्णा. You always chant of कृष्णा. You always speak of कृष्णा. You do not know anything but कृष्णा. Simply this life is required. So this कृष्णा consciousness movement is teaching people to become कृष्णा, कृष्णा conscious means कृष्णा says मन्मना भव मत भक्त मत जाजि माग नमस्कुरू, the four things. You just become always thinking of कृष्णा. You just become a devotee of कृष्णा. You just offer your obeisances unto कृष्णा and you just worship कृष्णा. And accept कृष्णा, giving up any other engagement. Because real धर्म is to surrender to कृष्णा. Otherwise why कृष्णा says सर्वधर्माल पुरितर्यु. Why he says give up all other so called धर्मास. They are not धर्मास. And the भागवात से धर्म प्रोज्जित कोईत वत्र.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that real dharma is surrendering to Krishna, promoting the Krishna consciousness movement as genuine and easy, especially in this age, and highlighting the power of chanting Hare Krishna to become free from material contamination and return to God.

The cheating type of धर्म is kicked out from this भागवात. Cheating type. Real धर्म, what is that? Real धर्म. धर्मं तुषाप्षाद भगवत्र नेख़ाँ. What भागवान says सर्वधर्माल पुरितर्यु मामे कमुष्णा. This is real धर्म. So we request everyone. It is very scientific. It is authorized. We are not talking nonsense. Authorized. We are taking the version of कृष्णा. We are taking the version of the वेदि कंक्रूशन्त्. वेदा इष्ट शर्वई अहमेव वेद्या. वेदा, study of वेदा means to understand कृष्णा. One who does not understand कृष्णा, he is simply wasting his time. धर्म शनु स्थितप्पंश विश्यक्षेण कथासु जत। नुत्पादय दृतिं जदि स्रमय वहिके। You can execute your धर्म, your occupational duty, very nicely. That's all right. But if you do not develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you are simply wasting your time and working hard for nothing. This is the part. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very genuine and it is very easy, especially in this age. That is also authorized statement of Śrūadeva Gosvāmī. कीतनादेव कृष्णस्य मुख्यसंग पढ़ंबजेत। He has described, because in this age, in this age it is called कलीजूप। There are so many impediments. People are fallen. मन्दाश मन्द मतयु मन्द भाग्या जुपद्रता। They are disturbed. So many botheration. It is very difficult to realize Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But there is very shortcut way recommended. कीतनादेव कृष्णस्य मुख्यसंग पढ़ंबजेत। Simply by chanting हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे। हरे नाम हरे नाम राम राम हरे हरे। You become uncontaminated of this material contamination. And thus being free from material contamination, you become eligible to go back to home, back to God.

### Srila Gaura Kishora Dasa Babaji | Special Discourse on Disappearance Day

**Key Quote:** "After the demise of his wife Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj left the country, left his business and went to Vrindavan."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada narrates the early life and renunciation of Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, including his time in Vrindavan and Navadvipa Dham.

Today is the most auspicious disappearance day anniversary of one of the previous acharyas in our Sampradaya, His Divine Grace Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. So, a brief biography of Srila Gaur Kishodas, let us hear, and by his blessings, we will be able to advance in our Krishna consciousness by trying to follow some of the instructions that he has very nicely given us. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj appeared sometime in the 1830s in the village of Vagyana in East Bengal, or Vagyana in East Bengal, which is what is now known as Bangladesh. During his boyhood, his mother and father arranged a marriage for him, and he remained in household affairs for more than 20 years. While a householder, he worked as a broker in the grain business, but even at that time, he exhibited his spirituality. After the demise of his wife, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj left the country, left his business, and went to Vrindavan. There he approached Srila Bhagavad Das Babaji, one of the foremost disciples of Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj, and accepted from Bhagavad Das Babaji Maharaj the traditional Paramahamsa Vaishnava Babaji dress. After this, he became completely renounced and would stay under trees in various parts of the forest of the 168 mile Vraja Mandala or Vrindavan area. He continuously acted thus for a period of approximately 30 years. During this time, he would sometimes travel to the holy places of pilgrimage in northern and western India. Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj became very famous among the great devotees of Vrindavan and was awarded the appropriate title of Bhajananandi. Bhajananandi means one who is dedicated to remain in one place and chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord and completely absorb themselves in the chanting and hearing of the holy name of the Supreme Lord, but we should not try to imitate such great devotees; rather, we should accept the instructions of our spiritual master and try to follow those instructions in our practical life while hearing the great qualities of our spiritual master and the previous Acharyas and their great deeds of devotion and service dedicated entirely for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Even though he received such honor, he never endeavored for even a small bit of material sense gratification and totally disapproved of the secret material desires of pseudo-renunciants and so many people who try to imitate great devotees, and prematurely they try to renounce this world, but it is not very easy to maintain the standard of renunciation exhibited by such paramahamsas as Sri Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. He would perform his pure unalloyed devotional pastimes alone in a profound devotional mood. In the year 1897, during the month of Falgunna, when he was in his sixties, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj proceeded to Navadvipa Dham from Vrindavan Dham, and under the instruction, he did this under the instruction of Srila Jagannath Das Babaji Maharaj. From this time until his disappearance, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj remained in Navadvipa Dham and in different villages

**Key Quote:** "These are considered totally impure but a renunciant has nothing to do with purity and impurity of this world."
**Summary:** This segment describes Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's extreme renunciation and detachment from material possessions, highlighting his acceptance of things considered impure by others.

he was visiting the various places of pastimes of Lord Gauranga, and he was realizing the non-difference between Navadvipa Dham and Vrindavan Dham. He begged by gathering dry foodstuff from the householders of the holy Dham. He would sometimes offer these foodstuffs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by simply holding them in his hand. He was totally renounced, so he didn't have any elaborate arrangements for offering or cooking or anything like that. In order to cook, he would collect dry wood from the footpath, and he would wash earthen pots discarded by the villagers along the roadside near the Ganges River on the occasion of eclipses. These are considered totally impure, but a renunciant has nothing to do with purity and impurity of this world. Just he would take something of no value to others, and somehow with those bare minimum things, he would maintain himself. This would actually ensure that such great devotees are never entangled in any material endeavors. They save time, maximum amount of time, for their spiritual activities exclusively. In order to clothe himself, he would go to the shore of the Ganges and collect and wash discarded cloth that had been used to cover dead bodies at the burning heart. This was his level of renunciation. Thus, he always remained independent of the support of others simply by utilizing items of no value to others.

**Summary:** This segment explains Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's relationship with Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, clarifying their roles in the disciplic succession leading to Srila Prabhupada.

In such a manner, he obtained the practical necessities of life. In 1897, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur constructed his place of bhajana on the bank of the Saraswati River at Godurma Dvipa, one of the nine islands in Navadvipa, called Svananda Sukhada Kunja. This is the name Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur gave to that building he constructed. This was a gathering place for exalted souls, for great devotees. Here, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur recited and explained the Srimad Bhagavatam and other topics regarding the conclusion of devotional service, and Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj would come and hear these talks with great delight. In this way, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj accepted Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur as his shiksha guru. Also, Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj accepted Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur as his only disciple. That's how you see in our parampara, His divine grace, A.C. Bhaktivinoda Swami Prabhupada, the founder Acharya of ISKCON. His guru is Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. His guru is Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj, and His shiksha guru is Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur. This is the parampara in which Srila Prabhupada, the founder Acharya of ISKCON, is coming. So Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj is the spiritual master of the spiritual master

of Srila Prabhupada. His only possessions, if at all you may consider them as possessions, were the Tulsi beads he wore around his neck, this Kanti Mala, and the Tulsi Mala he kept in his hand for counting his rounds. His Kanti Mala and his Japa Mala were his only two possessions. He also kept a few books such as Narottam Das Thakur's Prarthana and Prema Bhakti Chandrika. These are two famous books, books written by Narottam Das Thakur, contains a collection of the songs he has composed explaining the pure devotional service. Even though it appeared that Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj was not a learned Sanskrit scholar, still the purport and conclusions of all scriptures were luminous in his heart and character. It is described in the scriptures that chanting of the holy name reveals all transcendental knowledge within the heart, and this is practically seen in the life of Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj. He knew all the conclusions of the scriptures without studying them separately. That is because his chanting was pure. We should not imitate this. It was never possible for anyone to serve him, for he was never willing to accept any kind of service from any person. He exhibited the highest standard of devotion to the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna, and because of his exemplary character, he was recognized as the personification of the deepest degree of separation from Lord Sri Krishna, Vipralamba Seva, service in separation from Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Whoever eats fish is like a prostitute. These are harsh words but then they are required to cut through the several layers of illusion that is clouding the consciousness of our condition so."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada narrates an incident where Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj refuses sweets offered by a lawyer, emphasizing the importance of purity and devotion in offerings to the Lord.

This is what is taught by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, especially in our Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya, because in separation from Krishna, one feels intense mood of service to Krishna, not as much as when one is in the presence of Krishna. It is more intense than in the presence of Krishna. In separation from Krishna, one is able to serve with more intensity Krishna, with that intense feeling of devotion towards Krishna. There are many incidents recorded by biographers about his preaching. Even though he is called a bhajananandi, he would not travel and actively preach, but anybody approached him for getting guidance, for getting some practical instructions, he was ever willing to give them his divine association. So I will just mention one or two such incidents which are very instructive for all of us. Once a lawyer by name Bhattacharya brought several sweets and prayerfully requested Srila Gautishwada's Babaji Maharaj to accept his offering. Srila Babaji Maharaj told him, "I never take any sweets." So then Bhattacharya replied, "There is nothing higher than accepting food that the Lord has directly accepted," indicating thereby that it is Prasadam. "Why are you refusing Prasadam?" So then Srila Babaji Maharaj, Gautishwada's Babaji Maharaj, sharply retorted, "Whoever eats fish is like a prostitute." These are harsh words, but then they are required to cut through the several layers of illusion that is clouding the consciousness of our condition. So if someone has perverted desires and offers foodstuffs to Lord Chaitanya, these preparations can never be accepted

as the Prasad of the Supreme Lord because the Lord does not partake of them. What does Krishna say in the Bhagavad Gita? Yome Bhaktya Prayacchati Patram Pushpam Phalam Toyam Yome Bhaktya Prayacchati. The important aspect of the offering, more than the item itself, is the devotion with which that offering is made. So Krishna, what does he want when we offer? He wants devotion. He wants Bhakti. So somebody is having lusty desires in his heart and then makes a show of offering, that is not accepted by Krishna. To offer foodstuffs to the Supreme Lord that have been contaminated by one's lusty desire should be considered a great offense. That means it is against our devotional interest. If one accepts the grains of a sinful person, then his mind becomes impure. This is very important for all of us that why do we say eat only Prasadam, don't eat food that is not offered to Krishna because we do not know sometimes the source of such food could be, if it is not properly offered to Krishna, then it could be from the sinful person, and then that contaminates our mind, so we should be very careful not to accept anything which is not Prasadam properly offered to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "When one eats food offered by a materialistic man, one's mind becomes contaminated and when the mind becomes contaminated one is unable to think of Krishna properly."
**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on purity, emphasizing the importance of avoiding food cooked by lustful persons and the contamination of the mind that results from it.

Thus one is directed by Babaji Maharaj not to accept food cooked by lustful persons, especially by those who know the actual standard of behavior expected of devotees of Sri Krishna, but who nevertheless indulge knowingly in illicit activities. So this is very, very important for us to remember, knowingly one should never indulge in sinful activities, at the same time perform devotional service, especially offering of food stuff to the Supreme Lord. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu instructed Srila Swaroop Damodar Goswami as follows: when one eats food offered by a materialistic man, one's mind becomes contaminated, and when the mind becomes contaminated, one is unable to think of Krishna properly. Contaminated mind is not conducive for any form of devotional service, our practice becomes obstructed. Srila Gaukishodas Babaji Maharaj always gave beneficial instructions to persons who approached him with faith and humility, no matter what their spiritual status might have been. On one such occasion, a seeker went to Babaji Maharaj to hear topics concerning the Supreme Lord, but he heard some harsh words from him instead. The seeker therefore resolved, sorry, the seeker therefore resolved never again to go near Babaji Maharaj because he was feeling hurt by the harsh words spoken by Gaukishodas Babaji Maharaj.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada narrates another incident where a seeker is corrected by Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj for avoiding the association of devotees due to harsh words.

after some time, however, when he was very much distressed in his mind, he decided to go and see Babaji Maharaj. So Srila Gaukishodas Babaji Maharaj could immediately understand the reason for the depression of this particular seeker, and he told him, "You have left the association of devotees where topics about Krishna are discussed, and now you are living in a secluded place performing solitary worship of Krishna. When one hears the topic of Supreme Lord in the company of devotees, then one becomes freed from Maya's net of illusion, but if someone performs worship of the Lord in a secluded place, not in the association of devotees, one becomes caught by the material illusory energy of the Lord. As a consequence, instead of topics about the Supreme Lord possessing the heart, mundane subject matters will occupy the heart." The seeker replied, "I thought it better to reside in a secluded place and perform my own individual worship than to become disturbed by hearing the sharp words of a sadhu." He thought, "If I remain with a sadhu and the sadhu speaks very harsh words, then my mind will always be disturbed. I can peacefully go to some other place and do my own worship and be nicely situated to do devotional service." So Babaji Maharaj replied, "Please take note that these sadhus who speak sharp words to drive away the witch of the illusory energy are actually the only real devotees of Krishna and friends of the living entities. When a devotee of the Lord who is always desirous of the living entity's ultimate welfare chastises him just once with instructions meant to drive away maya, then that living being immediately makes plans to leave the saintly persons for his entire life.

**Key Quote:** "Then you must accept the harsh language of the sadhu as the medicine by which maya can be given up."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the harsh words of a sadhu are like medicine, meant to cure one of illusion, and should be accepted for spiritual advancement.

if you actually want to perform devotional service properly, then you must accept the harsh language of the sadhu as the medicine by which maya can be given up. It's just like when a doctor prescribes a medicine, even if it is bitter, you take it because you know that only by taking the proper medicine, even if it is bitter, it will cure you of your ailment or disease. So you should not look for something that is tasting sweet when it comes to taking medicine. Similarly, the harsh words of a sadhu may sound very, very hurting, but actually they are meant simply to pull you out of illusion, which is the purpose of your doing devotional service. By this, one can obtain the necessary spiritual advancement to successfully chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord. Then another instance, one other person, he inquired from Srila Gaurakeshwara's Babaji Maharaj as follows. He said, "We see that there are many Vaishnavas living with their wives who perform devotional service to Lord Hari. Will they get any benefit from such service?" Srila Babaji Maharaj replied, "The living entity is the eternal servant of Lord Krishna, but when the conditioned soul looks upon his wife and son simply by seeing their material external forms, then one does not have the eye of devotion, and he can never perceive his real identity as the eternal servant of Krishna. The conditioned souls always have inclination to enjoy their wives and children, that's natural, and they don't like to hear so much the topics of the Supreme Lord or to get association of the Lord's devotees.

**Key Quote:** "The living entity is the eternal servant of lord Krishna, but when the conditioned soul looks upon his wife and son simply by seeing their material external forms then one does not have the eye of devotion."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the challenges of family life and devotional service, contrasting genuine Vaishnavas with those who exhibit 'monkey renunciation' (external detachment without inner purity).

if one does not attain the spiritual energy given by chanting the holy name, then one will become attracted by his wife and children. Then again, there are other persons who externally want to detach themselves from their wives and children and sense enjoyment, but they don't have any kind of external renunciation without actually having that detachment within the heart is like the renunciation of monkeys, markata vairagya, this is what it's called. And although they externally live away from their possessions, but their heart is dirty, the heart is not clean. So what is the characteristic of a monkey? A monkey lives naked, so it doesn't even have a piece of cloth, it doesn't have a proper house, it lives simply on the ground, it lives on the ground. So the monkey has the desire to enjoy so many female monkeys, not just one, every male monkey will have so many male monkeys as a devotee or an ancient should reflect the inner detachment or should at least aim it also simultaneously strenuously trying for detachment from within the heart. The genuine vaishnava will never maintain an attitude of sense gratification towards his wife and children, but he will always regard himself. Those actually desirous of performing Haribhajana, but in whose heart the weeds of material desires grow and were unable to give up excessive attachment of their wife and children, should always try to hear from pure devotees and chant Hare Krishna and perform congregational chanting. Instead of leaving their family and going away to a secluded place, one should actually engage in such activities even while remaining in family life. In this way, they can quickly become detached from the inclination to enjoy materially. Then they will gradually realize that if one completely surrenders to Krishna, then one will attain all the qualities of life. This is called auspiciousness. As long as one remains in bodily consciousness, one cannot obtain the mercy of Krishna.

**Summary:** This segment describes the events surrounding Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's passing away and the controversy that arose regarding the location of his samadhi due to material motives.

So in this way, Gaur Kishore das Babaji Maharaj taught what is real renunciation because he himself was a real renunciate. Then regarding his passing away, on November 16, 1915, Gaur Kishore das Babaji Maharaj entered the eternal pastimes of the Lord, Nitya Leela Pravishta. That means he passed away from this world. That day at sunrise, his disciple Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur left Sri Mayapur for the place where Srila Bhaktisiddhanta, sorry, Gaur Kishore das Babaji Maharaj had been staying in a place at Kuliyam. The head priest of Navadvipa's various temples and ashrams began to argue where would Babaji Maharaj's samadhi be made, the actual place. So there was a heated argument among so many different people. So because there was a material motive, whoever got the opportunity to prepare the samadhi of this great Paramahamsa, Srila Gaur Kishore das Babaji Maharaj, they would have huge number of people visit their temple and get handsomely from the pilgrims. So with this material motive, there was so much of argument. So Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur could understand their material motive, and he wanted to actually stop them from simply creating a controversy. Now, not only Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur wanted to avoid the controversy, but even the Navadvipa's inspector of police, whose name was Jathindra Sinha at that time, he arrived at that place apprehending some breach of peace.

**Summary:** This segment narrates how Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur asserted his right to prepare Srila Gaur Kishodas Babaji Maharaj's samadhi by challenging the purity of other claimants, ultimately establishing his position as the true disciple.

So after much discussions, the other Vaishnavas who were running different ashrams and mats, they stated their position to the inspector. That Saraswati Thakur is not a sannyasi. He has no right to prepare a samadhi for a person who is completely renounced. Hearing their pronouncement, Saraswati Thakur replied in a voice like thunder, "I am the sole disciple of Paramahamsa Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj. Even though I have not accepted sannyas, I am a celibate brahmachari, and by the grace of Babaji Maharaj, I am not hypocritical, renunciant, addicted to abominable habits." So he put a challenge for those people who within the last one year or six months or three months or just even one month or even three days has not indulged in illicit association with women will be able to touch the spiritually blissful body of Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj. If anyone else touches the body, he will be completely ruined. Hearing these words, the inspector of police asked Srila Saraswati Thakur, "How will evidence for this be produced?" So Saraswati Thakur replied, "I will believe whatever they say. Let them just tell it. That's all." After this challenge is offered, all the other Babaji's, they turned their backs and went away one by one. That means they all accepted that they were not leading a pure life. The inspector was dumbfounded. Then, Srila Bhaktisiddhan Saraswati Thakur actually prepared a nice samadhi and laid to rest the blissful transcendental body of Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj. So let us end this presentation with the prayer to Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj. Namo Gaurakeshwaraya Sakshad Vairagya Murtaye Vipralambhara Sambhode Padambhu Jayate Namaha. The meaning is, I offer my respectful obeisances unto Srila Gaurakeshwara das Babaji Maharaj, the spiritual master of Srila Bhaktisiddhan Saraswati Thakur, whose renunciation personified, Sakshad Vairagya Murti, he is always merged in a feeling of separation from an intense love of Krishna.

And when you become a Vaishnava, even karma you cross, you will be able to do work which is not even your nature. If that work is for Krishna, you will transcend even karma. We do not care. Your birth is Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, we do not care. Come surrender to Krishna and develop Vaishnava culture, Brahmanical culture.

**Summary:** This segment narrates how the three brothers settled in Malda, became attractive figures in society, and were eventually pressured by Nawab Hussain Shah to become ministers.

After Kumara Deva had died, these three brothers came over and settled here at Malda, where they continued with their studies. As they grew up, they became exceptionally attractive to all of the society. They possessed beautiful bodily features, noble character and natural compassion towards every living being. They were embodiments of the Lord's love. These three brothers studied the science of logic, Nyaya, and the knowledge of the divine. They were also the descendants of Madhusudana Vachaspati, who was the brother of Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya. They also became proficient in Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian. When Sanatana Goswami was very young, he saw a dream in which a Brahmin gave him a copy of Srimad Bhagavatam. The next day, to his surprise, he indeed received Srimad Bhagavatam. From then on, Shri Sanatana began scrutinizingly studying Srimad Bhagavatam, leaving aside all other scriptures. Bengal, during that time, was under the Mughal rule of Nawab Hussain Shah. He is the same king who had employed Shri Mukunda Dasa of Shrikhanda as his personal doctor. Seeing the popularity of Shri Rupa and Sanatana amongst the great general populace, the Nawab decided to employ them as his ministers. In this way, he planned to bring the entire Hindu population under his control. If Rupa and Sanatana joined him, then his subjects would become more submissive, he thought. On the other hand, he notified Shri Rupa and Sanatana, telling them that if they became the ministers, he would award the Vaishnavas and Hindus with all freedom. Instead, if they did not accept his proposal, then he would torture and prosecute the masses.

Due to their close proximity with the Muslims, the two brothers were excommunicated from the Hindu society by the orthodox caste Brahmins of Gaur Mandala. Thus, Shri Rupa Goswami came to be known as Dabarkhas and Shri Sanatana as Sakaramalik. The king grew very fond of them and considered them his own brothers. He awarded them with tremendous amounts of wealth and power. They settled down here at Ramkeli in Malda, where they constructed beautiful opulent palaces and gardens that served as a replica of Vruddhavan. Being pure devotees, Rupa and Sanatana always lived in the mood of separation from the Lord and his abode. Here at Ramkeli, the beautiful temples and ponds dug by our Goswamis are still present. The beautiful deity of Shri Madana Mohana that was installed by them over here continues to accept our humble services till this day.

**Summary:** This segment highlights the Goswamis' humility and hospitality, and describes Lord Chaitanya's visit to Ramkeli, where he attracted a large crowd and immersed them in ecstatic devotion.

They held the highest post in the government as they were very rich, yet the Goswamis did not possess even a grain of pride. People, scholars, Vaishnavas from all parts of the country would come to meet them and they would worship them with most intimate hospitality. Their humility and simplicity captured people's heart. There was a beautiful piece of architecture that we came across while visiting. This marvelous victory tower known as Firoz Minar is more than 26 meters in height. According to reliable sources, this tower was engineered by Sanatan Goswami while he served as Bengal Gov. Lord Chaitanya, during his second attempt to reach Vruddhavan, decided to take a roundabout route. Actually, his desire was not travelling to Vruddhavan, but instead he wanted to meet and shower his mercy upon Sri Rupa and Sanatana. Thousands of men accompanied the Lord during his journey. All of them were surcharged with deep ecstatic feelings, completely devoid of external consciousness and surrendering themselves completely. They sang and danced along. An ocean of love flooded the people with waves after waves of ecstasy. As the procession reached new places, more people joined. Wherever the Lord touched the ground with his lotus feet, people immediately gathered to take the dust. The people took out so much dirt that holes were created in the ground. Just by seeing the smiling face of the Lord, all their lamentations and unhappinesses became vanquished. Eventually, the Lord arrived at Ramkeli, where innumerable people arrived to take his darshan.

**Summary:** This segment details Nawab Hussain Shah's reaction to Lord Chaitanya's popularity, Keshava Chhatri's diplomatic response, and Rupa Goswami's glorification of Chaitanya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Performing Sankirtana over here, the Lord danced and sometimes lost his consciousness out of intense love of God. When Nawab Hussain Shah came to know that Lord Chaitanya was attracting so much attention, he was astonished. His spies informed him how Mahaprabhu had immersed everyone in a wave of transcendental ecstasy. He learned how the people, irrespective of their caste, creed or religion, were raising their hands and engaging in the congregational chanting of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. So the Nawab then asked Keshava Chhatri whether he knew anything about Lord Chaitanya. Keshava, in spite of knowing everything, tried to diplomatically downplay the situation. He replied that Chaitanya Deva was simply a touring mendicant and that only a few people had come to see him. He warned the King against considering the advice of his spies too seriously. After pacifying the King in this way, Keshava sent a Brahmana messenger to Lord Chaitanya, requesting him to leave without delay. The King then inquired from Rupa Goswami Dabarkas and asked his opinion. Rupa Goswami glorified Sri Chaitanya and revealed that he was none other than the Supreme Personality of God and Himself. He added that it was the Nawab's great fortune that the Lord has chosen to descend and manifest his pastime in this country. It was only by Mahaprabhu's mercy that the Nawab was enlightened. The Nawab was successful and victorious in all his affairs. The Nawab agreed with Rupa Goswami and remarked that he would perceive in his mind as well that Lord Chaitanya was none other than his worshipable God.

Raja kahe suno suna mora mane ye laya sakshadi saraiha nahika samshayam chaitany chaitam tata. Sri Rupa and Sanatana then began considering how they could meet Lord Chaitanya incognito. Thus, in the dead of the night, the two brothers went to meet the Lord. First, they met Nityananda Prabhu and Haridas Dhaka who introduced them to Sri Gaurahari. Out of great humility, the two brothers held straw between their teeth and fell down like a rod before Mahaprabhu. They were so overwhelmed that they began crying in joy. They introduced themselves as the lowest of men who were employed in the worst kind of employment. They glorified the Lord as Patitapavana, the deliverer of the fallen, and assured him that none in the world qualified as being more fallen than them. Out of sheer humility, they declared themselves millions of times more fallen than even Jagai and Madai, the sinful brothers whom Lord Chaitanya had previously delivered. Jagai and Madai are millions of times more virtuous. Adhamma and Patita are sinners. We are two people. Thus, they tried to establish themselves as the befitting candidates upon which Lord Chaitanya should shower his costless mercy. Hearing their prayers, Lord Chaitanya became very pleased and blessed them wholeheartedly. He then revealed that the two brothers were his eternal servants. Mahaprabhu also informed them that he had received several of their letters, which reflected their humble state of mind and consciousness. He accepted them and awarded them the name Rupa unto Dhabi's caste and Sanatana unto Sakara-Malik.

**Summary:** This segment describes Lord Chaitanya assuring Rupa and Sanatana of his protection, their advice for him to leave Ramkeli, and his subsequent departure, followed by his disclosure of his mercy to his associates in Puri.

The Lord also revealed that he had come to Ramkali only to meet and bless the two of them. He assured them of his protection and asked them not to worry. He added that they would be delivered very soon. The two brothers then sought the blessings of the Vaishnava's presence. Before leaving, however, they humbly cautioned the Lord that although the nabob was favorable at that moment, his mood was unpredictable. By nature, the nabob was a very dangerous and a very violent man. Hence, they suggested that it would be better if Mahaprabhu departed from that place without further delay. They also added that it would not be very appropriate for Mahaprabhu to travel to Vrindavan, accompanying such thousands of followers. Instead, it would be more befitting if Mahaprabhu went alone, accompanied by a select few. Having spoken thus, the two brothers offered prayers unto the lotus feet of the Lord and returned to their homes. Although Sri Chaitanya was the Supreme Lord himself, yet he acted like a mere human. In order to teach us neophytes how to react in such situations, heeding the advice of Rupa and Sanatana, he decided to leave that village. In the morning, he left for a place called Kanenaarsala, where he relished many past times of Lord Krishna. Then, thinking about the words of Sanatana, Mahaprabhu concluded that it would indeed not be proper to travel to Vrindavan with so many followers as it might disturb the atmosphere of the dhamma. Thus, he decided to return to Jagannath Puri. On returning to Puri, the Lord disclosed to his intimate associates

how he had bestowed his most intimate mercy upon Rupa and Sanatana, owing to their humility and pure devotional qualities. Rupa Goswami took all his treasures and loaded them into a boat. He and his younger brother, Anupama, left for their ancestral home at Fateh Bar, presently in Bangladesh, where they distributed all their wealth. He appointed a brahmana to perform auspicious ceremonies so that they might obtain the shelter of Mahaprabhu. Of his wealth, he gave 50% charity to the brahmanas and Vaishnavas and 25% to his relatives. Srila Prabhupada highly glorifies and hails this as a perfect example of how one should divide his money and retire from one's household life. He also deposited 10,000 gold coins with a grocer in order to help Sanatana Goswami to escape. Sri Rupa Goswami kept one-fourth of his wealth aside with a respectable brahmana for his personal safety and emergencies. Srila Rupa Goswami then set out with two men to find out where Mahaprabhu was, when Mahaprabhu would be leaving for Vrindavan from Jagannath Puri. The men came back with news that Lord Chaitanya had already left. Sri Rupa immediately wrote a letter to Sanatana Goswami informing him of the news. He also added that he and Anupama were living immediately from Vrindavan and asked Sanatana Goswami to set off as well. He also informed his elder brother that he had left 10,000 gold coins with a grocer to help him escape.

Meanwhile, Sanatana Goswami stopped going to the office and would just remain at home reading and chanting Srimad Bhagavatam all day. In the assembly of devotees, Nawab Hussain Shah came to his residence to enquire about Sanatana's health as he thought he was sick. Seeing that he was perfectly fit, the Nawab asked Sanatana to assist him in attacking the province of Orissa. Sanatana Goswami refused to obey the order of the king and expressed his desire to retire from service instead. The king became enraged and ordered Sanatana's arrest. Using the money that Rupa Goswami had kept for him, Sanatana Goswami managed to bribe the jailer and somehow escaped. The jailer was initially reluctant to release him, but 7,000 gold coins were enough to change his position. On being released, Sanatana immediately crossed over the Ganges and fled. He passed through hilly terrains and spent the night at a small hotel on his way to Benares. The hotel owner, knowing that Sanatana's servant Isha had eight gold coins in his possession, wanted to murder both of them and take away the money. However, Isha could guess the evil plans of the hotel owner and voluntarily offered him the coins and sought his help to safely reach his destination. Thus, the owner helped them cross the hilly track and proceed towards Varanasi.

**Summary:** This segment describes Rupa and Sanatana's travels through Vraja Mandala, their renounced lifestyle, their devotional practices, and their establishment of deity worship in Vrindavan.

Both Rupa and Sanatana travelled extensively through Vraja Mandala, discovering many pastimes, places of Radha Madhava. Having no fixed residence, they would catch a few winks of sleep, no more than one and a half hours per day, under a tree or bush. They used to live by whatever little they obtained, by performing Madhukari, begging from door to door. Shri Rupa and Sanatana spent all their time writing, discussing Krishna pastimes, and chanting Krishna's holy names. Shri Rupa Goswami established the worship of Shri Radha Govinda Dev in Vrindavan, while Shri Sanatana inaugurated the worship of Shri Madan Mohana. Both of these enchanting deities are currently being worshipped in Rajasthan. So the different things we see in Ramkeli here are the temples. That is this temple where we are sitting. That is Radha Madan Mohan Deity, established by Rupa and Sanatana. We also have Balarama and Revati. And they also established Chaitanya. Three Deities of the Pancha Tattva. Pancha Tattva have five personalities, but installed three personalities here: Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the middle, Nityananda on the left, and Advaita on the right. So three personalities they installed here. There is this Keli Kadamba tree, under which Chaitanya Mahaprabhu met Rupa and Sanatana. And there is a small temple and the entrance of Govinda Hari's lotus feet. There is Rupa Sagar, a large pond excavated by Sri Rupa Goswami.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Bhagavad-gita is a mystery that can only be understood by devotees, not by those with superficial interpretations.

This is a very important verse to understand Bhagavad-gītā. By rascal interpretation, you cannot understand what is Bhagavad-gītā. It is a mystery, rahāsyam, mysterious. Only a devotee... who is in intimate relation with Kṛṣṇa, he can understand. That is clearly stated here. When Kṛṣṇa was speaking Bhagavad-gītā to Arjuna, it was in the battlefield. It is not a parlor, discussing, smoking and discussing business. No. It is not like that. Very serious, in the battlefield. And Kṛṣṇa selected Arjuna. At that time, when Kṛṣṇa was present, there were very, very great learned scholars. Even Vyāsadeva was present there, the Veda-vyāsa, and many others. Asita, Devaloka, great, great saintly persons and saints. Rājarṣis. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was rājarṣi because in the previous verse he says, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ. So why he selected Arjuna? He was a military man. He was not a Vedāntist. A military man is not supposed to become a Vedāntist, very great sannyāsī. No. Because the so-called Vedāntists, they cannot understand Bhagavad-gītā. It is not possible. It is a mystery. Kṛṣṇa in other places says, nāhaṁ prakāśa-sarvasya-yoga-māyā-samābhṛtaḥ. I cannot be exposed to anyone. Yoga-māyā-samābhṛtaḥ. Therefore those who are fools, rascals, they consider Kṛṣṇa as fictitious, Kṛṣṇa as a human being, Kṛṣṇa as a historical person, or there was no Kṛṣṇa, it is an imaginary writing. Because these rascals, they cannot understand. Unless one is a bona fide devotee and intimately related with Kṛṣṇa,

**Summary:** The speaker explains that hearing about Krishna is the beginning of bhakti, and discusses the Vedic principles, the relationship with God, and Krishna as the original father.

tan manye adhitaṁ uttamaṁ. This is the statement of Prahlāda Mahārāja. These are the bhakti process. If one wants to become bhakta, then he must begin with śravaṇaṁ. Just like you have kindly come here to hear about Kṛṣṇa. This is the beginning of bhakti. Unless you hear about the Supreme Person, that is Vedic process, śruti. Śruti. Veda is known as śruti. Śruti-śmiti-pūrānādi-pāñcarātrika-vidhiṁ vinā ahikāntaki harer bhakti utpātāya-vakalpataḥ. If one does not follow the principle, Vedic principle, smṛti, the Vedic corollaries, smṛti means literature which is written according to Vedic principle. That is called smṛti. And śruti means the Vedas. Bhaktā-śrūta-gṛhitaya. Śrūta-gṛhitaya. Śrūta-gṛhitās are two meanings: by hearing or through the Vedic literature. Through the Vedic literature, only bhaktis. There are three kinds of departmental study in the Vedas. First thing is sambandha. Sambandha means what is my relationship with God. This is stated there. In the Vedānta it is said, janmādy asya yataḥ. The absolute truth is that from whom everything is generated. So everything amongst everything I am also. You are also. So you are also coming from that supreme absolute truth. Kṛṣṇa says, mam evāṁśa jīva-bhūtaḥ. All these living entities, sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya, in every species, any form of life, saṁyavanti-mūrtaḥ, as many forms are there, not only human being, the animals. The trees, the birds, the aquatics, the insects, everyone, all living entities. Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya saṁyavanti-mūrtaḥ. In any species of life, as many forms are there, ahaṁ vija-pradabhitāḥ. I am their original father. Vija-pradabhitāḥ, seed-giving father. So as father places the seeds within the womb of the mother, similarly the material nature is the mother, and Kṛṣṇa is the father. Kṛṣṇa impregnates the material nature, and we come out in different forms.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the different forms of life and explains that the human form of life provides the opportunity to understand God.

Seda-ya, udvija, and jarā-yuja, and anda-ya. Seda-ya means by perspiration, through perspiration. That is like bed bugs. Bed bugs, because if you keep your bed nasty, do not keep it very clean, then by your perspiration there is generation of these bed bugs. They are called seda-ya, by perspiration. And anda-ya, through the eggs, just like the birds, the living entities coming through the eggs. That is called anda-ya. Seda-ya, anda-ya, jarā-yuja, embryo. Just like we are coming from the embryo, anda-ya, jarā-yuja, and udvija. Coming from the seeds, the trees, plants. So within these four groups, all different living entities are coming. So by gradual evolution we are coming to the human form of life. So in the human form of life, here there is a prerogative, there is a chance to know what is God.

And what is my relationship with Him. That is called sambandha-jñāna. Sambandha-avideya. Then execution of the duty. Just like sambandha, we can understand, an unmarried girl, an unmarried boy, there is first of all sambandha. The father-mother makes the relationship. Then there is function between husband and wife. That is called avideya. And why? No, because there is a necessity. What is that? To get children. Sambandha, avideya, preya-ja. Preya-ja. Every sambandha, every relationship is made, every action is done with the aim, the goal, the preya-ja. So Vedic literature means sambandha, avideya and preya-ja. That is to be studied in the human form of life. Vedaisya sarvair aham eva vedyam. To study Vedas means to understand what is my relationship, what is Kṛṣṇa, what I am, and what is my relationship, and how to act in that relationship, and what is the aim of life.

The aim of life is to go back to home, back to garden. That is aim of life. We are fallen in this material condition of life. You are suffering. But we do not know. We are so full, just like animal. We do not know what is the aim of life. Aim of life, that is also described in the Bhagavad-gītā. Jarma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-dūśānudarśanam. When we can understand that this process of repetition of birth, death, old age and disease, this is not wanted by me, nobody wants to die, but the death is forced upon him. He does not think that this is my problem. I do not want to die, but death is as sure as anything. So this is the problem. Nobody is careful how to solve this problem. They are simply engaged in the, I mean to say, temporary problems. The temporary problems are not problems. Real problem is how to stop death, how to stop birth, how to stop old age and how to stop disease. That is real problem.

That can be done when you are liberated from this material world. This is our problem. So Kṛṣṇa comes here again. Yadā yadā hi dharmasya jñāni bhavati bhārata. Dharmasya jñāni. Jñāni means when it is distorted. So people are manufacturing in the name of so-called religion. This is our religion, this is Hindu religion, this is Muslim religion, this is Christian religion, this is Buddha religion, and this is Sikh religion, this is that religion, that religion. They have manufactured so many religions, so many religions. But real religion is dharmanta-sākṣād bhagavat-pranam. Religion means the codes and the laws given by the Lord, given by God. That is religion. Simple definition of religion is dharmanta-sākṣād bhagavat-pranetam. Just like law is given by the state, by the government. You cannot manufacture law. I have repeatedly said. Law is made by the government. Similarly, religion is made by God. If you accept God's religion, then that is religion. And what is God's religion? If you stand, you can stand here. Other people are sitting. God's religion is, you'll find in the Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.

**Summary:** The speaker advocates surrendering to God, becoming a devotee, and chanting Hare Krishna, especially in this age.

This is God's religion. You give up all this nonsense religion. You become a devotee, a surrendered soul unto Me. That is the religion. One who does not know what is God, one who does not know how to surrender to Him, he is not religious. Any religion without the conception of God, without knowledge of God, without knowing the surrendering process, that is called, described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as cheating religion, dharma-projjhita-kaitava-atra. The so-called religious system, which is cheating only, that kind of religion is completely thrown away, kicked out. Because religion means to develop your dormant love for God or to execute the laws of God. That is it. The laws of God is, Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja. And how to achieve that? That also Kṛṣṇa said: man-manā bhava-bhaktah mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru. Four principles only. Only. Always think of Me, Hare Kṛṣṇa. If you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, then you are remembering Kṛṣṇa. Man-manāḥ. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is the religion, at least of this age. Hare nāma, Hare nāma, Hare nāma eva kevalam kalau nāsteva nāsteva nāsteva gati hraṇyata. There is no other way.

But people do not know. They are not educated. What is God? What is God's place? Where to go back? What is my position? What is my relation? Nothing of these things are educated or given lessons in any university, anywhere. But it is there, the Bhagavad-gītā. Kṛṣṇa is personally giving him instruction. Kṛṣṇa is giving instruction to Arjuna. Arjuna does not mean that… Arjuna is to take that lesson. Every one of us. And it is very old. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, don't manufacture new type of religion. What you will do then? It is simply waste of time. You cannot manufacture anything. But thereafter modernized religion. What is this nonsense, modernized religion? You are living entity. You are part and parcel of God. It is old relationship. Purāṇa. It is said purāṇa. Purāṇa means very old. na jāyate na abhryate vāt kadācit nitya-śāśvatayam purāṇa. We have to accept that purāṇa. We are purāṇa, eternal. na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre. We are not destroyed simply by destruction of this body. We remain. We accept another body. tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tattva-numayate.

This is eternal relationship. It cannot be broken. But you have forgotten. You have forgotten your relationship with Kṛṣṇa. You have made your relationship with your family, so-called family, so-called country, so-called society, and so on, so on, so on, so on. This is all temporary. Suppose I am Indian today. You are American today. But is there a guarantee after your death you will become American or I will become Indian? Or I will take my birth in the same family? No. According to my karma, I may become cats and dogs. You may become demigods. You may become something else. But dehāntara-prāptir. Dehāntara-prāptir, you will have to accept another body. And there are 8,400,000 species or forms of body. Any of them you will have to accept. Prakṛteḥ kriyamārāṇi guṇaiḥ karmaṇi sarvaśaḥ. You are wasting your time as the family member or as a national or this or that. But there is no guarantee that next life we will be same countrymen or same family. No, there is no such guarantee.

And that body means any out of these four, according to my karma. karmaṇā daiva-natreṇa yanto deha-upapatti. So these are the instructions of the śāstras. And this is very scientific and very important thing. But unfortunately you are not taking care of these things. You are very busy with the temporary problems. Temporary problems are not problems. That is also stated in the Bhagavad-gītā. āgama-pāina anityātāṁ titikṣaśya bhārataḥ mātrāś paraśāstha-kaunteya śrī-daśna-śukha-dakkha-dāntaḥ. Your temporary problems, so-called happiness and distress, these are āgama-pāina. They come and go. That is not very important. Just like the seasonal changes. The winter season comes and again goes on. For the time being you may feel very cold, but it will go. Similarly, summer season also. It comes and goes, any seasonal changes. We should not be disturbed with the seasonal changes of happiness and distress.

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of spiritual advancement and developing the intelligence to recognize and address the problem of death, contrasting it with an animalistic focus on bodily comfort.

We should be very serious about the problems of life: janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vādi. That is spiritual advancement. Unless we come to the serious point, unless you have become very intelligent, that I do not want to die. Why death is there? This is intelligence. You may solve your temporary problem, but you cannot by your so-called materialistic activities. The problem of death. Nobody wants to die. mṛtyu-sarva-harasya-haṁ. Death will come. But the people have become so much unintelligent, they do not take up seriously the real problems. Just like animals. The animals is being taken to the slaughterhouse. One animal enters to the slaughterhouse store, livestock store. All the animals enters. He does not know that this, I have to stay here for being killed. He does not know. This is animal. Similarly, if you do not take this problem seriously, you are no better than animal. However, you may be advanced for this bodily comfort. You are animal. yasyānta-buddhi-kuṇapeti-dhātuke. This bag of three elements, kava-vitva-vayu, if I think that I am this body and the comfort of this body is my happiness, sa eva go-kharo, you are no better than animal. This is animal conception of life. You must know that I am not this body. I am spirit soul. Circumstantially I have been put into this body, and again I will be put into another body. So what is the solution of this problem? That is Bhagavad-gītā.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa is saying, this is old. It is not new type of religion. It is the oldest. Bhagavad-bhakti. Bhagavan is there, and the living entities are there. Their relationship is there. Now by forgetting God, forgetting Kṛṣṇa, you are busy with the temporary problems, but you are forgetting the real problem. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, the bhaktoṣi, one has to become bhakto. The bhakto means Bhagavan. If there is Bhagavan, then there is bhakto, and there is bhakti. But these people are denying the existence of Bhagavan. There is no God. Then how He can become bhakto? Or how there will be execution of bhakti? Bhakto bhagavān bhakti. The same thing. Bhakto is in relationship with Bhagavan, and the transaction between Bhagavan and bhakto is called bhakti.

**Summary:** The speaker provides definitions of bhakti and emphasizes the importance of kirtana (chanting) and hearing about Krishna.

Bhakti. Bhakti means ānukulyena kṛṣṇa-anusilaṇaṁ anyā vilāśitā sunyaṁ jñāna-karmādana-vṛtaṁ ānukulyena kṛṣṇa-anusilaṇaṁ bhakti-vṛttamaḥ. This is the definition given by Rūpa Gosvāmī. Similarly, in Nārada-pañcarātra, the bhakti is defined: sarva-pādhi-vinirmaktaṁ tat-paratyena nirmanam rīśi-keṇa-rīśi-keśa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate. These are the definition of bhakti. Bhakti, without bhakti, nobody can become bhakti. Bhakti means one who is executing bhakti. That is bhakti. And the beneficiary, the beneficiary is the Bhagavān. So those who are engaged in this process of bhakti, sarva-nām kīrtanaḥ Viṣṇu, Viṣṇu means Bhagavān, or Kṛṣṇa. So sarva-nām kīrtanaḥ, you have to hear about Kṛṣṇa. That is sarva-nām. And kīrtanaḥ, one has to chant, This is also kīrtanaḥ. I am speaking to you. This is also kīrtanaḥ. When you are hearing, this is bhakti. Sarva-nām kīrtanaḥ, about Kṛṣṇa. The chanting, dancing about Kṛṣṇa, this is bhakti. Sarva-nām kīrtanaḥ, Viṣṇu.

Smaraṇaṁ, and remembering about Kṛṣṇa. Man-manā bhava-bhakti. If you engage your mind, savai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayaḥ, we have to fix up our mind always to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. So if you do not accept this object, this temple worship, how you can become always be engaged in the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa? These are the processes. These are not sentiments. This is the scientific process. If you want, your business is to become bhakti, that is perfection. And because Arjuna was bhakti, therefore Kṛṣṇa is speaking to him. So if you become, it is not monopolized by Arjuna. If you also become bhakti, Kṛṣṇa will speak to you. Now he says, where is God? Where is God? Here is God. God is speaking. Why don't you see God? God is speaking. You'll find in the seventh chapter, if you cannot see God, if you cannot see Kṛṣṇa in the temple, if you cannot see Kṛṣṇa within Bhagavad-gītā, then Kṛṣṇa says, raśo'haṁ apsukam teyaḥ prabhāsaṁ miṣaśa-śūryaḥ. You see while you drink water. Or anything you drink, you can see Kṛṣṇa there. Raśo. That taste is Kṛṣṇa. So there is no difficulty to see God. These rascals, they said, where is God? Here is God. You are drinking water. Why don't you see? Give me water. So Kṛṣṇa can be seen always, provided you want to see God. But you don't want to see God. That is the difficulty.

Illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. That's all. You have to give up this.

Anyā yathāndhairu punyam ānā. Blind man is leading other man. Therefore there is no solution. Why the world is in chaos? Why the world is in chaos? Because the world is in chaos. Because leaders are all sinful. These are the sinful definition. triyas sunā pāṇudūta yatra pāpaśyata-durvedāḥ. So God's sin is not very difficult, provided you are purified, you are pure. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is purificatory process. Purificatory process. The first condition, we do not accept any rascal who is addicted to these four principles. We do not make cheap disciples. Our condition is, first of all, you must give up these things, illicit sex and meat-eating and intoxication, up to the drinking of tea and cigarette. You have to give up gambling. They are nice boys. They have given up. They are addicted to all these habits in their previous life, but they have given up. Therefore they are making progress.

santā. They have become santā, saintly persons. So Kṛṣṇa is parampavitra. Arjuna, when addressed Kṛṣṇa after reading Bhagavad-gītā, after addressing, parambrahma-parandhāma pavitraṁ paramambhavār. He understood. pavitraṁ paramambhavār. You are the most pure. You cannot approach the most pure if you are impure. You must be pure. Therefore this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is a purificatory process. The more you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, you become purified. ceta-darpaṇamāryaṇaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam śreya-kairava-candra-kāvitaraṇaṁ vidyā-bhada-jīvaṇaṁ ānanda-ambudhi-vardhanam pratibhadam pūrṇā-mṛtā-śvādanaṁ ānanda-ambudhi-vardhanam pratibhadam pūrṇā-mṛtā-śvādanaṁ sarvātma-sapanaṁ param vijayati śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṁkīrtanaṁ. So take to this Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. It is very easy. Even a child can take part. You see, those children, they are not born of brāhmaṇa family or this family or that family. Never mind. Because they are taking part in chanting and dancing, they are becoming purified. Every step of their dancing, being... Being noted, being noted. Ajñāta-śukṛtiḥ chatur-vidā-bhajante māṁ.

The question was, after the departure of Kṛṣṇa, dharma, kaṁ, what is that, sarnā-gata, kārthaṁ, what is that? This is the inquiry. The answer is given there. Sir, your inquiry, Kṛṣṇa comes for re-establishing the principles of religion. That's it. Lillian means the order set by the Supreme Personality of God. That is lillian. You do like this, just like king's order, or the government order, do like this. Loose and, does not, So that is dharma. If you follow the do's and do nots given by Kṛṣṇa, that is a lie. You cannot manufacture it. That is bogus. So munayam svayabhu kṛṣṇa-bhagavad-vī-loka-maṅgalam. This question, just like our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, is the same.

**Summary:** Hearing about Kṛṣṇa's attractive qualities and activities guarantees liberation, as Kṛṣṇa comes to re-establish religious principles.

Kṛṣṇa saṅkṣu, cīnātmā suprasūdhī. Another feature is, Kṛṣṇa is all-attractive, therefore talks about Him is also attractive. In our Kṛṣṇa book, there are so many topics about Kṛṣṇa. Janma karma-mṛdivyam, about His birth, about His transference from real father's house to another foster father. Then the attack by the demon upon Kṛṣṇa, kaṁsau, all these activities. If we simply study and hear the Kṛṣṇa saṅkṣu-prasṇā, then we are liberated. Without any doubt, our liberation is guaranteed simply by hearing about Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa therefore comes, so many activities. Na māṅg karmānī limpaṇṭhī na me kaṇva-pareśa-prihāḥ. Kṛṣṇa says that He has nothing to do. What He has to do? But still He is killing so many demons, He is giving protection to so many devotees, because He has come to reestablish what is religious principle. So by His personal activities, He's telling, otherwise, Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do. Nā mā rāma kṛṣṇaḥ. He is self-satisfied. He has nothing to do. But to teach us, He comes. In this way we should live, from the very beginning of His childhood.

**Key Quote:** "The ultimate Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa, the person."
**Summary:** The human form of life is meant for inquiring about the Absolute Truth, with Kṛṣṇa being the ultimate Absolute Truth, surpassing the understanding of Paramātmā and brahma effulgence.

Athāta brahma-jīgānta. Athā. Now, this is the time for inquiring about the Absolute Truth. This is the time, means, this human form of life. Animals cannot inquire. So therefore Vedānta Sutra says athā, athā, brahma-jīgānta, inquire about the Absolute Truth. Brahma, brahmeti, paramātmeti, bhagavān eti sadyati. The ultimate Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa, the person. Paramātmā is plenary expansion. And brahma, he is impersonal, effulgent. So if one understands Kṛṣṇa by question and answer, then he understands the other three features. But simply by understanding the impersonal feature, brahma effulgence, one cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Neither by understanding or seeing the Paramātmā, one can understand Kṛṣṇa. To see the Paramātmā is the business of the yogis. dhyānā-vasthita-tad-gatena-manuṣā patsyante saṁyam yogiḥ. Yogina, the yogi, they are trying to see Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu within their heart by meditation.

The idea was that we shall show something opulent, that we are very great nation. We have got nice buildings, nice churches, nice roads, swapsa. Everyone wants to be swapsa before his friends and relatives. So this is materialism. But the same thing done for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, that we shall construct this temple for Kṛṣṇa's inauguration. We shall construct this building for providing devotees of Kṛṣṇa so that they may be able to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra without any disturbance. It appears the same thing, karma and bhakti. But bhakti is always in relation with Kṛṣṇa, and karma is always in relation with sense gratification. Therefore the thing, the ingredient, is originally spiritual, because it is Kṛṣṇa's energy. But ahaṁ mamṛti, when we try to impose our proprietorship, that is materialism. Materialism means forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise there is no materialism.

**Key Quote:** "That will solve all social problems."
**Summary:** Introducing Kṛṣṇa consciousness into family life through acca-vigraha-seva can solve social problems by centering activities around Kṛṣṇa.

So in Kṛṣṇa center, even in Kṛṣṇa center, we are having different opinions, because we are accustomed to live like that. But actually, if we are serious about serving Kṛṣṇa, then there cannot be two people. One of them. How to serve Kṛṣṇa? So in family life, if we introduce this acca-vigraha-seva, every family can see Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa-vigraha, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's photo, vigraha. And as we are, whatever we are doing, center is Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, everyone can do that. That will solve all social problems.

**Key Quote:** "So without being Kṛṣṇa conscious, there is no end of social problems."
**Summary:** Kṛṣṇa consciousness can resolve economic and social problems by fostering satisfaction and reducing the endless pursuit of more money.

Social problems, political problems, economic problems. Economic problem, practically there is no economic problem. Just like in London, they are throwing away tons of tomatoes. It will be seed. That is our clue. God has given sufficient to eat. But because there is strike, we have created a problem. So if one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, what is this strike? Strike means they want money, more money, more money. There is no end. When I first came to America and New York, there was strike of the transport man. All transports stopped. The subway, the bus, everything. People became so much in difficulty. So without being Kṛṣṇa conscious, there is no end of social problems. There is no end of self-justification. Nobody knows.

**Summary:** Instead of focusing on improving economic policy, one should utilize their time in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa for peace of mind and satisfaction.

But Kṛṣṇa conscious person, they are satisfied. Even still in India, you will find this satisfaction by Kṛṣṇa conscious. A poor man, practically very big income, but he is satisfied. He is satisfied in this way. He thinks, Kṛṣṇa has given me this much. I must receive this much. Kṛṣṇa has given me this much. Why should I eat? And that is also recommendation of the śāsyas, that tasya-yoheta-pratyate tatha-vidah nanabhate yantra-matāṁ kare. We should not waste our time for improving our economic policy. That is already settled up. So whatever Kṛṣṇa will do, that is all right. Let me utilize my valuable time of this human form of life in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Summary:** Saintly persons dedicated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness rely on Kṛṣṇa for their needs, exemplified by the story of Gīla Maṁgata, who received personal care from Kṛṣṇa.

People will not agree to this, but actually if anyone wants peace of the mind, jñātmā-śutra-siddhanti, then this process will be allowed. This is practical also. There are many saintly persons. They do not try where to go, where to take money, or where to eat. They are busy in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If Kṛṣṇa sends some food, I shall eat. Otherwise it doesn't matter. I shall starve. Then what is their determination? Spirit. They do not go anywhere. But Kṛṣṇa sends it, everything. Just like Gīla Maṁgata. Just like Gīla Maṁgata. He was not going anywhere. He was living in Vrndavana. Kṛṣṇa personally was coming to give him something. He became blind. He could not see. So Kṛṣṇa would come just like a boy. Gīla Maṁgata, I think you are hungry. Will you take some milk? I am not very good. All right, so give me little milk. Next day he comes. Then he would ask, who is this boy? I cannot see. He comes and gives me milk daily. Yuga-kemaṁ bhāmaḥ. In the Bhagavad-gītā he said that, until the devotee is completely dependent upon me, I carry personally whatever he needs. Yuga-bhūṇāṁ vṛnda-kāmaḥ. That one person is supplying all the necessities of all the living entities.

That is God. God is not beggar. God fulfills everyone's necessities. Freshly carried. So that is, people are unhappy by so-called economic development. Everyone is competing. They have no satisfaction. Without God, godless civilization is created. Unnecessary competition. But if you become God-conscious, he'll be satisfied. Jaya ātmāḥ sattva-śrīve.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the true purpose of knowledge is to understand and glorify Kṛṣṇa, the infallible purpose.

Now, śāstra says that avicchito artha, artha means purpose. If somebody asks what is the purpose of becoming a scientist, what is the purpose of becoming a physicist? So different men will give different answers. It is meant for this purpose, it is meant for this purpose. But kavi bhi, those who are actually learned, advanced learning, they have said that avicchito, avicchito means without any failure, without any contradiction. You say that chemistry is required for this purpose. I say chemistry is required for this purpose. Another man says chemistry is required for this purpose. But difference of opinion, that is not accepted. Avicchito, infallible purpose. What is that infallible purpose? Avicchito artha. Kavi bhi nirupita. Nirupita means it is already settled. You haven't got to make research anymore. Nirupita means it is already settled. It is already concluded. What is that? Yad uttama-sloka-guṇa-anuvarnanam. If you can explain the activities of Kṛṣṇa, uttama-sloka, how He is acting, how the chemical process is going on under His direction, if you can write a thesis on this subject matter, then ultimately Kṛṣṇa is behind that, then your study of chemistry is perfect.

Nirupitam, it is concluded. No more argument. That is the purpose. That means if you are intelligent enough, actually, then through any source of knowledge you come ultimately to Kṛṣṇa. That mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ śrūyate śrī-cāryaḥ. Kṛṣṇa says, but if by your education, if you come to the same point, that here is Kṛṣṇa, He is in the background, sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇaṁ, cause of all causes, then education is perfect. Otherwise it is śrama eva hi kevalam. Otherwise it is simply laboring for nothing. Waste of time. This is the purpose. Aviccita-artha-kavirbhi-nirupitam. Yad uttamaḥ śloka-guṇānubhanyanam. So parāśa-śakti-bhībhi-daivaśyate. Very, very big chemistry, physical laws, mathematics, everything is required to understand the potency of God. How He is working. Actually everything is being done by His potency. Here there are different tests. The material is the same, but the method of mixing the material, different tests are coming out in existence. So how that expertly management of mixing is going on, if we can explain by our chemistry, by our mathematical values, then our studying of the material is going to be very, very

He is not taking any credit for himself. Neither it is possible. Even he may be very, very big devotee, he will never claim any credit for his glorious activities.

Don't think the sun is working so nicely. Automatical, not automatical. The master is there, Kṛṣṇa. The sun is so powerful substance within this universe. There are many millions of suns. This is one sun only. But it is carrying out the order of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa. yaccha kṣuresa śavitā śagala-grhānā rājā samastha śra-mṛti aśeṣu tezā Aśeṣu tezā. Unlimited. Light. Unlimited fire.

For millions and millions of years, it is from the sun, the light and heat is coming out, but there is no diminution. They, it is the same as it was millions of years ago, and after giving you light and heat for millions of years, the same quantity of light and heat is still there. So if it is possible for a material thing, that after giving unlimited heat and light, it remains the same. Similarly, the Supreme Lord, by expanding His potencies by His energy, He remains the same. He does not diminish. Purnasya purna-mādāya purna-mī-bhāva-śuṣyate. So if we can see in the material object that the heat being emanated from many millions and millions, it remains the same heat. It maintains the same heat, same life. Why it is not possible for the Supreme? Therefore, Īśvara-bhūta-paṇiṣāda informs us that purnasya purna-mādāya purna-mī-bhāva-śuṣyate.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the limited power of modern gurus who claim to give away their power with the unlimited potency of Kṛṣṇa, who can expand Himself without diminishing.

If you take the whole energy of Kṛṣṇa from Kṛṣṇa, then still the whole energy is there. But you'll be surprised. Nowadays, modern gods, there are so many modern gods. I do not wish to name, but one modern god, he gave his power to his disciples. And when he came to Kṛṣṇa, he gave his power to his disciples. And when he came to consciousness, then he was crying. The disciples inquired from the guru, why you are crying, sir? No, I have finished everything. I have given you everything. Therefore, I am now finished. That is not spiritual. That is material. I have got hundred rupees. If I pay you hundred rupees, then my pocket is empty. But Kṛṣṇa is not like that. Kṛṣṇa can make hundreds of thousands and millions of Kṛṣṇa, still He is Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa. The potency is never exhausted. That is called purnasya purna-mādāya purna-mī-bhāva-śuṣyate.

**Key Quote:** "We accept Kṛṣṇa, the sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam, and we want to be eternal servant."
**Summary:** The speaker rejects the idea of 'cheap gods' and emphasizes the importance of accepting Kṛṣṇa as the source of everything and becoming His eternal servant, highlighting the inherent desire for variety in our constitutional position.

And the duration of existence of each and every universe is the duration of life of Brahmā. That we cannot calculate. Even we cannot calculate His twelve hours. So that is God. We accept such kind of life. We accept such kind of God. Not a little magician. No. That is not possible. We cannot accept such cheap gods. We accept Kṛṣṇa, the sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam, and we want to be eternal servant. That is our actual position, jiveśvarūpa-nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa, by His unlimited potency, energy. Unlimited universes are coming out with unlimited number of varieties of planet. And each planet is differently situated, different atmosphere, different temperature. So in this way, varieties. That is ānanda. Kṛṣṇa has created these varieties because He is ānanda-mayo vyāsāt. Ānanda-mayo. Unless there is variety. So we are partakers. We are part and parcel of that variety maker. We are also one of the varieties. Jīva-śakti. We are also one of the varieties. So how we can become variety-less, nirvīśeṣa? That is not possible. Even artificially we try to become nirvīśeṣa, variety-less. Our constitutional position is that we want variety. How it can be stopped?

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the downfall of impersonalists and emphasizes the need to transfer our service from māyā (illusion) to Kṛṣṇa in order to achieve a successful and blissful life.

Therefore, in the śāstra it is said, so-called māyāvādī, impersonalist, monies, āryajya krccheṇa-param padanta-taḥ. Although they get up to the position of oneness, monies, but from that position they fall down. Why? āryajya krccheṇa-param padanta-taḥ, patanti adhā, ānādita jagособas vlogs. Why? Because you cannot become jīvadora. You are going to become s Sitting-abh Knights. You cannot become a teacher, good teacher, teacher, But you cannot become an ascetic. Because you cannot become a teacher, good teacher, good monk, Junga. So this is the definition of vaiṇādita-jisma-dhangrāja. Because they have no information of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, where to enjoy ānanda, ānandamaya-bhāsā. And they are by nature seeking after ānanda, the so-called oneness, monism, that will not please them. So they will require again ānanda. But because anādhita-yusmataṁ grhayaḥ, they have not worshipped Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, they come down again in this material world and worship the feet of māyā. That is their tradition. ārīja-kṛcchreṇa-parampadam tato patanti adhaḥ. And as soon as you are engaged in the service of māyā, that is your adhapatam. Adhapatam. As we, all these materialistic persons who are within this material world, you are serving māyā. Everyone is serving. Nobody is without serving. But they are serving māyā. So you have to transform, transfer your service from māyā to Kṛṣṇa. Then your life will be successful, and you will taste different varieties of prasādam perpetually and enjoy life eternally and blissfully.

**Key Quote:** "All these truths were explained to Sanatana Goswami by the Lord himself out of his causeless mercy."
**Summary:** The lecture begins with an introduction to the verses from Chaitanya Charitamrita, focusing on Krishna's identity, conjugal love, opulence, and the mellows of devotional service, all revealed to Sanatana Goswami through the Lord's mercy.

Jaya Jaya Shri Chaitanya Jaya Nithyananda Jaya Dvaita Chandra Jaya Gaurabhakta Vrinda. We are reading from Shri Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 20, entitled Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Instructs Sanatana Goswami in the Science of the Absolute Truth from verse 97 to 99. I will read 97 and 98 and will repeat verse 99. Krishna Swaroopa Madhuri Aishwarya Bhakti Rasashriyam Tatvam Sanatana Yesha Kripa Yopadi Desha Saha. Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, had personally told Sanatana Goswami about Lord Krishna's real identity. He also told him about the Lord's conjugal love, his personal opulence, and the message of love. He also told him about the Lord's conjugal love, his personal opulence, and the mellows of devotional service. All these truths were explained to Sanatana Goswami by the Lord himself out of His causeless mercy.

**Key Quote:** "Although they are fallen, if they simply submit themselves at the lotus feet of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, they will be saved from sinful reactions."
**Summary:** This segment discusses Sanatana Goswami's humility and self-identification as fallen due to association with materialistic individuals, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu for salvation from sinful reactions.

Text 98: Putting a straw in his mouth and bowing down, Sanatana Goswami clasped the lotus feet of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and humbly spoke as follows. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Shri Prabhupada. Translation: Sanatana Goswami said, "I was born in a low family and my associates are all low class men. I myself am fallen and am the lowest of men. Indeed, I have passed my whole life fallen in the well of sinful materialism." Actually, Shri Sanatana Goswami belonged to a brahmana family because he belonged to the Saraswati division of the brahmanas and was well-cultured and well-educated. Somehow or other, he accepted a ministership in the Muslim government. Therefore, he had to associate with meat-eaters, drunkards, and gross materialists. Sanatana Goswami considered himself fallen, for in the association of such men, he also fell victim to material enjoyment. Having passed his life in that way, he considered that he had wasted his valuable time. This statement about how one can become fallen in this material world is made by the greatest authority in the Gaudiya Vaishnavasampradaya. Actually, the whole world is presently fallen into material existence. Everyone is a meat-eater, drunkard, woman-hunter, gambler, and what not. People are enjoying material life by committing the four basic sins. Although they are fallen, if they simply submit themselves at the lotus feet of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, they will be saved from sinful reactions.

**Key Quote:** "These three things can be understood through devotional service by no other means."
**Summary:** This section explains that Krishna's svarupa (actual position), madhurya (attractiveness), and aisharja (opulences) can only be understood through devotional service, emphasizing that material speculation is insufficient.

Sanātana Gosvāmī is taking instruction and lessons from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And what is the subject matter of instruction that is described herein by the author of this Caitanya-caritāmī? The subject matter is Kṛṣṇa's svarūpa. What is the actual position of Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa's svarūpa, mādhujya. And what is the special attractiveness of Kṛṣṇa? Mādhujya. Kṛṣṇa's svarūpa, mādhujya, aisharja. And what are the opulences of Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa's svarūpa, mādhujya, aisharja. And what are the opulences of Kṛṣṇa? Bhakti-vāsākram. And all these, what is Kṛṣṇa? What is His special qualification for attraction? And what is His opulence? These three things can be understood through devotional service by no other means. Just like I have several times cited the example that if you want to be in confidence of a great personality, then you must satisfy him by your service. You cannot understand a big man by your speculation, even in this material world. If you want to know a big man... By disappointment. What he is. Then you must satisfy him by your service, attitude, by friendship, by love. And he will disclose to you what he's... So the same process is bhakti-vāsākram. If you want to know what is Kṛṣṇa, what is His opulence, what is his special feature for attraction, then you should try to understand by no other means anything other than Kṛṣṇa, anything.

They have no other information. Work hard, eat and be merry and enjoy. And making, that's all. So out of millions and millions of persons, they are all working. Therefore they are all working.

Even for a person like this, engaged in animal profession of life, only a few persons, selected persons, because the illusory energy has grasped under her clutches very tightly. To get out of the clutches is very difficult. So somehow or other, a few people, out of many millions and thousands, they come to the understanding of God. And then the rest of them, they are not able to understanding that what is the real perfection of life. Now, those who are actually perfected, out of them, out of millions of them, one can understand Kṛṣṇa. That is the statement of Bhagavad-gītā. Manuṣṭhānaṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānaṁ Siddhānaṁ means those who have already achieved perfection. Out of them. Not these imperfect fools. Those who are actually attained perfection, they can understand what Kṛṣṇa is actually. Tattva. And that actual position can be understood in another place of Bhagavad-gītā state, bhaktyā mām abhijānāti. What he sees actually, that can be understood by this devotional service. No other process. No other process will help to understand Kṛṣṇa. You can, by other processes, you can achieve some other thing. But if you want to know Kṛṣṇa, then you have to understand through your devotional service. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore Lord Caitanya instructed Sanātana Gosvāmī about Kṛṣṇa through devotional service."
**Summary:** This section discusses entering the spiritual kingdom through understanding Krishna via devotional service, highlighting Lord Caitanya's direct instruction to Sanatana Goswami.

So you will have entrance into the spiritual kingdom, into the abode of Kṛṣṇa, when you have perfectly… We cannot understand perfectly, but as far as possible, as far as you have got the capacity, if you understand Kṛṣṇa as He is, then the entrance will be there. Otherwise there is no entrance. Therefore Lord Caitanya instructed Sanātana Gosvāmī about Kṛṣṇa through devotional service. This instruction is very important. You should very carefully hear and, if possible, note. This is directly the instruction. Just like the Bhagavad-gītā, Lord Kṛṣṇa is directly instructing or doing. But in the Bhagavad-gītā there are many phases of instruction, fruitive action, philosophical speculation, and yoga system, and jñāna system, all kinds of different paths. Ultimately, of course, Lord Kṛṣṇa instructing him that sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ītaṁ sarvaṁ bhajaṁ. That is the most confidential part. But here Lord Caitanya, He is not instructing any superfluous thing.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Lord Caitanya's unparalleled mercy in directly offering the highest instruction of surrendering to Krishna, even more directly than Krishna himself did in the Bhagavad-gita.

So that is the blessing of Lord Caitanya. Even what Kṛṣṇa could not give, what Kṛṣṇa could not, or Kṛṣṇa hesitated to give, because Kṛṣṇa hesitated that if I speak in the beginning of the Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ītaṁ sarvaṁ bhajaṁ, people would not accept it. There was no necessity of describing Bhagavad-gītā in so many phases of instruction. Because the last instruction, most confidential instruction was that you give up everything and just surrender unto Him. That is the actual instruction of Bhagavad-gītā. But that was not spoken in the beginning. Because there are many phases of human being. They are under different stages of soul. Or they have different stages, karma, jñāna, yoga, so many things they have been discovered. Here Caitanya Mahāprabhu, His mercy is that He directly gives this highest instruction. What Kṛṣṇa could not give, but Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, or Kṛṣṇa in His incarnation as Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He gave up. Therefore He is considered the most munificent, charitable personality, man of charity. Rūpa Gosvāmī offered His respect that namo mahā-vadānā, you are the greatest munificent personality. You are directly offering Kṛṣṇa, which is very difficult for you. It is very difficult to understand. So many scholars, so many philosophers, so many great personalities, they could not understand Kṛṣṇa. But your mercy is so broad that you are directly offering Kṛṣṇa. Therefore mahā-vadānā, Kṛṣṇa prema-pradāya, directly you are giving love of Kṛṣṇa.

**Key Quote:** "So Sanātana Gosvāmī in this way directly received instruction from Lord Caitanya about bhakti-yoga, what is bhakti."
**Summary:** This section describes how Sanatana Goswami received direct instruction on bhakti-yoga from Lord Caitanya, emphasizing his humility and self-identification as belonging to the lowest caste due to his associations.

So Sanātana Gosvāmī in this way directly received instruction from Lord Caitanya about bhakti-yoga, what is bhakti. So this is called tattvaṁ sanātanāya īśa, kṛpayāpadi-veṣa īśa. īśa means the Lord, the Lord, Supreme Controller. So He is also there. Just like Arjuna received instruction directly, similarly Sanātana Gosvāmī also received instruction directly from the Supreme Lord. So here how to receive instruction, that is given by example by Sanātana Gosvāmī. tave sanātana-prahūr-carane dharīya dainya-vinati-kare dante-triṇalaiya Sanātana Gosvāmī very humbly fell down on the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And most humbly He submitted. What is that submission? nīca-jāti nīca-saṅgī-patīt adhaṁ pūpiṣaya pūpe parī gāyaṇu janam My dear sir, I have wasted my time in simply sensual gratification. That is my qualification. And I belong to the lowest caste. Nīca-jāti. Nīca-saṅgī. And my association is also of the lowest type. And patīt. I have fallen and I am the lowest of all. This is my qualification. Now, why He is submitting himself? Nīca-jāti. Nīca-jāti means those who are born in lower family. They are called nīca-jāti. They are śūdras or less than the śūdras. According to Vedic system, the brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya and vaiśya, they are higher caste. And the śūdras, they are lower caste. And less than śūdras, they are lowest.

**Key Quote:** "So in those days, amongst the brāhmaṇa community, if any brāhmaṇa would accept service, he becomes at once a śūdra."
**Summary:** This segment explains Sanatana Goswami's background as a brahmana who became ostracized for accepting service in a Muslim government, highlighting the strict social conditions of the time.

So Sanātana Gosvāmī, actually he belongs to the brāhmaṇa family. He, his forefathers belonged to the śārasya-brāhmaṇa family. There are different set, gaura-brāhmaṇa and śārasya-brāhmaṇa. So śārasya-brāhmaṇa, actually, they belong to the Aryan, āryavartā, the Panyāra side and Kashmir side. They are considered high-class brāhmaṇas. So he belongs to that community. But somehow or other, their forefathers… I mean, make their domicile in Bengal. Because they had some property in Bengal. They are very rich, aristocratic family. And this Sanātana Gosvāmī accepted ministership in the Mohammedan kingdom. So in those days, amongst the brāhmaṇa community, if any brāhmaṇa would accept service, he becomes at once a śūdra. He becomes at once. Because service is meant for the śūdras, not for the brāhmaṇas, kṣatriya and vaiśya. They would never accept anybody's obligation as service. They would starve. That was the principle. Only the śūdras could accept service. So because these Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rupa Gosvāmī accepted government office, although it was government office, but it was service, so they were outside the brāhmaṇa community.

**Key Quote:** "Everyone, unless he is conscious of his position that he is the lowest, he cannot become the highest."
**Summary:** This section emphasizes the importance of humility and recognizing one's fallen state due to engagement in sense gratification (eating, sleeping, mating, and defending) as a prerequisite for spiritual advancement.

Patīr, I have fallen. Ādhāṁ. And ādhāṁ means I am the lowest of the human beings. So, of course, because Sanātana Gosvāmī was under certain condition, it is not simply particularly for the Sanātana Gosvāmī. Everyone, unless he is conscious of his position that he is the lowest, he cannot become the highest. One should not think, while approaching his spiritual master, one should not be puffed up with his so-called qualifications. He should be a blank slate. That is the, that is requirement. He should forget that whatever nonsense he had learnt, he should forget. Otherwise, there will be no benefit by approaching spiritual master. He should forget. If he keeps his personality, I believe, I cannot, there is no necessity. With such nonsense things, nobody should approach a spiritual master. One should become a blank slate. So, I am fallen. I am the lowest. And I am lower born. So many things are good qualifications. This is my position. Nityānā. And ku viṣaya kupe parī gāiṇu-janaḥ. I have now wasted my time simply by sense gratification. Viṣaya means āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maitur. These are called viṣaya. Objects of sense gratification. Eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. These are called viṣaya. And we are engaged only how to eat very nicely, how to sleep very nicely, how to give me protection, and how to have nice mating. This is our business.

**Key Quote:** "Because I am so much fallen, because I have wasted my time in sense gratification...therefore my position is that I do not know what is actually beneficial to me."
**Summary:** This segment explores Sanatana Goswami's realization that despite his education and aristocratic associations, he doesn't know what is truly beneficial due to his wasted time in sense gratification.

So, Samātana Gosvāmī says that I have simply wasted my time in this way. And my position is this. So, therefore, actually, āpanār hita hi kisi na hi yati. Because I am so much fallen, because I have wasted my time in sense gratification, because I am ostracized, because my association is so lower, therefore my position is that I do not know what is actually beneficial to me. Āpanār hita hi kisi na yati. Now, Samātana Gosvāmī was minister, educated, he was learned scholar in Parsi and Sanskrit. So, how is it that he is placing himself in that way? Is he, I would say, imitating something, such humbleness? But actually he was known? Yes. Actually he was. No. Actually he was so. A devotee does not say anything falsely unless he feels. He feels himself like that. Why does he feel? He was educated. He belonged to the brāhmaṇa aristocratic family. His association was all Nabhāvas and Yamindārasa aristocratic family. And still he says like this. Why? What is the defect? That he felt like that. Now he is expressing. Āpanār hita hi kisi na yati. I do not know what is actually beneficial to me. I am thinking that if I am posted in a service like this, and if I have got some aristocratic association, I have got some enchantment for sense gratification, that is materialism. So I have passed my, wasted my time in that.

But actually I do not know what is beneficial to me. So grāma-bhāvahara paṇḍita tāi sattva-māne. In the Indian system, a brāhmaṇa is addressed as paṇḍita. But as you know, Paṇḍita Jahannālaya, although he had no brāhmaṇical qualification, but because he was born in a brāhmaṇa family, so this title was Paṇḍita. Paṇḍita. So a brāhmaṇa is addressed as paṇḍita. A kṣatriya is addressed as Ṭhākura. And a vaiśya is addressed as a saint, sīrjī, a rich man. The vaiśyas, vaiśyas are generally very rich men. For us, as you have in your country, the Rockefeller, Carnegie and Ford, similarly in our country you have got many rich men. Just like Billard, Dalmya, Bangar and so many. So they are called sēdjī. So sēdjī, Ṭhākura-jī and paṇḍita-jī. And the śūdras are called mahājana. Because if they are called śūdras, they will be angry. And mahājana means great personality.

**Key Quote:** "When you come to this culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they will be all in the same place."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how Krishna consciousness can unite people despite social classifications, contrasting it with the illusion of accepting false qualifications.

So these are some etiquette for addressing different communities. Among the different communities, although there are such classifications, still there was no enmity. They lived in village, although in their position, but the relationship was very friendly. Just like brothers, just like brothers, actually. Because the culture was religion. Culture was the Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So they depended on the culture. There was no provincialism. Because they depended on culture. The culture is the thing. The Kṛṣṇa conscious speech can… Even there are materially so many high and low classifications. When you come to this culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they will be all in the same place. So he said, the grāhma-bhābhāre paṇḍita. And as a matter of social etiquette, I am addressed as paṇḍita. Paṇḍita means planet. Planet scholar. He is called paṇḍita. Paṇḍita asama-darśana. He has read in the Bhagavad-gītā. Paṇḍita means he sees everything on equal eyes. Why? Because he is brāhmaṇa. He has known what is grāhma and what are these living entities. He has got such knowledge. That is called paṇḍita. So Sanātana Gosvāmī had no such knowledge. At least he is pretending like that. So he said, the grāhma-bhābhāre kahaye paṇḍita. By social etiquette, I am addressed as paṇḍita. But… And I also accept that I am paṇḍita. If somebody falsely calls me that your majesty… So it is an insult. It is not honoring him. I am an ordinary man. If somebody calls me your majesty… So a man who has no qualification… If he is visualized in that way, that is an insult. But we are so much poor that if somebody calls me your majesty, I shall feel, I am majesty. Yes? I am his majesty. That is our nature. If some false qualifications are awarded to me, I shall be very glad to accept it. I shall think, yes, I am. So Sarātana Gosvāmī said that actually I am not paṇḍita because I do not know what is my benefit, what is beneficial to me. I do not know the goal of my life. I simply wasted my time in sense gratification. I do not know. And still people say, you are paṇḍita. And I accept it. Just see my position. So this is blank slate, admitting that I am fool number one. But people say, I am learned and I accept it. This is our nature.

**Key Quote:** "So this mentality should be sacrificed first, before going to a spiritual master."
**Summary:** This section emphasizes the need to sacrifice pride and approach a spiritual master with humility and a blank slate, first understanding if the guru is qualified and then offering oneself as a student.

This is called illusion. He will never think that I am fool number one. He will always think, oh, who can be greater than me? I am the… I can think myself. What is the necessity of a spiritual master? I can… I can become a religious leader. I can become… This, this is our mentality. So this mentality should be sacrificed first, before going to a spiritual master. First of all, you have to select who can be your spiritual master. That requires some knowledge. Or you have to behave with a person to understand whether he is fit to be a spiritual master. If you become my spiritual master, then you should offer yourself to be a student. That is the process. Not that all of a sudden you shall go to a person, oh, please accept me as my student. No. You should first of all try to understand whether he is actually fit. Then offer yourself. So just like Sanātana Gosvāmī, when he first saw Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he did not offer himself. He just… But when he heard from Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he understood, yes, it is a very nice thing, so I should now retire from service, and I should wholly devote to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He left his very lucrative job, minister seat, and just like a very poor man, he approached to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And he… And he placing, submitting himself as blank place. That these are my qualifications. Please accept me.

Wherever you go within this material world, either in the Brahma-loka or in the Pātlā-loka, you have to die. That is the problem. So Hiraṇā Kaśipu wanted to solve this in a materialistic way, but that is not possible. So in a negative way, he wanted that I shall not die on the land, I shall not die in the air, I shall not die in the water, I shall not be killed by any man-made weapon. In so many ways, negatively, he thought that he has become immortal. But Kṛṣṇa is so intelligent that, keeping all the words or the blessings given by Lord Brahmā to Hiraṇā Kaśipu, He cannot kill anyone. So we cannot cheat God. That is not possible. However scientifically we may be advanced, God is always more intelligent than ourselves. We should always remember.

Emmanuel. So sometimes Arjuna is accused, Bhagavad-gītā is also accused that there is violence. Bhagavad-gītā is full of violence. Yes, it is full of violence, the war field, but here the Vaiṣṇava thinking, Arjuna is thinking that it was arranged for his love, rājya-sukha, yad rājya-sukha-lobhī, loving. It was arranged for the satisfaction of Arjuna so that he could enjoy the kingdom and the happiness thereof. Actually it was not so.

**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes devotional service from ordinary work, emphasizing Krishna's mission to protect the good and vanquish the wicked.

Yes. So that is the difference between ordinary work and devotional service. Devotional service and ordinary work, they look almost equal. Just like we are living in this house, the neighbors, they may think that something is wrong. Some people are living here, chanting, dancing. We also dance. We also sometimes sing and eating. They are also eating. So what is the difference? They may think that what is the difference between devotional service and ordinary work? It looks almost equal. Therefore people misunderstand that Bhagavad-gītā is ordinary warfare, violence. But it is not that. It is arranged by Kṛṣṇa because to fulfill His mission, His mission is paritrāṇāṁ sādhunāṁ vināśāya ca dṛśkṛtām.

**Key Quote:** "So kinsman does not mean, in higher sense, only my brother or my sister or my father or my uncle. Sa janam means all living entities because one who hasn't got Kṛṣṇa consciousness, ordinary consciousness, material consciousness, he cannot think in terms of sa janam, my kinsmen, all living entities. He cannot think."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the real purpose of religious life is to establish Krishna consciousness, and kinsmen means all living entities.

That is His satisfaction, not Arjuna's satisfaction, not anyone's satisfaction. It is His plan. He comes, He descends on this planet, in this universe, just to establish the real purpose of religious life and to kill, to vanquish those who are opposing the real purpose. That is His mission. Simultaneously, two things: paritrāṇāṁ sādhunāṁ vināśāya ca dṛśkṛtām. So sa janam ahavato mahat-pāpam kartam bhavuṣitābhayaṁ yad rājya-sukha-levana hantam sa janam urdatam sa janam means kinsman. So kinsman does not mean, in higher sense, only my brother or my sister or my father or my uncle. No. Sa janam means all living entities because one who hasn't got Kṛṣṇa consciousness,

Actually, everyone is our sa janam because if God is father, as Kṛṣṇa claims, ahaṁ vīja-pradapitāḥ, if He is the Supreme Father, not only He claims, at least any fine religious system claims God is the original Father. That's the fact. ahaṁ sarvasya prabhava matta-sarvaṁ prabhartate. Everything has come from Him. He is the Supreme Father. If Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Father, He is father of everyone. sarva-joni-sukha-antaya. In all species of life, in all forms of life, they are all our sa janam, kinsmen. How it cannot be? Because Kṛṣṇa is the original Father. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa does not want to commit a little harm to any living entity. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Yukta-cuse

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna loves everyone equally and a Krishna conscious devotee also sees everyone equally.

도 Do you want to move to a state where KṛṣṇaUfar is not real in the sense of pieces which we have seen in our lives? In the sense of worldview I mean. Well, that's true, true. I mean, you can move about your little yard. In your little yard. Oh my, that is true. That's true, true. That's true, true. also. Cows also. Samadarsana. For Krishna, the gopi is the calf and the cows or anyone in Vṛndāvana who has come to serve him, they are all equal to him. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as calf. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as cow. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as gopi. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as cowherd boy. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as his father. Somebody wants to serve Krishna as his mother. These are the different mellows, different tastes. Every living entity has got his own taste, how to love Krishna. But the central point is to love Krishna. Krishna also reciprocates. He has no discrimination that here is gopi, beautiful girl, therefore I shall love her more than the calf. No. Krishna is not so partial. Similarly, Krishna's devotees also, because he has Krishna consciousness means he has got now a minute quantity, Krishna's quality. Therefore, he is also equal to everyone. He thinks everyone sajana.

**Key Quote:** "The living part, the soul is the same dimension either within the ant or in the elephant."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the dimension of the soul and explains that a pundit sees the soul in everyone, regardless of their external form.

The same member of the same family. It does not matter if one has become ant or one has become elephant. The living part, the soul is the same dimension either within the ant or in the elephant. This dimension of the soul we have several times discussed. One ten thousand part of the top of the hair. keśāgra śatavāgasya śatadhā kalpitasyaca jīva-bhāga-sabhījña sa anantāya kalpate. There is the dimension. In śāstra we get the dimension of the soul. Very, very minute. One ten thousand part of the top of the hair, just a minute. So that portion is within the ant and within brahmā and within elephant. Therefore, one who is pundit, one who knows what are these soul spiritual parts, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, if he has got full knowledge, then his vision is vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe govi hastini śunite ca sapāke ca paṇḍitāḥ samadarsana. Samadarsana means equal vision. A learned brāhmaṇa is most intelligent man in the human society. And a dog superficially, externally, there is much difference. Here is a dog, a street dog, and here is a learned brāhmaṇa. But one who is pundit, one who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he sees that the pundit and the dog, they are the same, because they are also the same spiritual part. By his karma, he has become a learned pundit. And by his karma, he has become a dog.

**Key Quote:** "If we want to kill any living entity, for my satisfaction, either my tongue satisfaction or any sense satisfaction, it is mahāpāpaṁ great sinful act."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that killing any living entity for one's own satisfaction is a great sin.

But within the different body, dehi na smin jathā dehi kaumār, smin dehe, in this body, there is the soul. That is his vision. Of course, externally it is not that I shall behave equally with the brāhmaṇa and the dog. That is external behavior. But internally we should know that both the brāhmaṇa and the dog, they are spiritual parts. This is called brahma-jñāna. Brahma-jñāna means the knowledge of spiritual self. That is called brahma-jñāna. So when one attains this brahma-jñāna, then brahma-bhūta-prasannātmā na śocati na kānta samas sarveṣu bhūteṣu samatā equal. That is brahma-jñāna. So in this verse, Arjuna says that yad rājya sukha-lobhena hantuṁ śva-janam pūrdhataḥ. So when we are killing animals for the satisfaction of our tongue, this is mahāpātaḥ. Arjuna says ahavatau mahat-pāpaṁ mahat-pāpaṁ great sinful act. If we want to kill anyone, any living entity, for my satisfaction, either my tongue satisfaction or any sense satisfaction, it is mahāpāpaṁ great sinful act.

**Summary:** The speaker laments that people kill for sense gratification, even in the name of religion, and questions how they can be happy.

Because they are all śva-jana. You cannot kill. Either you take this sense or that sense. But Arjuna is speaking in a limited sense. He is thinking of his own family members. But if one is actually in knowledge, brahma-jñāna, he thinks in the same way that the lower animals, they are also our family members. And if I kill him for my satisfaction, my sense satisfaction, it is great sinful act. Unfortunately, everyone is killing for his sense satisfaction, gratification, in the name of religion. In the name of religion, and although it is prohibited, still they are killing. Thus, imagine how much sinful activity they are doing and how they can be happy. Happiness, of course, a hawk also thinks that he is very happy, that he is eating stool, living in filthy place, and because he has got the facility of sex life without any discrimination, he may think happy life. But that is not happiness.

**Summary:** The speaker defines real happiness as being beyond material senses and achieved through purified senses employed for Krishna's sake.

Happiness is different thing. sukhaṁ ātyam tṛtaṁ yatraṁ atindriya grāhyam. If you want to feel happiness by your, this blunt material senses, that is not happiness. Happiness is beyond your material senses. ātyam tṛtaṁ. That is real happiness. Real happiness means it will never end. And you will never feel satiation. There is no more want. That is real happiness. Material happiness, there is no such thing. That you will feel immediately satiation. After enjoying any material happiness, a few minutes, you will feel again another, again another, again another. So, therefore, in the Bhagavad-gītā it is said, sukhaṁ ātyam tṛtaṁ yatraṁ. So, real joy, what is real happiness, that is not felt by these blunt material senses. What is that sense? That is purified senses. sarva-pādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratyena nirvana. When our senses are purified, tat-paratyena, for the sake of Kṛṣṇa, when our senses are employed for the sake of Kṛṣṇa, that is purified senses. hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam bhakti-rīcchate.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts acting for one's own sense gratification with acting for Krishna's satisfaction, stating that the latter leads to spiritual advancement.

That is wanted. So, here, in the beginning, Arjuna is thinking in terms of his blunt senses. But the same thing he will do. He will do. ātyam tṛtaṁ atindriyaḥ purified senses. Just try to understand. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Arjuna is now thinking yad rājya-sukha-lobhena. For the matter of getting kingdom and sense gratification, I am going to kill my kinsmen. So it is great sin. That's a fact. If the warfare, in the Kurukṣetra battlefield, was for Arjuna's sense satisfaction, then it was a great sin. But actually it is not being done for Arjuna's satisfaction. It is to be done for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction. So therefore the conclusion should be that whatever we do, if we do it for our own sense satisfaction, that is mahāpā, sinful activities. But if we do the same thing for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction, that is spiritual advancement. This is the

**Summary:** The speaker explains that perfection of life is achieved by acting for the satisfaction of Krishna according to one's prescribed duties within the varnasrama system.

difference. You have to change, the consciousness, what you are doing, for whom you are doing, for yourself or for Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And that is the perfection of life. In whatever position you are, whatever you are doing, it doesn't matter. That is confirmed in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. adapyaṁ vīdīyaśreṣṭa-varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ sānuṣṭhitaśya-dharmanāṁ saṁsiddhī-haritauśanaṁ haritauśanaṁ means to satisfy the Supreme Lord. That is perfection. It doesn't matter what you are doing. varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaṁ. First of all, whatever doing, it does not mean whatever nonsense you are doing. That will be accepted. No. varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaṁ. God is the one who makes you happy. So that's the definition of varṇāśrama. According to Vedic civilization, there is division of varṇa. Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūrya. So activities must be done according to the varṇāśrama prescription. A brāhmaṇa is ordered to do like this: Satyamādhama titikṣhā, aryava. So that is, therefore, it is called varnāsana. The prescribed duties are already there. Therefore perfect human society means, first of all, there must be this division: Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya. And when they act the duties of that particular position, brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, that is perfection of life. It doesn't matter whether you are a śūdra or you are brāhmaṇa, but if you act for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa according to the prescription of your position, then your life is perfect. That is wanted.

**Key Quote:** "Although superficially it appears that Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna to fight in the sinful activities. No. That is not sinful. Whatever Kṛṣṇa does, it is not sinful. It is transcendental. The most pure activity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that human civilization should be based on the principle of satisfying Krishna, and that Kṛṣṇa's actions are transcendental and not sinful.

The whole human civilization should be based on this principle. There must be division. The division is already there. They should be coordinated. Systematized. Not that everyone is brāhmaṇa. Brāhmaṇa means the intelligent man. So we should pick up the intelligent man. They should be trained as brāhmaṇa. Those who are martial, having fighting spirit, they should be selected as kṣatriya. Those who are for increasing money, mercantile mentality, they should be also collected. Similarly, śūdras. And they should be trained, everyone, to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. Varnāsamo vibhāgasaḥ sānuṣṭitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhiḥ hṛtośaḥ. So here Arjuna is a fighter. He is engaged in fighting. Now he is thinking that is proper. He is Vaiṣṇava. He is devotee. He is properly thinking that for my sense gratification, I am going to kill my kingdom. What a great sinful activity I am going to do. But actually Kṛṣṇa is not engaging His devotee to act sinfully. No. That is not Kṛṣṇa's business. Although superficially it appears that Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna to fight in the sinful activities. No. That is not sinful. Whatever Kṛṣṇa does, it is not sinful. It is transcendental. The most pure activity. Therefore one, the rascals who do not understand Kṛṣṇa, they say that Kṛṣṇa is immoral.

**Summary:** The speaker defends Kṛṣṇa's actions against accusations of immorality, using the analogy of the sun purifying even impure things.

They do not know what is Kṛṣṇa and what is Kṛṣṇa's action. They do not know. They think, now Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna to fight, it is immoral. Why Kṛṣṇa should engage Arjuna in the fighting business? So therefore, or why Kṛṣṇa is engaged in dancing with the gopīs, their wives and sisters of other men? It is sinful. If we enjoy with other's wife or other's daughter or other's sister, who is not bona fide my wife, if I want to enjoy life, that illicit sex. Kṛṣṇa is not doing that. But artificially, those who are nonsense, they say that Kṛṣṇa is dancing at dead of night with other's daughters and girls. Therefore He is immoral. But that means He does not know what is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa can do anything. Tejiya-sāṅga-nadośāya. He, just like the sun, is very powerful. As we see in this material world, the sun, a material thing, and it is very powerful. But the sun is soaking water, taking water from the sea as well as from filthy place. See, He is also taking, what is called soaking? Evaporating, yes. Evaporating water from urine also. And fill the place where ditches. He is evaporating water as well as from the sea. But it does not mean by evaporating water from the sweat, ditch and urine, the sun is becoming polluted. No. Rather He is turning that place, what is called, prophylactic, antiseptic, by His sun sign. Similarly, even though somebody comes to Kṛṣṇa with some purpose which is not moral, but the man or woman who comes there, he becomes, he or she becomes purified.

**Summary:** The speaker criticizes those who misunderstand Kṛṣṇa and His activities, particularly the rāsa dance, and emphasizes that it should not be discussed among fools.

And Kṛṣṇa does not become immoral. This science has to be known by the rascals before calling Kṛṣṇa immoral. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā, manuṣyānāṁ śāśay su kaścid yatati siddhaya, yatatāṁ api siddhānāṁ kaścid vetti mām tattvaḥ. These rascals, they do not know what is Kṛṣṇa. They think Kṛṣṇa is ordinary man. Why He is engaging Arjuna in the fighting? Why He is dancing with others, daughter and girls? These are immoral things. Therefore this rāsa dance should not be discussed among the fools and rascals. They misunderstand. Although the professional reciters, they take part. Whenever they speak of bhāgavata, they easily jump over this rāsa dance. That is not to be done. Caitanya Mahāprabhu never indulged in such thing. For months of April, He engaged Himself in saṅkīrtana. And when Kṛṣṇa's dealing with the gopīs were discussed, He was discussing amongst three selected devotees: Rāmānanda Raya, Śarūpa Dāmodara and Śikī Mahīta. He had thousands and thousands of devotees. But He never discussed Kṛṣṇa's rāśrīla in the mass of people, never. That word is restricted.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Kṛṣṇa is not immoral and is not engaging Arjuna in sinful activities, and that the difference between lust and love is whether one is satisfying their own senses or Kṛṣṇa's.

Kṛṣṇa, because they will misunderstand. These rascals, they do not know what is Kṛṣṇa, and they will misunderstand. They will be polluted. Of course not polluted, because they, after all, they will hear about Kṛṣṇa. But they may misunderstand. That is against their making progress through the spiritual life. So Kṛṣṇa is not immoral. Kṛṣṇa is not engaging Arjuna to commit such sinful activities, sajanaṁ hatyā. No. Kṛṣṇa is engaging him in His service. So one has to understand that. So when Arjuna will understand that this war, this fighting, is not for my sense gratification, it is for Kṛṣṇa's sense gratification, then he agrees, because he is a devotee. Kariseva-canantaḥ. Yes, I shall now act. This is the proposition. The ātma-indriya-tṛpti-vañca-dhare tārṇāṁ kāmaḥ. Kāma means lust. What is lust? Lust means whenever you try to satisfy your senses, that is called lust. And the same, whenever you try to satisfy Kṛṣṇa's senses, that is love. Practically the same business, but personal and Kṛṣṇa's. So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we have to act everything for Kṛṣṇa under proper direction.

We cannot manufacture that I am doing for Kṛṣṇa. Then there is another misleading. Therefore we require the guidance of the spiritual master. Kṛṣṇa, guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya. That is caitanya-caitāmṛta. You have to seek the mercy both of Kṛṣṇa and guru. Not that you have become so advanced that you are directly in connection with Kṛṣṇa and whatever you are doing it is mercy. No, don't think like that. It must be guided, it must be confirmed by guru. Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya-pāya-bhakti-latā-vīr. Bhakti line is there. So our business is, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that we have to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. That reference by that professor Zenner, that one robe, he did by his whims and he alleged that after reading Bhagavad-gītā violence he committed this violence. So did he take permission from Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's representative? But he does not know the technique. He has unnecessarily accused, committed a great offense to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. So therefore an inexperienced person, they should not try to teach Bhagavad-gītā to others because he has no knowledge. This knowledge has to be received by paramparā system, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam evaṁ rāja-śaya-vidu.

**Summary:** The speaker warns against hearing about Kṛṣṇa from non-devotees, as it can lead to misunderstanding, and reiterates that Kṛṣṇa engages Arjuna to serve His purpose.

So simply by academic career, by knowledge of ABCD, you cannot understand Bhagavad-gītā. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said, bhaktosī priyosī, without becoming bhakti. Therefore Sanātana Gosvāmī has proven that don't hear anything about Kṛṣṇa from a person who is not a Vaiṣṇava. Ā Vaiṣṇava mukha-gīnā pūta hari-kathā mṛtam śrava-naṁ na katham. This is private. You cannot hear. Because this audience of the students, they also do not know that here is a rascal, he is not a devotee. He is not a Vaiṣṇava. Why should we hear from him Bhagavad-gītā? The first condition is bhaktosī. And the prohibition is also by ācāryas. Ā Vaiṣṇava mukha-gīnā pūta hari-kathā mṛtam śrava-naṁ na katham. Pūta hari-kathā mṛtam. Hari-kathā, talks of Kṛṣṇa, they are by themselves pure. But still it is prohibited that if it is spoken by a ā Vaiṣṇava, non-devotee, one should not hear, should not hear. Must immediately reject. First of all we have to see who is going to speak about Kṛṣṇa. Is he a devotee of Kṛṣṇa? Is he a Vaiṣṇava or not? If he is not, then immediately reject. Oh, we are not going to hear from him. But people do not know. Any rascal speaking about Bhagavad-gītā, we hear. That is not the process. Then we will misunderstand. Ā Vaiṣṇava mukha-gīnā. Śarpa-kṣiṣṭa-paryoja-tā. Just like milk is very good food, everyone knows. But when it is touched by the tongue of the serpent, it is positive, immediately. So we cannot drink poison. Don't hear Bhagavad-gītā or any talk about Kṛṣṇa from a person who is not a Vaiṣṇava, who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. We will misunderstand. Just like what they will say. Then we will say, oh, Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna for fighting, for committing so many sinful activities. No, that is not the fact. Kṛṣṇa is engaging Arjuna, fighting, to fighting, just to serve His purpose. Paritrāṇāya sādhunāṁ vināśāya ca duṣṭhṛtaḥ.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada reads and translates Bhagavad Gita verse 1.43, emphasizing the consequences of destroying family traditions.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 1, Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, Verse number 43: Utsanna kula-dharmāṇāṁ manuṣyāṇāṁ janārdana narake niyatam vāso bhavatīty anuśuśruma. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: O Krishna, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell. Purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: Arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience but on what he has heard from the authorities; that is the way of receiving real knowledge. One cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without being helped by the right person, one who is already established in that knowledge. There is a system in the varnasrama institution by which one has to undergo the process of ablation before death for his sinful activities. One who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of ablation, called the Prayaschitta. Without doing so, one surely will be transferred to the left path. One who is engaged in sinful activities will not be transferred to the right path. One who has been engaged in sinful activities should be transferred to hellish planets in order to undergo a miserable life as a result of sinful activities. This is Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada's purport. O Krishna, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell.

This is meant for the human being, Manuśyāna, not for the animals. So unless the human society accepts that, these principles of varnasana-dharma, ordained by Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, is not considered amongst the human beings, they are as good as animals, because there is no regular, systematic principles.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada introduces the concept of Sadhya-Sadhana (goal and means) and mentions Caitanya Mahaprabhu's inquiry about the aim of life.

of how to live as a human being. Therefore in the Viṣṇu Purāṇa, when Caitanya Mahāprabhu was talking with Rāmānanda Rāya, so Caitanya Mahāprabhu inquired, what is the actual aim of life? Sādhya-sādhana. Sādhya and sādhana. What is the aim? Sādhya means what for this human form of life we have got. That is called sādhya, the goal, the goal of life. And sādhana. Sādhana means the activity by which we can attain, we can achieve that goal of life. This is called sādhya-sādhana. The Darwin theory, although they are given some idea of progressive evolution, but he does not know what is the goal of life, why this progress is there. That these rascals, they do not know.

**Key Quote:** "Why this living entity is wandering, not fixed up? So there must be some goal. He is hankering after that. There must be some goal of life."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada critiques Darwin's theory, emphasizing the lack of understanding of the goal of life and the transmigration of the soul.

Taking some hints from the Padma Purāṇa, Brahma Vaibhata Purāṇa: Asyadeṁ saturāṁ caiva jīva-jātiṣu. Lakkhāṁ stāṁ jīva-jātiṣu. There are 8,400,000 types of jīva-jāti. Asyadeṁ saturāṁ caiva lakkhāṁ stāṁ jīva-jātiṣu. This is already there. Brahmadvī. In this way, the living entity is wandering in the cycle of transmigration of the soul. So from this, Mr. Darwin might have taken some hints, but he could not explain properly. He could not catch up that Brahmadvī, who is wandering. So it is a chaos. So anyway, why this living entity is wandering, not fixed up? So there must be some goal. He is hankering after that. There must be some goal of life. To achieve that goal of life, that is called śādhya. Why we are struggling here? For happiness or something else, we are struggling. So this question was raised by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. What is the goal of life? Unless there is goal of life, why is there struggle? Why is there? There must be some goal of life, śādhya. And śādhana. śādhana means the means by which we can achieve that goal of life. That is called śādhana.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada contrasts modern opinions with Vedic principles, highlighting Caitanya Mahaprabhu's humility when questioned about his practices.

So Rāmānanda Raya quoted, because when there is talk between two learned persons, they, just like nowadays, it has become a fashion, in my opinion, I think in this way. What nonsense? Why you can think? What is your knowledge? But he is very proud. Everyone writes that. The other day, Sir Alistair, Alistair Hardy came. He also said, it is my opinion. Nobody thinks that he is a nonsense number one. What is the value of his opinion? Nobody thinks. But this is the Vedic principle. Even Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when he was asked by Prakāśananda Sarasvati, that you are a sannyāsī, you do not engage yourself in the study of Vedānta. You are simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. So, because sannyāsī is supposed to be always reading Vedānta philosophy especially and all other philosophies. So what is this that you are chanting? Like a sentimental person. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied,

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes the importance of humility, citing Caitanya Mahaprabhu's example and verses from Caitanya Caritamrita about considering oneself lower than a worm in stool.

yes, my Guru Mahārāja, spiritual master, saw me a fool number one. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu, it was known to Prakāśananda Sarasvati was a great learned scholar in his student life. So he is posing himself as a fool number one. So, this is the way, Caitanya Caitāmṛta, the author of Caitanya Caitāmṛta, he is presenting himself as, puriṣer ki thaita muhiṣe logiṣṭa, I am lower than the worm of the stool. Puriṣer ki thaita muhiṣe logiṣṭa, logiṣṭa means lower. Lowest. Jagai madhāi haite muhiṣe pāpiṣṭa. Jagai madhāi was taken. They are drunkards, woman-hunters, therefore they are sinful. So Caitanya Caitāmṛta, the author, says that jagai madhāi haite muhiṣe pāpiṣṭa. Although, this is the way, nobody thinks himself as, one has become very big man, and he has his own opinion to give. This is rascala. Everyone should think that, I am a pig, what is my value? That is really large.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada continues to stress humility, stating that one should always consider oneself a fool and avoid giving personal opinions without authoritative support, referencing Arjuna's example.

Humble and meek. Nobody should think that, now I have learnt everything. I can surpass everyone. I have become above all rules and regulations. Now I have become paramāṁśa. This is rascala. Everyone should always think as a fool number one. Therefore, they never will go on to become perfect. If we think that, now I have become perfect, paramāṁśa, then the spiritual regulatory principles will never be followed, and he will fall down. So, here Arjuna also says, nara ke niyataṁ vāsa bhavati iti anuśuṣyumaḥ Krishna, I have heard it from authoritative sense. He never says, Krishna, in my opinion, if it is done like that, then people will go to hell. He does not give his own opinion. He says, iti das anuśuṣyumaḥ abhā. This is called paramāṁśa-siṣṭha. Nobody should give his own opinion. He must quote the authoritative statement to support his proposition.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that the aim of life is to satisfy Krishna, drawing an analogy to citizens satisfying their government.

So similarly, when Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, what is the aim of life? And how to achieve it? So Rāmānanda Rāya, he did not give his own opinion. That in my opinion, like this. Here also, Arjuna says, iti anuśuṣyumaḥ I have heard it. Heard it means, suṣyumaḥ means heard from authority. So Rāmānanda Rāya said, that, the real purpose of life, goal of life, is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of God. Just like, as we are citizens, what is our duty? We want to satisfy the authority, the government. When one serves the government nicely, in this country, he is recognized as knight, he is recognized as Earl, as Lord, as, so many, they have got titles. Every country, when a person is a very exalted citizen, then he is recognized by the God. So if this is the system in our ordinary life, then, the aim of life should be to satisfy the supreme governor or supreme God.

It is very common sense. But they have no supreme God. They think, whatever government we make, that is fine. No. There are so many kingdoms, so many planets. In each planet, there is government, there is authority, and above all of them, there is the supreme authority, Krishna, Isvara Parama Krishna, Svacchidananda Vidra. This is the Shastric Indian. There are many controllers. In this planet, there is controller. There is another planet, another planet. Even Brahma is the controller of the whole universe. Just like in our government, there is system. One department, several departments is being managed by another director. Several directors are being managed by another secretary. And the same system. Krishna is the supreme proprietor. Sarva Loka Maheswara. And he has got many secretary's assistants. They are called Brahma. So Brahma means the manager of one Brahma universe.

And you can see also the sky is round. This is the wall of this universe. So anyway so as we are here in this small government our business is to satisfy the government. You publicly suppose the queen is a prostitute. Then what will be? Immediately will be arrested and punished. In your private house you can say nobody will hear. But if you say such thing nonsense in public that is your aim of good citizens. What is the difference between good citizens and outlaws?

destroyed. They have no family. They don't care about what is destroyed. No family life. No taking bath. No what say nothing at all. Irresponsible. I've seen it in Amsterdam. What is that part? Horrible. Exactly. This this what now happening. Utsarna, all destroyed, finished. Kula-dharmana, no family life. Therefore, for human being, it is the duty to understand his position, and it is his duty to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vishnu. This is the whole plan. Therefore, Ramananda Raya quoted the verse from Vishnu Purana: The varnasrama-carvatam purujena para-pramana. Vishnu-aradhati. Because the aim is to satisfy Vishnu, to become Vaisnava. To become Brahmana is also to satisfy the lower status. You will hear from the Caitanya-caritamrta that our Madhavendra Puri, he was installing deities. So there are many Brahmanas, caste Brahmana born in. So in order to give charge of worship to those Brahmanas, he initiated them to become Vaisnavas.

**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that Vishnu accepts offerings based on love and bhakti, emphasizing that a Vaishnava leads a regulated life aimed at satisfying Vishnu.

Because without becoming Vaisnava, nobody has got right to worship Vishnu. Vishnu will not accept anything from anyone unless he is devotee. And Vishnu is poverty-stricken that he has come to take from you. He cannot eat. He has no eating means. No, he can't. Why? He agrees to accept our offering just on the basis of love. The Vaishnava loves Vishnu and Vishnu agrees to accept any foodstuff. That bhakti is main thing, not your palatable dish. Vishnu is quite competent to prepare thousand times better palatable dishes than you can offer. But the real thing is bhakti. So Vishnu Aradhana means, that should be the aim of human life. Vishnu Aradhana means one must become a Vaishnava. And Vaishnava means regulated life. Not destroy everything, finish, to become hoax. That is not Vaishnava. Vaishnava means regulated life. Aim to how to satisfy Vishnu.

So whole Vedic scheme is there. How to satisfy Vishnu? Therefore it is said, the ussanya-kula-dharmanam manasranam. In the human life, if they do not follow the regulative principles of family life, family tradition and systematic arrangement of four division of the society, Brahman, Kshatriya, Bhakti. In this way, we can satisfy the Supreme Lord. Our aim is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. And this can be done perfectly, if we follow the regulative principles of jati-dharma, kula-dharma. Jati-dharma means, if you are born in the family of a Brahmana, you have got particular duties. Simply, you have to engage in this. duties. Simply if you think yourself that I am in, I am born in a Brahman family, my duty is all finished. Now I can do whatever nonsense. They think like that. I have spoken. They are very much proud of taking birth in Brahmana family. So when others are engaged in devotional service, they say, oh, you are born in lower family. You have got to do this. We are born in Brahmana family. We have nothing to do. But they do not know that jati-dharma-kula-grhana, utsanna-kula-dharmana. If you are actually Brahmana, you must keep your family tradition.

Otherwise, if you sacrifice everything of your family tradition, just like in your country, the lower family, the lower family is maintained.

Or if they spoil, then no one cares for them. Then their house will be sold and they will be still bigger. No more Lord family. So everywhere, you take politically or socially or spiritually. For human beings, if you want to make your life successful, then you must keep the tradition of Brahmana-kula-dharmana. So our, we are Visnava. Our only tradition is how to satisfy Visnava. That is the tradition of everyone. But especially our Visnava. They must be very alert, very careful how to keep Lord Visnava, Krsna satisfied. That is our only business. You should not neglect it.

Then you will spoil everything. When you have invited Visnava, Krsna, Ekanya, Mahaprabhu to accept your service, you must be very, very careful how to render service. How cleanly, how nicely you have to serve. Otherwise everything will be spoiled. utsanna-kula-dharmana. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy. Visnava's kula-dharma is simply to satisfy, Krsna. So in the manuṣana, actually human life begins, when he's ready to serve the Supreme Lord, Visnu. That is human life. Otherwise they are never like that. Therefore, the whole world is in chaos. They are not eager to have Visnu. are simply eager to serve their senses. Godas, servant of the senses. So instead of becoming servant of the senses, you have to become master of the senses. That is called gosvam. If you remain servant of the senses, then you are godas. Kamadinankati dhanakati. That is animal life. And when you become master of the senses, how is it possible? Master of the senses. Now, if you employ your senses always in the service of Krsna, your senses

If you have this vow that I shall not allow my tongue to eat anything except prasadam, it is already controlled. Gosvam. That means to control the senses means to engage the senses in the service of the Lord. This is control. Otherwise, by force, just like the yogis, they try artificially. By some force, they try artificially. But some gymnastics. That may be possible for some time. But if it is, there are many instances, it becomes impossible. Because by force, you cannot control the senses. That is not possible. You must give better and just better. If I force, you think that I shall control my tongue, I shall control my eyes, I shall control my eyes, or I shall control my belly. Artificial. But maybe possible. But sometimes. But they are so strong. The senses are so strong. Artificially, it can have this power. Param drstasyam. Stated in the Bhagavad-gita. That is, give the senses better engagement. Then you can control. Risi-kena risi-kesa sevana-dvaha sarva-pādipi-nenmukta-tattva-tena. You have to purify the senses. How? By engaging the senses in the sarva-paratvena. In fact, then you will be able to purify the senses. And purified senses, when you are engaged in the service of the Supreme, that is called bhakti. So if we are actually human beings, manushyana, pulo-dharma, this family tradition is not meant for the cats and dogs. If you live life, cats, no question of family tradition. But if you live one life, you will be able to purify the senses. That is called bhakti.

Risi-kena risi-kesa sevana-dvaha sarva-pādipi-nenmukta-tena.

As we have got, four divisions in the Mahākārīya, Vaisya, Śūdra must be there. And each one should serve according to his guṇa, karma, quality and capacity to work. Yes. it is organized, position will be perfect, there will be peace, no war, nothing on the side, and gradually making progress back to conduct, otherwise it will become at the present moment.

**Key Quote:** "Kṛṣṇa will fulfill your material desires and at the end will give shelter at His lotus feet."
**Summary:** Worshipping Krsna fulfills material desires and ultimately leads to shelter at His lotus feet, unlike worshipping demigods which provides temporary and finite benefits.

People generally go to temples and churches for mitigating some material wants. Even if you have material desires, still you take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa will fulfill your material desires and at the end will give shelter at His lotus feet. This is the advantage of devotion and service. Whereas if you worship other demigods, you may get some temporary benefit, but at the end the benefit will be finished, you will be finished, and the demigod who has given you the benediction, he will also be finished. But even if one has got some material desires to be fulfilled, if he worships Kṛṣṇa, those desires will be fulfilled. At the same time, he will get shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord.

Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramatma, or the centralized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagawan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krishna. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus: vadanti tattva vidas tattvam yajnana madhvayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavaneti shabdhyate. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagawan. These three Divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun's surface, and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student; one who understands the sun's surface is further advanced; and one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine, its universal pervasiveness, and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramatma feature of the Absolute Truth, and the student who can enter into the heart of the Sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists, who have realized the Bhagawan feature of the Absolute Truth are the topmost transcendentalists. Although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter, the sunshine, the sun disc, and the inner affairs of the Sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category. The Sanskrit word Bhagawan is explained by the great authority Parashara Muni, the father of Vyasa Deva: the Supreme personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge, and all renunciation is called Bhagawan. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Krishna can claim this because he is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahma, Lord Shiva, or Narayana, can possess as fully as Krishna. Therefore, it is concluded in the Brahma Samhita by Lord Brahma himself that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagawan, known as Govinda, and he is the supreme cause of all causes. There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagawan, but Krishna is the Supreme because none can excel him. He is the Supreme person, and his body is eternal, full of knowledge, and Bliss. He is the Primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes. In the Bhagavatam also, there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Krishna is described as the original Personality of Godhead from whom many, many incarnations and personalities of Godhead expand. Krishna is the one who is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss; he is the Supreme personality whom many incarnations and personalities of Godhead expand. इंद्राहारी व्याकुलम लोकम रदयन्ति युगे युगे All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Therefore, Krishna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the Impersonal Brahman. In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna's lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Krishna expressed His surprise with the word, कुतस, wherefrom? Such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Aryans. The word Aryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is really to achieve the goal of life. They are led by the realization of the Absolute Truth, Vishnu or Bhagavan, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Aryans. Although Arjuna was a Kshatriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-Aryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the program, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord Krishna did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.

#### Bhagavan, Krishna, Vyasadeva, Authority of Scripture, Mayavadi philosophy

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada emphasizes Krishna's supreme position as Bhagavan, refuting claims of equality and highlighting the authority of Vyasadeva as an incarnation of Narayana, while criticizing Mayavadi philosophers.

The Supreme Person, Bhagavan, said, "My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy." So, in this verse, Bayas Dev is writing, of course, the speaking is through, but the original writer is Bayas Dev, for in other shlokas he writes Arjuna Uvaj, Sanjaya Uvaj, like that. Similarly, he could write here Krishna Uvaj. He could write, no, he is writing Bhagavān Uvaj. So, Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By this writing, it is established, see Bhagavān Uvaj. He cannot be equal with Arjuna or Sanjaya or anybody else. He cannot be equal with Arjuna or Sanjaya or anybody else. 심्थ मूर्थ. भगवां ह्रमां। दु अध्यम् पर्स्णेज् हु गर्ण तामा कूब्य। दु अध्यम् पर्णिया भागत गार्णाम। पर्णिया। वह रही है। धर्जठ को ब्लबेयार वही ने डाल रहा था, दुअरे उजदौर ट्रू unrelated to BSVмार. Nobody is equal to him. Nobody is higher than him. Everyone is lower. That is the meaning of Bhagavān. Nobody can claim, "I am Bhagavān." But nowadays there are so many rascals. They are claiming that everyone is Bhagavān. But Vyāsadeva is mistaken. Actually, these Māyāvādī philosophers, they are so great rascals, they sometimes say like that, that Vyāsadeva is also mistaken. They have got the audacity to say, Vyāsadeva is accepted as incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, who has given us the Vedic literature. So many books he has given: The Vedas, the Puranas, Mahābhārata, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Vedānta-Śūtra. Everything is given by Vyāsadeva in writing, and he is accepted, Nārāyaṇa, incarnation of Nārāyaṇa.

#### Disciple Succession, Perfect Knowledge, Four Defects, Cheating, Bhagavad-gita

**Key Quote:** "Vyāsadeva is writing śrī-bhagavān vāca where there is no cheating, no imperfection, no illusion, no mistake."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses the importance of disciplic succession for receiving perfect knowledge, contrasting it with the four defects of those in the material world: mistakes, illusion, imperfect senses, and cheating, and emphasizing the perfection of Bhagavad-gita due to its divine source.

There cannot be any mistake in the words of Vyāsadeva. This is the difficulty, if one does not come through the channel of disciple succession. So there, in so many ways, mistaken. Vyāsadeva is above all this. He is not an ordinary writer for material description, for material name and place. He cannot be mistaken, as Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa cannot be mistaken. Similarly, Vyāsadeva, incarnation of Bhagavān, he also cannot be mistaken. Neither devotee of Kṛṣṇa can be mistaken. Devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he does not say anything as his own opinion. He never says what Kṛṣṇa says. He says he may be not perfect, but what Kṛṣṇa has said, that is perfect. Therefore, a pure devotee who does not say anything beyond which was spoken by Kṛṣṇa, therefore his statement is also without mistake. Common man within this material world, he commits mistake. To any human, even big, big personality, they commit mistake, but Nārāyaṇa para, he is transcendental. Kṛṣṇa is transcendental. There cannot be any mistake. There cannot be any illusion. Those who are within this material world, they have got four defects. They commit mistake, they are illusioned, and their senses are imperfect, Brahmapramādvī, and they are cheaters. Because just like modern day scientists and philosophers, they propagate so many branches of knowledge, but when on the question of knowledge, the crucial point, they are caught. They say, "I do not know perfect. I do not know perfect. We are trying to know. In future we shall tell you the perfect." But if you are not in perfect knowledge, why should you take the post of a teacher? If your knowledge is imperfect, then whatever you speak, that is imperfect. Therefore, with this knowledge, therefore with imperfect knowledge, why you should become a teacher? That is cheating. Therefore, purposefully Vyāsadeva is writing śrī-bhagavān vāca, where there is no cheating, no imperfection, no illusion, no mistake. Four things: no mistake, no illusion, no cheating, and no imperfection.

#### Vedic Process, Parampara System, Disciplic Succession, Spiritual Master, Order of Guru

**Key Quote:** "The only qualification is that I have tried to execute the order of superior authority, this is the secret of success."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains the Vedic process of receiving perfect knowledge through disciplic succession and emphasizes that becoming a spiritual master requires following the order of a superior authority, rather than personal qualification.

Why you are taking Bhagavad-gītā so seriously? There are so many other books we can read, so many theories, so many philosophers, big, big philosophers, but we cannot take them because they are defective. The author, the author is sure to commit mistake, he is illusioned because his senses are not perfect, therefore imperfection. So with all these defects, we cannot accept anyone's knowledge. This is Vedic process. This is called paramparā system, disciplic succession. We receive knowledge perfectly from the supreme bhagavān, and if I receive the knowledge from bhagavān, and if I distribute the same knowledge as bhagavān has said without any interpretation of my cheating policy, then the knowledge which I distribute, that is also perfect. I may not be perfect, but the knowledge which I have taken from Kṛṣṇa, if I present it as it is without any interpretation, then what I give you, that is perfect. It is very easy to understand. I have given several times, just like a peon has brought a money order for you, thousand dollars. I have given a thousand dollars for you. I have given a thousand dollars just like a peon has brought a money order for you, thousand dollars just like a peon has brought a money order for you, thousand dollars, so he is giving you. So you cannot say, "Here is a peon, he is a poor man, how he can give me one thousand dollars?" He is not giving, the money is sent by somebody else, he is simply handing it over. Therefore, Caitanya Mahāprabhu says āmā rāgdhāya guruhaiyā tāraḥ sarva-deśaḥ tāraḥ sarva-deśaḥ. He is asking everyone to become a spiritual master. So how everyone can become spiritual master? A spiritual master have sufficient knowledge and so many other qualification. No, even without any qualification one can become spiritual master. How? The process is Caitanya Mahāprabhu says āmā rāgdhāya guruhaiyā tāraḥ sarva-deśaḥ tāraḥ sarva-deśaḥ. No, even without any qualification one can become spiritual master. How? On my order. That is the crucial point. One does not become spiritual master by his own wings. That is not spiritual master. He must be ordered by superior authority, then he is spiritual. āmā rāgdhāya, just like in our case, our superior authority, our spiritual master, he ordered me that you just try to preach this gospel, whatever you have learned from me in English. That I have tried to execute the order of superior authority, that's all. The only qualification is that I have tried to execute the order of superior authority. This is the secret of success.

#### Sannyasi, Krishna Consciousness, Bhagavan, Impersonalism, Absolute Truth
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/e3SxWTcHSKk?t=1386
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "भगवान means person. भगवान is not imperson."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada defines a true sannyasi as one who works for Krishna without attachment to results, emphasizes that Bhagavan is personal, not impersonal, and explains the three features of the Absolute Truth.

He is actual sannyāśī. सन्यासी does not become simply by changing dress. नौ सन्याशी means he is to work for कृष्णा without taking shelter of the result. It doesn't matter. कृष्णा has order and कृष्णा's representative has order. Therefore I have to do it. कार्यं कर्म करोगे. सा सन्याशी. So here, भगवान वाज. वैस्तिम् दोस्तों नहीं कहते है कि कृष्णा वाज. If you would have said कृष्णा, then people would have misunderstood. He is directly speaking भगवान वाज, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So anyone who is impersonalist, how he can understand भगवाद गीता? भगवान means person. भगवान is not imperson. The absolute truth is manifested in three features: ब्रह्म, परमात्मा, भगवान. ब्रह्म is the beginning, impersonal. सर्वमिदं खुलू ब्रह्मा because just like fire, fire is burning somewhere, but its heat and light is impersonal. Suppose here is big fire, just like we got fire place, that is in one corner, where the whole room you are feeling heat. That heat, that heat, that heat is impersonal, but the fire place where there is blazing fire, that is personal. So impersonal conception is the offshoot of the person. That will be explained in the 13th chapter. मया ततमिदं सर्वम। कृष्णा से That everyone, everywhere I am spread. I exist everywhere. How does he exist? By his energy. That energy is impersonal, but the Supreme Person, he is not impersonal. He is personal.

**Key Quote:** "Full understanding is Bhagavān. Therefore it is stated here, śrī-bhagavān vāca. There cannot be any mistake that is final."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada explains that Bhagavan is the ultimate understanding of the Absolute Truth, criticizing Arjuna's material compassion and contrasting it with the spiritual perspective.

Therefore it is said, स्री भगवान दधार्च। भगवान means who is full with six kinds of appearance. अईशत जब। विशार्चाँ। विशार्चाँ। Richest, the most famous, the most learned, the most beautiful, the most strong, and the most renouncing, he is Bhagavān. So Bhagavān is the ultimate understanding of the Absolute Truth. Just like when you feel temperature, just like we feel temperature from the sunshine, heat, and light. The sun is giving heat and light. Everyone can enjoy the light and heat, but if you trace where from this heat and light is coming, then you go to the sun planet. That is localized. That is not important. And again, if you enter into the sun planet, then you will see the sun gone. We were shunned. So we should not conclude final simply by heat and light. So Brahmā understanding, impersonal understanding of the Absolute Truth is imperfect understanding, partial understanding. It is not full understanding. Full understanding is Bhagavān. Therefore it is stated here, śrī-bhagavān vāca. There cannot be any mistake, that is final. So Bhagavān is criticizing. Arjuna became very good man. Why is he like this? I cannot kill my kinsmen. From material point of view, people will very much appeaset. He is Arjuna, he is so nice, Don't Fourth. He is purgohing. He's claiming. He has gimla. He is asâtrā daa, bow and arrows by legs, lips, teeth. He is no longer fighting. He has decided not to fight with his kinsmen. He has decided not to kill his own man. So from

#### Killing vs. Non-killing, Progress of Life, Higher Planetary Systems, Miscreants, Hateful Habits, Aryan vs. Non-Aryan

**Key Quote:** "So, आर्ज्य means must make progress. अनार्ज्य means one who does not know what is progress of life."
**Summary:** Srila Prabhupada discusses the balance between killing and non-killing in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing the importance of making progress in life and contrasting Aryan and non-Aryan values.

but if a tiger comes to attack you, you must kill, that is self-defense and that is not himself. So a devotee knows, a Krishna conscious person knows when to kill and when not to kill, but it is not that because we accept not killing, therefore in every case killing should be stopped. No. If there is necessity, killing should be accepted. Therefore Arjuna decided not to kill, not to fight, and Krishna says that this is anārya-duṣṭam, this kind of decision is made by the uncivilized rasa. Anārya-duṣṭam. Asargaṁ. Akhirti-karam. So many things. Asargaṁ. Because the aim of human life should be to make progress. That is called Arjuna. Progressing, marching. Now we have got this human form and knowledge. Progressing from the lowest species of life in aquatic, then trees, plants, insects, birds, beasts. Eight million four hundred thousand. Now I have got this civilized form of body. Then my endeavour should be how to make further progress. This further progress is described in the Bhagavad-gītā. That you can go to the higher planetary system. पुर्णंग च्छंति सत्तस्वाः। पुर्णंग च्छंति सत्तस्वाः। Higher planetary system. मद्दे ते संति राशवाः। मद्दे ते संति राशवाः। मद्दे संति राशवाः. In the middle planetary system. Those who are contaminated with the passion quality, they remain without it. जघन्न गुणवित्तिष्ट अधोवच्छंति नामेशाओ। And those who are miscreant, जघन्न गुणवित्तिष्ट, most hatefully accustomed. This is hatefully accustomed: illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling, intoxication. These are habits of hateful nature. अब जघन्न गुणवित्तिष्ट नामेशाओ। जघन्न गुणवित्तिष्ट अधोवच्छंति नामेशाओ। अधोवच्छंति नामेशाओ. They go down. They become animals of the same kinds of lower planetary system. तर अतर नितर पाठार तर अतर रसातर लेकिन. So, आर्ज्य means must make progress. अनार्ज्य means one who does not know what is progress of life. They think there is no life after death. So, I have got this life now. Let me enjoy my senses to the best capacity.

**Key Quote:** "So, in this video, let us get to the bottom of this."
**Summary:** The video introduces the debate surrounding the Rithvik system of initiation in ISKCON and the May 28th GBC meeting as a crucial piece of evidence.

We have been hearing from the supporters of the unauthorized self-appointed Guru system in ISKCON that the Rithvik system was temporary and they also say that Srila Prabhupada said, disciple of my disciple, grand disciple, he becomes regular Guru. These kind of words are loosely bandied about. So, they quote these. Words like disciple of my disciple, grand disciple and these kind of things. And say that because of these words from Srila Prabhupada, Rithvik system is not bona fide. That Prabhupada's disciples are authorized to be Gurus by Prabhupada. So, in this video, let us get to the bottom of this. The most crucial pieces of information. The most crucial pieces of evidence for the Rithvik system of initiations in ISKCON are two in number. Number one, the May 28th, 1977 GBC meeting with Srila Prabhupada. And number two, the July 9th, 1977 directive. So, these words, disciple of my disciple, grand disciple, he becomes regular Guru. These are all taken out of the. May 28th meeting. So, out of these two important pieces of evidence, the May 28th conversation and the July 9th directive. Let us first take up the May 28 GBC meeting.

**Key Quote:** "Tamalkrishna Goswami knew that nobody in ISKCON was qualified to become Guru. And Srila Prabhupada also confirmed his statement."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights a conversation from April 1977 where Tamal Krishna Goswami and Srila Prabhupada discuss the lack of qualified gurus in ISKCON.

So, before we dive into that meeting, let us first understand why this meeting assumes importance and what relevance it has today. When Srila Prabhupada is not physically with us anymore. Because Prabhupada, there are many, many recordings of Prabhupada's conversations. So, what is special about this conversation? To understand this, we have to go back in history to the year 1977. Now, first, let us hear one revealing conversation between Tamal Krishna Goswami and Srila Prabhupada. This conversation took place on 22nd. 22nd. 22nd of April, 1977. People complained again also. Did you know that? I am not sure of the particular incidences, but I have heard generally. In Germany. In Germany. The devotees there. I am coming. That is where we met. The devotees offered me their condolences. Why is 지는 Goodbye. Get well. He followed up. He is the guide here. Therefore, change is good. Therefore, change is social. You know that? I heard that, yes. You are producing some lessons here. Well, I have studied myself and all of your disciples and I... It's clear fact that we are all conditioned souls, so we cannot be glued. Maybe one day it may be possible, not now. Yes. I can do it. Now I am doing. I can say, now I will become a father, you become a father. I am waiting for you. You become all I want. I retire, complete. The train must be complete. So, you heard that from Srila Prabhupada's lotus lips. In April, of 1977, barely seven months before Srila Prabhupada departed from this planet, Tamalkrishna Goswami knew that nobody in ISKCON was qualified to become Guru. And Srila Prabhupada also confirmed his statement.

**Key Quote:** "The key principle here is that to become guru, one must be ordered by one's guru."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that a true guru must be ordered by their own guru, contrasting this with unauthorized or 'rubber-stamped' gurus.

So, let us hear what went on further in the conversation. The process of purification has begun. In the present times, you may have to throw everything away, but in the future, now I will tell you that He did not do that yet. He did not do that. So I have to tell you, He gave me money. He has told me, If you want to become a guru, come. Come to the life of God. You see, we are Gaurīmās. Everyone wants to become guru. And in small temple you have guru. That's all. No obligation, no preaching, simply brings a foodstuff, my Guru Mahārāj, joint mess, place for eating, our ātya khana, joint mess. Exactly. So we see here. Śrīla Prabhupāda emphasized that a rubber-stamped guru won't be effective. The key principle here is that to become guru, one must be ordered by one's guru. In other words, any person ordered by his guru to become guru is authorized. And any person who is not ordered by his guru, but he becomes guru, some or the other. Either by himself or somebody else tells him, or there is a body of some people who give him a no objection to become a guru, some or the other, he becomes guru, then he is not bona fide, he is rubber-stamped or unauthorized guru.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada said, it is better to plan for the worst. And he called all the GBCs to come to Vrindavan."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Srila Prabhupada's declining health in May 1977 and his decision to call the GBC members to Vrindavan.

Now, let us move on in history to the month of May in the same year, 1977. This month means that one has to take the terms of Jayasabila and Chandrasurga for every business Day of Ram. What had happened was, by May of 1977, Śrīla Prabhupāda's health had deteriorated considerably. Therefore, devotees had decided to shift Śrīla Prabhupāda to a more salubrious place, so that Śrīla Prabhupāda could recover from his limp念. So, they chose H capsule ministry. H capsule ministry in Uttarakhand? H capsule ministry in Uttarakhand? was the place which was chosen for Srila Prabhupada to recuperate. On the 7th of May in 1977, Srila Prabhupada left for Rishikesh by a night train. Overnight, they travelled from Delhi to Rishikesh. And there in Rishikesh, they had taken a place on rent and some few devotees and Prabhupada was staying there. While they were staying there, on the 14th of May, in the night, there was a fierce thunderstorm. There was a power cut. It was pitch black in the night and there was lightning, thunder and strong winds were blowing the whole night. Devotees were all shaken up. The next day, on May 15th, Srila Prabhupada called the devotees and instructed them, to make his will. So now, this was a clear indication that Srila Prabhupada had decided to leave the material world. Now, the very next day after that, on the 16th of May, Srila Prabhupada again called the devotees. At 2.30 am, Prabhupada was sitting up straight on his bed and he said, if I am going to die, then let it be in Vrindavan. Now, it was more clear what Srila Prabhupada had decided. So, the devotees immediately started making arrangements and maybe they could not arrange train tickets at such a short notice or for whatever reason, they got a car to take Srila Prabhupada to Vrindavan. So the same day, Srila Prabhupada was taken to Delhi by car. And there is Delhi in the evening. They stayed in Delhi for the night. And again in the morning, the next day, May 17th, they left from Delhi by car and went to Vrindavan. And in this way, Prabhupada reached Vrindavan on the 17th of May, 1977. There many of you who would have visited the Krishnabalram temple in the guest house, there is Prabhupada's quarters. And Prabhupada was staying there. Five days after reaching Vrindavan on the 22nd of May, Srila Prabhupada said, it is better to plan for the worst. And he called all the GBCs to come to Vrindavan. So based on this order of Prabhupada on 22nd of May, by May 28th, most of the GBC members had reached Vrindavan.

**Key Quote:** "So we can see that all the five questions that were prepared by the GBC in that meeting on 28 May were all for the time after Srila Prabhupada left."
**Summary:** The speaker outlines the five questions the GBC members prepared for Srila Prabhupada, all concerning the period after his departure.

And they held a meeting in Vrindavan. At that time in ISKCON, there were 23 GBC members. But only 18 were able to make it to Vrindavan for the meeting. After due deliberations in the meeting, the GBC chose five questions that they wanted answers from Srila Prabhupada for the time after his departure. So the 18 GBC members were present there. Noted down the five questions. they wanted to ask Srila Prabhupada. What were those questions? The questions were, number one, how long should GBC members remain in office? Number two, how can GBC members who leave be replaced? So actually, you see, these two questions are relevant only in Prabhupada's disappearance. Because as long as Prabhupada was there, the GBC members were continuing and whoever was leaving, Prabhupada was replacing them. So this question was coming up because in future, when Prabhupada is not there, how will they do it? Question number three, in the absence of Srila Prabhupada, what is the procedure for first, second and sannyas initiations? Question number four, what is the relationship of the person who gives this initiation to the person he gives it to? And question number five, the last question, is there any provision for publication of other translations of Vaishnava scriptures by the BBT after the departure of Srila Prabhupada? So we can see that all the five questions that were prepared by the GBC in that meeting on 28 May were all for the time after Srila Prabhupada left.

**Key Quote:** "Even the question on how initiations were to be conducted in ISKCON were also for the future, when Prabhupada was not there with us."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the GBC's questions, including the one about initiations, were specifically for the time after Srila Prabhupada's physical presence.

Shaila Prabhupada's departure. Until May of 1977, Shaila Prabhupada appointed the GBCs. So, they wanted to know after Prabhupada's departure, how the GBCs would be appointed. Similarly, the other questions are also valid, especially for the time after Prabhupada's disappearance. Even the question on how initiations were to be conducted in ISKCON were also for the future, when Prabhupada was not there with us. Initiations had already been going on in ISKCON for 11 years, from 1966 till 1977. So, what was the need to ask how it would be conducted, unless it was for the time when Shaila Prabhupada was appointed? Shaila Prabhupada had departed when he was no longer with us. Otherwise, this question has no meaning. So, coming back to the meeting, the 18 GBC members then chose 7 senior-most devotees amongst them. These devotees were the ones who had been part of the original 12 GBC members chosen by Shaila Prabhupada in 1970. When the direction of management was formulated, which is how the GBC was born. So, these 7 members were to take these 5 questions to Shaila Prabhupada. In effect, the GBC meeting for these 5 questions was chaired by Shaila Prabhupada himself. Now, let us listen to the recording of this meeting between the 7 GBC members and Shaila Prabhupada. Where these 5 questions were put to Shaila Prabhupada. So, we will listen to that portion of the meeting, which is relevant to questions 3 and 4, which are related to initiations in ISKCON. Question number 3. In the absence of Shaila Prabhupada, what is the procedure for first, second and sannyas initiations? This was question 3. And what was question 4? What is the procedure to initiate, what is the relationship of the person, who gives this initiation to the person, he gives it to? This is the fourth question. A little bit of complicated, convoluted question, but nevertheless, these are the two questions that we will be focusing upon and here is

Then what is the relationship of that person who gives the initiation and the… He's guru. He's guru. But he does it on your behalf. Yes. That is formality.

Yes, they are disciples. I consider. Who? No, he's asking that these Hrithik acharyas, they're officiating, giving diksha. They're the people who they give diksha to, whose disciple are they? They're his disciples. They're his disciples. Who is initiated, his grand disciple, you see. Yes. Then we have a question. When I order you become guru, he becomes regular guru. That's all.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "However, let us try to understand the meeting proceedings a little better."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to analyze the conversation, focusing on the claims made by supporters of self-authorized gurus based on Srila Prabhupada's statements.

He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. Now that you have heard this portion of the conversation, the supporters of the self-authorized gurus use the last portion of this meeting, especially the portion where Srila Prabhupada says he is his disciple, he is grand disciple, to claim that Srila Prabhupada appointed them as gurus. However, let us try to understand the meeting proceedings a little better. However, let us take one question at a time. If you all recollect, there were two questions, question number three and question number four. So, let us take one question at a time and see what Srila Prabhupada's reply to it was. Question number three, we will take this up first. What was question number three? Satsvarupa, by the votes of the present GBC. Then, our next question concerns initiations in the future. Particularly, at that time, when you are no longer with us, we want to know how first and second initiation would be conducted. This was question number three, put forth by Satsvarupa Das. Prabhupada responded, yes, I shall recommend some of you. After this is settled up, I shall recommend some of you to act as officiating. Are you ready? This was Prabhupada's immediate response. And Tamalkrishna responded to that. Is that called Rithvik Acharya? And Prabhupada said, Rithvik, yes. Prabhupada actually corrected him. Tamalkrishna Goswami said, Rithvik Acharya. Prabhupada said, no, it is Rithvik. Rithvik, yes. So, with this, the response to question three ended. It is very obvious. And clear, that Shaila Prabhupada's response was crystal clear. And there was no doubt about Prabhupada's response in the minds of the GBC present. So, question three and its response, very clear, no ambiguity. Immediately after this, Satsvarupa Das and Tamalkrishna went on to the next question. So, it is as clear as daylight that Shaila Prabhupada was going to appoint him. He was going to appoint officiating Acharyas or Rithviks, not Diksha Gurus.

**Key Quote:** "If Shaila Prabhupada wanted them to become Gurus, he could have said that he is going to recommend some of them to act as Diksha Gurus or Gurus."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that Srila Prabhupada's intention was to appoint officiating Acharyas or Rithviks, not Diksha Gurus, and that the July 9th directive is not a temporary arrangement.

If Shaila Prabhupada wanted them to become Gurus, he could have said that he is going to recommend some of them to act as Diksha Gurus or Gurus. But no. The moment the question was put to Shaila Prabhupada, how initiations will be conducted in the future, particularly at that time, When Prabhupada is no longer with us, Shaila Prabhupada, without hesitating for a moment, or waiting to think, or considering different options, should we do like this, or should we have this system, or we have that system, there was no such consideration. Prabhupada immediately responded with officiating Acharyas. A clear, straight question and a clear, straight answer. And we all know that Shaila Prabhupada did choose eleven people to act as Rithvik, representative of the Acharya, which, in other words, is officiating Acharya. And when did Shaila Prabhupada do this? He did this in the July 9th, 1977 directive. Hence, the July 9th directive appointing Rithviks is not a temporary arrangement, but it is meant for the time, particularly when Shaila Prabhupada is appointed. It is not a temporary arrangement. But it is meant for the time, particularly when Shaila Prabhupada is appointed. It is meant for the time, particularly when Shaila Prabhupada is appointed.

**Key Quote:** "Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to analyze the fourth question, noting its convoluted nature and splitting Srila Prabhupada's reply into two parts.

So, Question 3 and its response, very clear. There was no doubt in the minds of Tamalkrishna or Satsarupadas. Now, we come to Question 4. This question, as we saw earlier, is framed in a little convoluted manner. They could have asked a clear and straight question. Whose disciple are those who are getting initiated? Instead, they came up with this. Satsarupadas started, reading out the fourth question. Then, what is the relationship of that person who gives the initiation and the he came to only that much, Prabhupada interrupted him. So, this was a complicated question. And, naturally, complicated question will get a complicated reply. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. In the first part, Shaila Prabhupada gives the principle. The same principle which he mentioned in the April 22nd meeting with Tamalkrishna Goswami, which we have gone through already. So, this April 22nd meeting discussion with Tamalkrishna Goswami happened just about a month before this May 28th meeting. In that meeting, in that discussion, as well as here, Shaila Prabhupada quoted Amar Ajnayi verse and stressed on the fact that without order of the predecessor Guru, no one can become Guru. This is an inviolable principle. So, now, let us see what is Prabhupada's response to Satswaroop Dasa's question. Prabhupada, he is Guru. He is Guru, Satswaroop. But he does it on your behalf. Prabhupada, yes, that is formality. Because in my presence, one should not become Guru. So, on my behalf, on my order, Amar Ajnayi Guru Haya. Be actually Guru, but by my order. So, here, we can clearly see that Prabhupada is reiterating the same principle which he discussed in the April 22nd meeting. April 22nd discussion between Prabhupada and Tamalkrishna Goswami.

#### Guru's order, Initiation, Rithvik, Disciple

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Without one's Guru's order, no one can become Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the principle that no one can become a guru without the order of their own guru, as stated by Srila Prabhupada.

Without one's Guru's order, no one can become Guru. Shaila Prabhupada was stating this principle. Another point to note here is that Satswaroop Dasa wanted to ask what is the relationship between the Rithvik and the devotee who is getting initiated. But instead, he ended up asking, what is the relationship between the person who gives initiation and the disciple? Actually, in Shaila Prabhupada's mind, it is clear that there are two people. One who gives initiation, which is Shaila Prabhupada, and the other one who officiates, which is the Rithvik. So, when Satswaroop Dasa asked what is the relationship of the person who gives initiation, and the disciple, Shaila Prabhupada immediately said that he is Guru. What does that mean? The person who is giving initiation, the initiator is the Guru. And the officiator is the Rithvik. Initiator is Shaila Prabhupada and he is Guru. It is very clear, abundantly clear. Now, in the second part of this session, of this conversation, of this reply, Satswaroop Dasa and Tamalkrishna Goswami wanted to clearly know if the disciples are theirs or Shaila Prabhupada's. So, the first part of the reply did not yield the response they were looking for. So, they wanted to see if they can eke out something which they were looking for. Because, in the first part of this reply, Prabhupada only spoke about the principle, Amarajnaya Guruhaya and all that. So, Satswaroop Dasa wanted to clarify. So, Satswaroop, so they may also be considered your disciples. Prabhupada, yes, they are disciples. Why consider who? Tamalkrishna intervened. No, he is asking that these Rithvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving Diksha. There, the people who they give Diksha to, whose disciple are they? So, you have to understand this question by Tamalkrishna Goswami. Here, Tamalkrishna Goswami sensed the difference in understanding between Satswaroop Dasa and Shaila Prabhupada. When Satswaroop Dasa asked, what is the relationship of the person who gives initiation, he was referring to the officiator, the Rithvik. But Prabhupada, he referred to the initiator, which was himself. So, Tamalkrishna Goswami understood. And he intervened with the clarification that they were asking about the Rithvik, not the one who gives initiation.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada. They are his disciple."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the conversation further, highlighting Tamalkrishna Goswami's intervention to clarify the question about the disciples of the Rithvik Acharyas.

And then, to that, Shaila Prabhupada replied as follows, Prabhupada, they are his disciple. Tamalkrishna, they are his disciple. Prabhupada, who is initiating? He is grand disciple. Satswaroop, yes. Tamalkrishna, that's clear. Satswaroop, immediately, he is going to the next question. Then, we have a question concerning, Prabhupada has still not completed. He intervenes. When I order you become Guru, he becomes regular Guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. Now, this appears a little confusing. The moment Shaila Prabhupada said, they are his disciple, Tamalkrishna Goswami and Satswaroop Das felt that the response that they had wanted to hear has now come. They wanted to close the reply and go to the next question. Looks like they were not aware that Shaila Prabhupada had not finished his reply and they ended up interrupting Prabhupada. So, if we remove the interruptions, which are simply repetitions of whatever Prabhupada said, they are his disciple, they are his disciple. Then, Shaila Prabhupada's reply looks like this. Tamalkrishna, no. He is asking that these Rithvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving Diksha. There, the people who they give Diksha to, whose disciple are they? Prabhupada. They are his disciple. Who is initiating? He is grand disciple. When I order, you become Guru. He becomes regular Guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it.

#### Initiating, Grand Disciple, Guru, Disciple

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When I order you become Guru, he becomes regular Guru."
**Summary:** The speaker interprets Srila Prabhupada's response, suggesting that the disciples belong to the initiator (Srila Prabhupada) and that one only becomes a regular guru when ordered by Srila Prabhupada.

So, when we remove the interruptions, the conversation looks like this. Now, in the last part, one option of Shaila Prabhupada's reply is, who is initiating? He is grand disciple. But the phrase, who is initiating? He is grand disciple, doesn't make any sense at all. I am initiating someone. How do I become my own grand disciple? It doesn't make sense. So, what is the other option? The other option is, that it must be, they are his disciple who is initiating. Now, this option, they are his disciple who is initiating, makes perfect sense and is completely in sync with what Shaila Prabhupada said earlier, that the disciples are his. He is the initiator and whoever is initiating, the disciples belong to him. There are two people here. One is the initiator. The other is the officiator. Shaila Prabhupada is the initiator and Tamalkrishna Goswami, Satsarup Das and others were going to become the officiators. So, whose disciple are they? They are the disciples of the initiator who is giving the initiation, which is Shaila Prabhupada. So then, the conversation looks like this. Let us take a look at it in light of this. Tamalkrishna, now, he is asking that these Ritvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving Diksha. There, the people who they give Diksha to, whose disciple are they? Prabhupada. They are his disciple who is initiating. He is grand disciple. When I order you become Guru, he becomes regular Guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. Now, the conversation is beginning to make sense. This means, Prabhupada goes on to clarify that only when he orders someone to become Guru, saying you become Guru, then only he becomes Guru and the question of disciple of Prabhupada's disciple arises. Prabhupada is again stating the same principle, Amarajnaya, which Prabhupada spoke in the first half of the reply, which we have already seen. So, now, the entire thing makes perfect sense. Otherwise, you see, a few seconds earlier, when Satsarupadas asked, so, they may also be considered your disciples. When Satsarupadas asked this, what was Srila Prabhupada's reply? Srila Prabhupada replied, yes, they are disciples. Why consider? To think that Srila Prabhupada first said that the disciples are his and then changed it to disciple of his disciple in a matter of few seconds does not make sense at all. However, when we see that Srila Prabhupada is stressing that the disciples are his and that they can become their disciple only when he orders, it becomes crystal clear that Srila Prabhupada is consistent throughout the discussion.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that Srila Prabhupada did not order anyone to become a disciple of a disciple or to become a guru, emphasizing the consistency of Srila Prabhupada's statements.

Now that we have understood the real meaning of this conversation, let us go through it once again, beginning with question 3. Satsarupa, then our next question concerns initiations in the future, particularly at that time when you are no longer with us. We want to know how first and second initiation will be conducted. Prabhupada, yes, I shall recommend some of you. After this is settled up, I shall recommend some of you to act as officiating Acharyas. Tamalkrishna, is that called Rithvik Acharya? Prabhupada, Rithvik, yes. So, here the reply to question 3 ended. So, Prabhupada is going to appoint a Rithvik. Appoint only Rithviks, not Diksha Gurus. Then Satsarupa starts with question number 4. Satsarupa, then what is the relationship between the person who gives the initiation and the... So, he said, who gives the initiation. He did not say who officiates. So, because he used the word initiation, Prabhupada replied, he is Guru. He is Guru. Meaning, the person who gives the initiation, which is Prabhupada, is the Guru. But Satsarupa has misunderstood. He is thinking the person who is giving initiation is the Rithvik. So, he says, but he does it on your behalf. So, Prabhupada understands that he is now referring to the officiator, the Rithvik. So, Prabhupada says, yes, that is formality because in my presence one should not become Guru. So, on my behalf, on my order, Amar Adnyai Guruhaya, be actually Guru but by my order. So, Prabhupada is stating two principles here. One is, in Prabhupada's presence one should not become Guru. So, anyway, he cannot become Guru. And another principle is, Amar Adnyai Guruhaya, you can become Guru but only against Prabhupada's order. Satswarupa, so they may also be considered your disciples. Prabhupada, yes, they are disciples. Why consider who? So, Prabhupada still has not changed this stance that there is an officiator who will represent Prabhupada and Prabhupada will give diksha and the disciples will be his. So, he is saying, yes, they are disciples. Why consider who? So, Tamalkrishna understood now. Okay, Satswarupa has got confused. So, he, jumped in, clarifying. No, he is asking that these Ritvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving diksha. They are the people who they give diksha to. Whose disciple are they? Prabhupada. They are his disciple who is initiating. So, you see, Prabhupada is throughout consistently saying the person who is initiating which is Prabhupada, the disciples belong to him. That means disciples belong to Prabhupada. He is grand disciple. When I order, you become guru. He becomes regular guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. So, again, Prabhupada stated the principle. Don't expect that they will become your disciples. When I order you become guru, then you become regular guru. At that time, he will become disciple of my disciple. So, we can see here clearly that when we look at the conversation of the disciples, they are completely free from any sort of confusion. So, now, there is no confusion. It is very clear Prabhupada did not order anyone to become disciple of disciple or to become guru.

#### Rithviks, Diksha Gurus, GBC minutes, Srila Prabhupada's signature

**Key Quote:** "It is irrefutable that Srila Prabhupada appointed gurus or diksha gurus or acharyas. He only appointed officiating acharyas or rithwiks."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that even if there was confusion in the reply to question 4, the reply to question 3 was clear: they would be rithwiks, not diksha gurus, and that Srila Prabhupada's signature was essential on the minutes.

Anyway, hypothetically speaking, for the sake of argument, let us say that Srila Prabhupada's reply to question 4 was not clear. Whether the disciples belong to Srila Prabhupada or they become disciples, it is not clear. So, no matter whatever the lack of clarity in the reply to question 4, the reply to question 3, there was never any doubt. It was crystal clear and it was accepted to be so by all the GBC members present there. What was that? That they would be rithwiks and not diksha gurus. None of them had any question. So, it is irrefutable that Srila Prabhupada appointed gurus or diksha gurus or acharyas. He only appointed officiating acharyas or rithwiks. Now, the hypothetical confusion is with regard to only question 4. And what is that question 4? The question 4 is what is the relationship between the rithwik and the person getting diksha or initiation. This is where confusion hypothetically is. It is shown that there is no confusion. Even if such confusion is there, all such confusion was completely cleared by Srila Prabhupada when he chose the first 11 rithwiks through his directive on July 9, 1977. In that directive, Srila Prabhupada not only appointed 11 rithwiks but he also made it amply clear there what is the relationship between the rithwik and the disciple. So, that confusion about the relationship between the rithwik and the disciple was also cleared by Srila Prabhupada on July 9. So, what remains? However, despite the so-called confusion in the response to question 4, here is what the rithwik recorded. Srila Prabhupada said he will appoint several devotees who shall perform initiation in the future even after his disappearance. The disciples they accept shall be their disciples and Srila Prabhupada will be their grand spiritual master. Actually, this is not what Prabhupada said. Anyway, this is what they recorded in the minutes book. The seven members came back and whatever they said got entered into the minutes book. And all the 18 members present there signed the minutes. But, they did not take Srila Prabhupada's signature on the minutes. That was a grave omission. After all, all the devotees in all fairness, in an ideal case, Srila Prabhupada's signature was essential on the minutes. But, they did not take it. Devotees, in fact, did try to take Srila Prabhupada's signature on that minutes. But, see for yourself what happened. This is what happened. He states, Jyadvaita Maharaj did say strongly that I had better get this in writing from Srila Prabhupada. He said this was very important and that it was really not clear. He said that unless it was in writing, it would be contested by devotees later. I was not clear to me. But, Jyadvaita Maharaj insisted that I get it in writing from Prabhupada.

#### Tamalkrishna Goswami, GBC minutes, July 9, 1977 Directive, Rittviks, Gurus

**Key Quote:** "Tamalkrishna Goswami stalled, obstructed the demand to get Srila Prabhupada's signature on the GBC minutes."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Tamalkrishna Goswami prevented Srila Prabhupada from signing the GBC minutes and emphasizes that the July 9, 1977 Directive is the clear instruction.

So, on his advice, I thought he must be right that it was very serious. I went down to Tamalkrishna Maharaj and asked about it. I asked Tamalkrishna Maharaj to please understand that Prabhupada picked the regular gurus when he named the persons who would initiate while he was still with us. Tamalkrishna Maharaj replied that he himself knew very well what Prabhupada intended and that was good enough for him. So, he continues, I tried again to ask him, to ask Prabhupada to sign something, but Tamalkrishna was not willing. So, you see, Tamalkrishna Goswami stalled, obstructed the demand to get Srila Prabhupada's signature on the GBC minutes. Maybe he knew what would happen if they did that. Srila Prabhupada gave clear directions in the July 9, 1977 Directive. Those instructions are unequivocal. We cannot go by what the GBC recorded in the minutes book because it is not countersigned by Srila Prabhupada. Again, for hypothetical argument's sake, if we assume that Srila Prabhupada did indeed want his signature as it was recorded in the minutes of the GBC in writing, one thing is very very clear. The GBC recorded in their minutes that Srila Prabhupada will appoint devotees who shall perform initiations in the future. This is what that recording says. But, did that appointment come from Srila Prabhupada or their grand disciples of Srila Prabhupada? Fact is that the appointment of gurus never came from Srila Prabhupada. Hence, there is no basis for the guru system which was implemented in ISKCON in 1978 nor the one which is currently running. Both are only rubber stamped in 1977 for rittviks not for gurus not for diksha gurus. And in that directive, very clearly it is mentioned that the disciples will be Srila Prabhupada's disciples not the rittviks.

**Summary:** The speaker reads the July 9, 1977 Directive, highlighting that the newly initiated devotees are disciples of Srila Prabhupada.

And here is that directive. So, this directive was written to all GBC and temple members and it is approved by Srila Prabhupada with his signature on this letter. So, this letter begins Dear Maharajs and Prabhus, please accept my humble obeisances at your feet. Recently, when all of the GBC members were with His Divine Grace in Vrindavan, Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would have the purpose of performing initiations, both first initiation and second initiation. His Divine Grace has so far given a list of eleven disciples who will act in that capacity. And then the list of the eleven names was written down in the letter. These were the eleven names. And the letter continues. In the past, temple presidents have returned to Srila Prabhupada recommending the first and second initiation to whichever of these eleven representatives are nearest their temple. After considering the recommendation, these representatives may accept the devotee as an initiated disciple of Srila Prabhupada by giving a spiritual name or in the case of second initiation by chanting on the Gayatri thread just as Srila Prabhupada has done. The newly initiated devotees are disciples of His Divine Grace who receives a letter from these representatives giving the spiritual name or the thread. He can perform the fire ajna in the temple as was being done before. The Devotee who is a devotee of Srila Prabhupada is a disciple of Srila Prabhupada and approved by Srila Prabhupada himself with his trademark signature.

#### Krishna Balram temple, Hrithik Acharya, Tamal Krishna, Guru Kripa

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada is not well. Besides, I think he is busy. Let's not disturb him with this."
**Summary:** The speaker shares an interaction that happened on the Krishna Balram temple courtyard.

So, in four places in the temple in his diary of late July 1977, he has recorded an interaction which happened on the Krishna Balram temple courtyard. Guru Kripa to Bhagawan Why don't we go and ask Lord Krishna? Let's go and see Prabhupada and clarify this Hrithik Acharya thing. Tamal Krishna to Guru Kripa. Prabhupada is not well. Besides, I think he is busy. Let's not disturb him with this. Let's see the next few days, who also recollect about this Hrithik incident. One of them is Gouridas Pandit Prabhu who recalls in On My Behalf. So Gouridas Pandit next morning, July 8th, if there should be Vyasasans for the Ritwiks in the temples. So July 7th was a conversation where Prabhupada gave all the names, which finally appeared on the July 9th directive. But on the intervening day on July 8th, Tamalkrishna Goswami had further questions to ask, so that when he finally made the July 9th letter, all these things could go in. So, on July 9th, he asked them in the next morning, on July 8th, if there should be Vyasasans for the Ritwiks in the temple. Srila Prabhupada said, no, that would create enmity amongst my disciples. Tamalkrishna Goswami also asked Srila Prabhupada if there could be more Ritwiks in the future. Srila Prabhupada said that more could be appointed by the GBC at Mayapur. Tamalkrishna Goswami asked Srila Prabhupada what to do if a Ritwik falls down and Srila Prabhupada replied that, the GBC could remove them. I told some of the devotees what I heard about this and Yashodha Nandan wrote it down in his diary. So, actually, you see, appointment or removal of the Ritwiks is not a major issue. Because if we need more Ritwiks, how will we decide we need more Ritwiks? It is when there are too many devotees to be initiated and whatever number of Ritwiks we have now, it is not sufficing. So, you increase the number of Ritwiks. It is purely based on demand. And when you have to manage demand and supply, it is called management. And the GBC is a managerial body. It will manage appointment as well as removal of the Ritwiks. And that's why Prabhupada's July 9th directive did not talk about appointing or removal of the Ritwiks because the GBCs could do it.

**Key Quote:** "Tamalkrishna Maharaj was talking about the Ritwik gurus to initiate on behalf of Prabhupada after he leaves the planet."
**Summary:** The speaker shares an interaction that happened on the Krishna Balram temple courtyard.

Then Gauridas Pandit Prabhu continues. On July 8th, Yashodha Nandan Prabhu wrote in his diary, Tamalkrishna Maharaj was talking about the Ritwik gurus to initiate on behalf of Prabhupada after he leaves the planet. And on July 9th, Yashodha Nandan Prabhu wrote in his diary. I heard from Tamalkrishna Maharaj in the afternoon, that Sri Prabhupada had told him to send a letter to all temples to explain the Ritwik system for the future. The next day, on 10th of July, Yashodha Nandan Prabhu wrote in his diary, Tamalkrishna Maharaj had written on behalf of Sri Prabhupada to issue a letter to all the temples to explain the Ritwik system for the future. Tamal Krishna Maharaj comes out of Prabhupada's room and the conversation goes like this. Tamal Krishna Maharaj, Haribol, Yesodha, did you see this? Yesodha, no, what is it? Tamal Krishna Goswami. This is signed by Prabhupada. Yesodha Nandan Prabhu, what does all this mean? Tamal Krishna Goswami. Devotees have been writing to Prabhupada asking for initiations and now Prabhupada has named 11 Ritwiks who can initiate on his behalf. Prabhupada said, others can be added. Yesodha Nandan Prabhu. And when Prabhupada disappears, Tamal Krishna Goswami, they will be Ritwiks. That is what Prabhupada said. It is all on tape. And this is what Gauridas Pandit Prabhu has recorded in his On My Behalf. So you see, Tamal Krishna Goswami said, devotees have been writing to Prabhupada asking for initiations. So actually what had happened, after the May 28th conversation, it was clear to everyone. That Prabhupada was going to appoint Ritwiks. So all the initiations were put on hold. And by July 7th, lot of requests had become pending. And that is how Tamal Krishna Maharaj went and asked Prabhupada, what to do now? May 28th, already Prabhupada had said that he is going to appoint some Ritwiks, but that had not happened. And they did not know what to do now. They were waiting. So Prabhupada then, on July 7th, gave the names for the Ritwiks. So when Tamal Krishna Maharaj said, got it, he told Yashodha Nandan Prabhu, devotees have been writing to Prabhupada asking for initiations and now Prabhupada has named 11 Ritwiks who can initiate on his behalf. And Prabhupada said, others can be added. By whom? Naturally by the GBC. In another testimony by His Holiness Chyavana Swami on his Facebook page on September 7th, 2016, he gave a testimony. According to his testimony, Srila Prabhupada said, I will continue to accept this. I will have millions of disciples and give them my blessings. Even after I am no longer physically present, you may initiate them on my behalf.

**Summary:** The speaker shares an interaction that happened on the Krishna Balram temple courtyard.

To that, Prabhupada added, I will have millions of disciples. This is what Chyavana Swami recalls. Yet another devotee from Srila Prabhupada coined the term Ritwik, which was an article on Vaishnava News Network on December 1st, 1998. One devotee, Pitha Prabhu, recollected in 1998, The fact of the matter was, Srila Prabhupada made himself very clear on how new devotees coming into his movement were to be accepted into it after his disappearance. The word Ritwik was first heard by me from Srila Prabhupada's lotus mouth and His Divine Grace used the term many times during his last two weeks in Vandavan. I remember this clearly. Because I didn't know what a Ritwik was. This is Pitha Prabhu. Another devotee, Lochanananda Prabhu, in his book, Srila Prabhupada's Hidden Glories, he writes, One other thing Pitha Prabhu mentioned in the same letter to Lochanananda Prabhu was that he heard Srila Prabhupada say at least a dozen times in Vandavan in 1977 that initiation should be performed after his departure. by the Ritwik Acharya. So, you can see there are multiple devotees who recollect Prabhupada saying that the future initiations, even after his disappearance, would continue to be done by the Ritwiks. Now, let us see what a third party, a person not connected to ISKCON, had to say on this appointment. This is B. V. Puri Maharaj from Sri Chaitanya Chandra Ashram. This is B. V. Puri Maharaj from Sri Chaitanya Chandra Ashram. This is B. V. Puri Maharaj from Sri Chaitanya Chandra Ashram. He recollects a conversation with Srila Prabhupada that he had in late 1977. B. V. Puri Maharaj, Maharaj, you have established 11 Gurus. There is no harmony. There can be no harmony. Guru must be one. You have selected 11 Gurus. Srila Prabhupada, I have not selected. I have appointed 11 Ritwiks. So, even someone outside of ISKCON was very clear and certain.

**Key Quote:** "Hence, the July 9th directive to carry out initiations in ISKCON is not some temporary order. It is the final order of Srila Prabhupada and ISKCON must follow it."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the crucial significance of the May 28th meeting and the July 9th directive, stating that the Rithvik system of initiation is the final order of Srila Prabhupada.

That Srila Prabhupada appointed Ritwiks, not Gurus. And as we have seen the events leading up to the May 28th meeting of the GBC, it was of very crucial significance. Srila Prabhupada had decided to leave the world and came to Vrindavan for that very purpose. And there he called the GBC to Vrindavan to discuss what directions they wanted for the future of the movement after his departure. It was in that context that the May 28th meeting took place. It was in that context that the May 28th meeting took place. It was in that context that the May 28th meeting took place. And the July 9th directive was an outcome of that meeting as it is mentioned in the opening lines of the directive. Recently, when all of the GBC members were there with his divine grace in Vrindavan, Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties. Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties. Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties.

Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon he would appoint some of his senior disciples to act as Ritwik representative of the Acharya for the purpose of performing his duties. initiation. This is the opening line of the July 9th directive. So, this opening line refers to the recent meeting of the GBC with Srila Prabhupada. So, it is clear that this Rithvik system of initiation was particularly for the time when Srila Prabhupada was no longer with us, because that GBC meeting with Srila Prabhupada referred to in the opening line of this July 9th directive is referring to the May 28th GBC meeting. Hence, the July 9th directive to carry out initiations in ISKCON is not some temporary order. It is the final order of Srila Prabhupada and ISKCON must follow it. Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada ki jai. Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the context of the lecture, focusing on Lord's challenge to Hiranyaksha and the powerlessness of demons before the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto No. 3, Chapter No. 18, Text No. 12. You are supposed to be the commander of many foot soldiers and now you may take prompt steps to overthrow us. Give up all your foolish talk and wipe out the cares of your kith and kin by slaying us. One may be proud, yet he does not deserve a seat in an assembly if he fails to fulfill his promised word. A demon may be a great soldier and a commander of a large number of infantry, but in presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is powerless and is destined to die. The Lord therefore challenged the demon not to go away, but to fulfill his promised word to kill him.

**Key Quote:** "Give up all your foolish talk and wipe out the cares of your kith and kin by slaying us."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of the verse, emphasizing the futility of Hiranyaksha's words and the Lord's challenge, drawing a parallel to Dhritarashtra's anxiety.

Thus ends the Bhagavad Gita. So this chapter, the title is The Battle between Lord Bohr and Hiranyaksha. So in this particular verse, Lord is speaking to Hiranyaksha and saying that you are supposed to be commander of many foot soldiers and you may now take prompt steps to overthrow us. And in the previous verses we know that how Hiranyaksha challenges the Lord and blasphemes him. The Lord tolerated his piercing ill words, but in order to reply him, he expressed his terrible anger. So he used many ill words against the Lord, he challenged the supremacy of the Lord. And now the Lord is mentioning, give up all your foolish talk – there's no point in just talking, big, big talks – and wipe out the cares of your kith and kin. Cares of kith and kin, near and dear ones, the relatives, because the battle is about to ensue. So they are concerned what's going to happen, just like Dhritarashtra was concerned what will happen to his kith and kin. Wipe out the cares of your kith and kin by slaying us. How will the cares get wiped out? By slaying us. How Dhritarashtra also when he was anxious, he was anxious what will happen to his sons. And his anxiety will get allayed or rather removed if his sons win the battle. So likewise your kith and kin, the cares can be wiped out if you slay us. One may be proud yet he does not deserve. He does not deserve a seat in an assembly if he fails to fulfill his promised words.

**Key Quote:** "Our constitutional position is that we are amsa of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the constitutional position of living entities as parts of the Lord, emphasizing that everything belongs to Krishna and should be used in His service.

Our constitutional position is that we are amsa of the Lord. Being an amsa of the Lord, whatever we have in our possession, our gross body, subtle body, including the atma, we, belongs to the Lord. The gross body is made of panchabhuta, which is again energy of the Lord, the subtle body, and even the atma, mamaivamso, Krishna says. So in that sense when we become Krishna conscious or come to our constitutional position, there is no question of being proud. When we have a notion of a God who is casting within our consciousness, God is a pursuit of knowledge and knowledge. And on the other hand one will recognize or realize that everything including him belongs to the Lord. And a natural outcome of that understanding would be since the Lord is the proprietor of my body, my abilities, my skills, whatever I have belongs to the Lord, hence it has to be used in the service of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "The whole spiritual life, all spiritual processes are how to annihilate, wipe out that ahamkara, purify that ahamkara and revive our real ahamkara, real ego."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Maya covers the understanding of belonging to the Lord, leading to false ego and challenging the Lord, and how spiritual life aims to purify and revive the real ego as a servant of Krishna.

Now, this understanding gets covered by Maya, the illusory energy of the Lord. When the living entity desires to be the Lord, to challenge the Lord, to rebel against the Lord, this understanding what we have that I belong to the Lord, all my abilities are coming from the Lord, gets covered, and to the extent that we even challenge the Lord, that's what is happening in the case of Renaksha, he is challenging the Lord, forgotten that whatever he has, so the Lord is saying, don't talk unnecessarily, give up your foolish talk. Now the Lord is completely aware of the actual situation, he knows out of false ego he is puffed up. The Lord is all-knowing. So he is saying, give up your foolish talk and wipe out cares of this thing, you want to fight, you think that you are powerful, you can kill me, go ahead, do it. And he says, one may be proud, because of this ahamkara. I heard in one place, there was a man, he was born in our place, but he has everything in life, he belongs to His head. He doesn't have anything left in this life that, what has become eternal now, he is full of past. You can name here 준비, panchabhuta is a secret. अःकारक् everybody is so complex, thirteen percent of that is a secret. Things that are protect. अःकारक् It's like tube-desection for meat, that this is mine. Ahamkara does not come from the Lord. Manas buddhi ahamkara. That false ego does not come from the Lord. Manas buddhi also is coming from the Lord. So that's why we are here in this material world because we have that ahamkara, aham ameti. And the whole spiritual life, all spiritual processes are how to annihilate, wipe out that ahamkara, purify that ahamkara and revive our real ahamkara, real ego. That is I am servant of Krishna, I am amsa of Krishna and I should serve Krishna. And when that real ego gets awakened then we are qualified, we are eligible to go back to the spiritual world and blissfully engage

**Key Quote:** "Arjuna could not protect the queens. He got defeated."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Arjuna's defeat by cowards while escorting the queens from Dwaraka, illustrating how even a great devotee can be overcome by Maya.

Finally, Yudhishthira Maharaj tells Arjuna that you go to Dwaraka now that the Krishna has left, the queens will be all alone, unprotected. You can bring them to Hastinapura so that, you know, always women, Prabhupada also says in the Vedic culture, should always be under the protection of men. So Arjuna was sent to Dwaraka to bring back the queens so that they can be in Hastinapura and since the Pandavas are ruling, they can be under their protection. So Arjuna goes to Dwaraka to bring the kings, the queens and on his way back, he was coming, you know, the chariots were there and the queens were there and many, many queens. So whole big caravan kind of thing. And on the way, he was attacked by some cowards men, Gwalas. And they were not maharatis, they were having, wielding, they were not having some weapons, they were having some sticks in their hands. And weaklings, skinny, you know, seeing them compared to the soldiers in the battlefield who were armed, who were trained, you know, Akshounis, so to say, of soldiers with elephants, with all kinds of horses, well-trained, with all kinds of arms and ammunitions. Compared to that, they were just, you know, ignoble cowards men, weaklings with sticks in their hands. And Arjuna tried to fight against them fiercely so that he can protect the queens because they were attacked. And Arjuna could not protect the queens. He got defeated. Then Arjuna, this is in the Bhagavatam, he makes this wonderful statement. How a devotee can also sometime may get puffed up, may forget his constitutional position, because maya is very powerful. But then very soon, the devotee realizes, just like Prabhupada gives an example, marginal energy. The shore of an ocean, sometimes it is under water, sometimes it is, when the waves recede, then it is, there is no water. So likewise, we also get covered by maya, our consciousness. And then we associate with devotees. We hear Bhagavatam. We read Prabhupada books.

**Key Quote:** "The dhanush is same. The same dhanush which Arjuna used to kill maharatis, big, big soldiers and, you know, Bhishma, Drona, all these kind of people."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the similarities between the battle of Kurukshetra and Arjuna's defeat, highlighting that the only difference was the absence of Krishna.

Again, the maya recedes, the covering, so to say, recedes. So Arjuna says, tad vai dhanus. Now you see, Arjuna is comparing, there are many, many similarities between what was the situation in the battle of Kurukshetra and what was the situation when these cowards men attacked him. There are many, many similarities. Tad vai dhanus. The similarities, the dhanush is the same. Dhanush means bow and arrow. And it is not an ordinary dhanush, gifted by some devata to Arjuna. Tad vai dhanush. The dhanush is same. The same dhanush which Arjuna used to kill maharatis, big, big soldiers and, you know, Bhishma, Drona, all these kind of people. Same dhanush. Sa isha waha. The horses were not ordinary horses. The same horses what were there in the battle of Kurukshetra were there with Arjuna now. Sa isha waha. Sa ratho. The same chariot driven by the same horses. Sa ratho. The ratha is also the same. The horses driving the chariot is also the same. Sa hayaste. And same Arjuna, who is holding the bow. Arjuna is also same. Bow is the same. Chariot is the same. Horses are the same. Arjuna is same. Sa hayaste. Soham rathi. The one who is rathi is referring to himself. Nripatayo yata aanamanti. And then Arjuna says sarvakshanena. In a moment. Tad abhud asad eeshariktham. But there is one difference. That same Arjuna who could kill big big kings. Nirpa. Nirpa means kings. Could destroy them. Could kill them. Could vanquish them. Could defeat them. Same Arjuna driven by the same chariot. Same horses. Same Nandiva bow. Eeshariktham. But there is one difference. In the battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna was there with Arjuna. And here in this particular situation, eeshariktham.

**Key Quote:** "Minus Krishna is like pouring ghee on the ashes. There is no use."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that without Krishna, all of Arjuna's powers were useless, emphasizing the importance of Krishna consciousness and genuine humility.

Krishna is not there. So then Arjuna says, because of absence of Krishna, rest everything is same. Because of absence of Krishna, basman hutam. Just like, on ashes you pour ghee. It does not inflame. Fire doesn't come out. No use. So same Arjuna, same Nandiva bow, same chariot, driven by same horses, minus Krishna is like pouring ghee on the ashes. There is no use. There is no fire coming out. Basman hutam kuh karadham. Just like seed you put in a barren land. No use. Seed may be very good, barren land, it doesn't sprout, evoktam usyam. Just like magic wand. You know you can use the magic wand to show a magic, that money comes out, but no use. Magic wand doesn't bring out money. It's just a magic. Temporally it appears to be like that. No money. No actual money comes out. So likewise, Arjuna is saying, in the absence of Krishna, all my powers, all my fame, all my abilities, because of which I could this thing, in a moment's notice, shanena, all became null and void. So as devotees also we should always remember. Krishna consciousness means that. Sometimes we try to be humble. We sometimes are told, don't be proud. Sometimes we are told, don't get puffed up. Being puffed up is a natural outcome when our pure consciousness is covered by Maya. It's a by-product, or rather it's an outcome of... In other words, somebody who is not Krishna conscious cannot be genuinely humble. The reverse, if somebody is Krishna conscious, he doesn't have to artificially impose, don't know why I should be humble. A natural outcome would be humility. Whatever I have, whatever strength I have, whatever abilities I have, whatever intelligence I have, whatever speaking power I have, whatever singing power I have, it's all coming from Krishna. It belongs to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "All credit goes to the Lord. It belongs to Him."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Arjuna to illustrate that all credit goes to Krishna, and then begins a story about a young man admitted to a prestigious university.

I am just a Kshetragna, a knower of the field of activities. All credit goes to the Lord. It belongs to Him. Just like Arjuna, because he is a devotee of the Lord, the moment he got defeated, he realized. He is not puffed up that, no, because I am great, therefore I could defeat so many great people in the battle of Kurukshetra. He realizes, it was Krishna who was there, because of Him I won. Now that Krishna is not there, it's all useless. All that power, skills, abilities, Gandiva bow, chariot, horses, everything null and void. So here we see Arjuna, and in contrast we see Krishna. Both are amshas of the Lord. One is puffed up, challenging the Lord, wanting to fight against Him. And Arjuna is, because he is Krishna conscious, because he is a devotee of the Lord, realizes his position and he is saying, Without you, no value. One time there was a young man, he got an admission in a very prestigious university, the Liu Pasteur Institute. So this is in Paris. I am sure all of you would have heard about pasteurization, pasteurization of milk. So this person is credited with, so to say, the invention of this pasteurization process. So this person got an admission. It is like, you know, very prestigious like Harvard, MIT and all those things. So he got an admission in there and he was so excited. Some lakhs and lakhs of students apply for it and some selected few get admission. So he was one among them. And he was doing Ph.D.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of the young man in Paris who encounters an old man chanting on a rosary and judges him, only to discover the old man is Louis Pasteur.

He got admission for doing post-doctoral. So he was very happy, very excited. And then he reached Paris. And in Paris, like here we have metro. There also they have, like a metro, local trains within the city. So he boarded the train and he was few stations ahead of him. He had to get down and then from there take a cab to the institute. And since he was young, you know, very ambitious. He had a goal to, you know, make it and he has finally done it. Naturally, you know, some element of confidence was exuding him, bordering towards pride. He was sitting in the train. The train started moving and then suddenly he sees an old man next to him in the seat, just with eyes, you know, half closed, chanting on the rosary and softly murmuring. You know, he was a Christian. And Christians also use the rosary beads and, you know, hail Mary. So they was, he was very softly chanting. So this young man looks at him, this old man. And naturally a feeling of thing comes, useless fellow, wasting time. Like many times people may feel when devotees, they see, you know, chanting and all those things, wasting time. And here I am, young man, full of energy, full of life, full of achievement. Now I am going to do Ph.D. and then after that I am going to pass out. I am going to do research and make a difference in the world. And see this poor fellow, wasting time, simply. So he, anyway. So he asked him, what are you up to? You know, very sarcastically, what are you up to? She said, I am chanting hail Mary. So the conversation ensued. The old man also became inquisitive. Where are you heading? Where are you going? So he said, I have got admission in Louis Pasteur Institute. I am going there. So the old man, some more conversation happened and said, God bless you. Wish you all the very best. The train stopped. The old man gave his card and the old man got down the station. And this young man again continued and in his mind it was their useless fellows. And as the train started, he took the card from his pocket and saw the card. And of the card, it was written, Louis Pasteur. The person, the scientist, whose institute was this, was the person who was chanting on the rosary beads.

**Key Quote:** "More and more, we become knowledgeable. The more and more, we become humble."
**Summary:** The speaker reflects on the story, explaining that pride comes from being half-baked and that true knowledge leads to humility, using Newton as an example.

So, when we are half-baked, we naturally feel that we are on top of the world, we are proud. More and more, we become knowledgeable, the more and more, we become humble. In fact, it is said that scientists like Newton were quite humble. Newton was once asked, you know, when he was in the last days of his life. So somebody approached Newton and said, I am sure when you take your last breath, you will die. You will be leaving this body with lot of satisfaction, with the sense of accomplishment that you have done it. So many accomplishments to your credit. The world will remember you for your accomplishment. You will die as a proud man. So Newton said, what have I done? What have I accomplished? What have I fathomed? What have I discovered? I am like a small boy standing on the shore of mighty ocean. And the whole ocean lies in front of me completely unexplored. Imagine, big ocean and a child is standing on the ocean. He says, I am like a child standing on the shore of a mighty big ocean. And the whole ocean lies in front of me completely unexplored. So it is because of false ego, because of hankara, because of ignorance, we forget our constitutional position and we become puffed up. We become proud. And we also as conditioned souls are no exception.

**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges that conditioned souls are prone to pride and emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's promises.

We are not pure devotees. People like devotees like Prabhupada, they are completely Krishna conscious. Pride cannot touch them. Whereas we all are fallible. We all get puffed up. Somebody praises us. Artificially we say, no, no, no, it's okay, it's okay. Deep within, ah, great. You are a big collector, yes. So, it's a journey. This purification also cannot happen overnight. Slowly as we become Krishna conscious, example is given when the sun rises, all the darkness slowly gradually dissipates. As the sun of Krishna consciousness will rise, genuine Krishna consciousness, the more and more we realize our insignificant position as amsa of the Lord, the more and more all the ahankara, all the darkness which is there, covering our consciousness will get dissipated. So here it is said, the Lord therefore challenged the demon not to go away, but to fulfill his promised word and kill him. One may be proud, yet he does not deserve a seat in an assembly,

**Summary:** The speaker begins a story about a king and his God-fearing minister, where the king mocks the minister's belief that everything happens for good, until he cuts his finger.

if he fails to fulfill his promise. One time there was a king, and he had a minister. So invariably the king was puffed up. Power corrupts, they say. And the minister, relatively, was quite God-fearing, was always believing in God, believing in destiny, whatever is happening is as per the will of the Lord, sanction of the Lord, it's for our good. So he was having that belief. And invariably when the king and the minister would have a conversation, the king would mock at the minister, what are you talking about? Everything is happening for good, God is all good. Whatever is destined will happen in our life. So he would make fun of his minister. But the minister, because he was conscious of the Lord, he would always maintain his stand, yes, God is all good. Whatever is happening is for our good. Just like Krishna says, I am the well-wisher of all living entities. So this minister also would emphatically say, yes, whatever God is doing is for our good. So one day the king was cutting an apple. And unfortunately, because maybe his attention was somewhere else, while cutting the apple he cut his finger. And it got badly cut. Blood started oozing out. And the minister was there. He says, what has happened? See this. And now I know that everything happens for good. Whatever God is doing is for good. What is good in this? My finger has got cut.

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story, where the king imprisons the minister, gets captured by tribals, and is saved from being sacrificed because of his cut finger.

So the minister says, the Lord has a higher plan. Everything happens for good. So the king got wild. You nonsense. My finger has got cut. God has a higher plan. He took that, ordered his minister, put him behind the bars. So he was imprisoned. So the king went out on the forest for hunting. And he somehow lost his way. And he was captured by some tribals, Aborigines. And they took captive. They bound him and took him. And finally he was presented, you know, the whole village, the chief, village chief was there. And there was some puja of some Kali was happening there. And the chief of the village, he was very happy when all his, you know, so-called soldiers brought king, tied, because they wanted to Narabali, offer a human being in sacrifice to Goddess. So he was happy. So nice. Goddess will be very pleased today. It's not an ordinary man. It's not an ordinary man whom you're going to sacrifice. It's going to be a king, because he was in royal robes. And so they untied him. And they brought him close to the Kali. And about to kill him, suddenly the chief said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So they all got up. What happened? Says, no, we cannot offer him. So they were curious. He says, see, his finger is cut. The Goddess will not be pleased if we offer somebody who is not complete. He is incomplete. Finger is not there. So what to do? Okay, useless fellow, go. They relieved him. So the king comes back to the kingdom and, you know, he is now recollecting the words of the minister. You know, whatever happens, God has a higher plan. If his finger was not there, if finger was there, today he would have been chopped off.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes the story, where the king realizes the minister's wisdom and the minister explains that even his imprisonment was for his own good, emphasizing the devotee's faith in Krishna's plan and the purpose of purification.

So now having realized his minister's word, he felt sorry that what he has done to the minister. And he, you know, says, okay, release him. So the minister comes. Says, now I understand what you said. God has a higher plan. Even my finger getting cut, there was a higher plan of the Lord. By the way, do you think that I imprisoned you, that was also a higher plan of the Lord? That is also for your good? He says, yes. He says, how? He said, had you not imprisoned me, I would have invariably accompanied you to the forest. And having realized that your finger is not there, I would have been Narabali. So God is great. Everything which is happening is for our good. So when we are devotees of the Lord, we are naturally conscious of the Lord, His protection, our dependence on Him. Whatever the Lord takes us through, we take it as a blessing. Sometimes we may be able to understand, sometimes we may not be able to understand. A devotee that way never rebels. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, maro bhi raakho bhi jo ichcho to maro. This consciousness naturally stems from a pure Krishna consciousness understanding. Whatever is happening, if we are so long surrendered to the Lord, trying to please our Lord, trying to serve Him, trying to follow this process which will purify us, whatever ups and downs we may go through, even as devotees life, having faith that Krishna has a higher plan, we may encounter some difficulties, some challenges, somebody, you know, not treating us well. We are here for purification. We are not here for a cozy, comfortable life, everyone is good, everything is good. In one lecture we heard that, if we become super peaceful, we all want to be peaceful, no problems, so that we can peacefully practice Krishna. If we become super peaceful, first thing we want to do is, we will forget Krishna. So that way, let's take whatever is unfolding in our lives in stride, be grateful to Krishna, Prabhupada, for Divya Gyan, the knowledge what they have given us, and pursue this process, practice this process very sincerely.

#### anger, scriptural understanding, parampara, superficial understanding

**Verse References:** BG 2.47
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "What meets our eyes is a superficial understanding."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the apparent contradiction of the Lord exhibiting anger when the scriptures advise against it, emphasizing the importance of understanding scriptures through parampara to avoid superficial interpretations.

For someone who is totally new to Krishna Consciousness, this can be bewildering. How can the Lord get angry? Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita Himself says there are three gates leading to hell: lust, anger, and greed. And here the Lord Himself is getting angry. This is Jaisa Achar and then Prachar. So here the Lord is getting angry and grew more and more enraged at the smell of blood of His person. In His eagerness to win, this we see. Okay, actually this can be expected, after all He was a demon, eagerness to win. And Krishna also says you have the right to do your duty but do not be attached to the results. On one side the Lord says control the senses, control the mind. From the very beginning control the senses, and then He marries 16,108 queens. So people sometimes even ask this question: Why the Lord married so many queens? From their understanding, was He not satisfied with one wife? Why did He dance with the gopis? That's why Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita says, what meets our eyes is a superficial understanding. That's why Krishna says, it's a most confidential knowledge. Tatvatah means in truth. What we can understand just by reading like a novel or a comic or any other book, will not be tatvatah understanding. It will not be the real understanding. That's why Krishna says one who understands in tatvatah, in truth, he gets eligible for liberation from the cycle of birth and death. He goes back to the kingdom of God. So how do we understand? Why the Lord who is... And we also understand saintly people are expected to be tolerant, not get provoked. They should be peaceful. They should be equipoised. They should be forgiving. These are all qualities of devotees and Lord should also exhibit these qualities. And here we are saying that the Lord is fighting and Lord is getting angry and is beating Hiranaksha and is eager to win, to defeat Hiranaksha. So how do we understand this? So as I mentioned, if we have not studied the scriptures in a parampara, a parampara understanding, just like Prabhupada is writing the purports, when we read those purports and understand them, all our misconceptions and wrong understandings slowly can get wiped away. Typical understanding is a saintly person means he should never get angry. That's why many times people say Hinduism, because of all this tolerance and ahimsa, that's why these Mohammedans invaded India and we were just simply tolerant and they ransacked the temples, destroyed the temples. And we were all talking about ahimsa, we should be tolerant. Actually that's not the correct understanding. Wherever anger is required, it has to be exhibited. Wherever ahimsa is required, it has to be done. The whole Bhagavad Gita was spoken by Lord to Arjuna to inspire him to fight. Sometimes it can be bewildering what to tolerate, what not to tolerate, when to get angry, when not to get angry. There is a very famous quote which says, not to get angry is very easy. If someone decides I'll not get angry, relatively it's easy. A stone also does not get angry. But to get angry at the right time, in the right circumstances, on the right person, to the right degree, is not very easy. In other words, there is place of anger, there is place for every emotion. The emotions what we exhibit, originally is there in the Lord. Lord is a person, and person means emotions, feelings. And every emotion has a place. Just like Hanuman got angry, and he burned the Lanka. He was a great devotee of the Lord. Everyone worships Hanuman. He worships Hanuman, as a great devotee of the Lord. And he got angry, and he burned the Lanka. And still we glorify him, still we worship him. And still we accept him as a great devotee of the Lord. So many times, people have a very superficial understanding of our scriptures. In fact, many people who come up with these arguments, may not have even read the scriptures. Or if they would have read, they would have read very superficially, some thing written by some author, and they miss out the correct understanding.

**Summary:** The speaker shares a story about a Hindu man in Afghanistan who avoids danger by reciting a verse from the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting the idea that violence often stems from a lack of true understanding of religious texts.

One time there was a family, who was visiting Afghanistan, an Indian family. They had gone to meet some of their friends and acquaintances. So, they were visiting Afghanistan for the first time, and as you all know, it's an area which is strived with lot of terrorism, lot of violence. So this family was going in a car, and suddenly they were stopped on the highway. And two men, with guns, stopped the car, and said, come out. So they were completely, you know, panic stricken, fearful, what's going to happen, fearful of death. Imagine, on the highway, deserted highway, somebody stops the car, and comes with a gun. So their heart started pounding. So anyway, they had no option, they came out of the car, and the so-called terrorist, asked that person, what is your religion? So this person, although he was Hindu, from India, but fearful that they are not going to spare him if he says I am a Hindu. So he spontaneously says, I am a Muslim. So the terrorist, how can he believe? Look like Indian, look like, so he said, can you recite a verse from Quran? So this person is a Hindu, how does he know Quran? Viva voice, they say, just to test your knowledge. So this person, you know, where does he remember Quran? Started, yada yadahi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata, somehow, spontaneously, spoke out that verse, and the terrorist, okay, okay, go. So he got into the car, and went off. So, when they started off, the wife said, hey, why did you say you are a Muslim? And he asked you to quote Quran, and you said, yada yadahi, you quoted a verse from the Bhagavad Gita. Why did you do that? He said, had he read Quran, he wouldn't be a terrorist. It's a fact that, many times, people who are fighting in the name of religion, in fact, you ask anybody, I ask this question quite often, how many of you feel that today the world is in chaos because of religion? 95% of people raise their hands. I've asked this question in many, many gatherings, many, many forums. How many of you feel that today, because of, in the name of religion, people are fighting, the world is in a mess. If you look objectively also, all the fights which are going on in Syria, in Afghanistan, Iraq, all these things, it's all stemming from, you know, these differences, Israel, Palestine.

**Key Quote:** "It's because of fanatic understanding of religion."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that the world's problems are not caused by religion itself, but by fanatic and ignorant interpretations of religious texts, often fueled by vested interests.

So, how many of you feel that the world is in chaos because of religion? Everyone, except for few people, they raise their hands. People see that people are fighting in the name of religion. Religion, which is supposed to bring about peace, harmony, universal brotherhood, actually is doing just the opposite. India got divided, like Prabhupada says in the Bhagavatam, earlier it was all Bharat-Varsha, it got divided in the name of religion: Hindustan and Pakistan. People are seeing that countries are getting divided, countries are fighting in the name of religion. Actually, the fact is, it is not because of religion. It's because of fanatic understanding of religion. Where do people have Tatvataha understanding? First and foremost, people have not read the Bhagavad Gita, not read the Quran, not read the Bible, even if they have read the Bible, or Quran, or whatever it is, it is superficial understanding. Just like, if you read and don't understand in Parampara, what is the understanding we are getting? The Lord is getting angry. And anybody can justify that, anybody can get angry, because we are following, we are devotees of the Lord. So, what has happened is, people with vested interest have fanned the religious sentiments of ignoble people, gullible people, ignorant people, people who are jobless, people who are illiterate, and has created chaos in the whole thing. Many of the so-called jihadis, they may be illiterate otherwise.

**Key Quote:** "The solution is not to pluck out the eyes."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of cataracts and blurred vision, the speaker explains that the solution to problems caused by misinterpretations of religion is not to abandon religion, but to correct the understanding through a bona fide spiritual master and parampara.

Just like we had that terrorist attack in India. They were paid some amount, the family would be paid few lakhs of rupees, and, you know, they were asked to participate in this jihad. So, in one sense, it is a very sorry state of affairs, but the result is not that you do away with religion. It says, just like a cataract, when the eyes have cataract, and the vision becomes blurred, the solution is not to pluck out the eyes. Na rahega baans, na bajegi baansuri. They say, pluck out the eyes, no more cataract, no more blurred vision. But that's not the solution. You remove the cataract, and your vision is restored. So dharma, or religion, has a very important place, because it helps us lead a meaningful life. Without dharma, it is nothing but polished animalism. So, when we understanding in parampara, we are fortunate to understand from a bona fide spiritual master, we can get a clear understanding, and not get bewildered,

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One should be ready to tolerate all insults to one's own self."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the example of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who preached humility and tolerance but also exhibited anger towards those who blasphemed devotees, explaining that devotees should tolerate insults to themselves but become angry when Krishna or his devotees are blasphemed.

when we read such things. Prabhupada says, Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu became angry. Although he says, One who does not deserve respect also, maana dena, respect. Tolerant than a tree. Humbler than a blade of grass. Anybody tramples, it just stands up. Tree, you cut it, it gives you wood. You shake it, it gives you fruits. Tolerant, does not repel back. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who is preaching that, is saying, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu became angry with the miscreant brothers, Jagai and Madai, who blasphemed and struck Nithyananda Prabhu. In his Sastastaka, Lord Chaitanya wrote, One should be humbler than the grass, and more tolerant than the tree. One may then ask, why the Lord exhibited his anger? The same thing here. Lord one side is saying, three gates leading to hell, and other side, he himself is getting angry. Lord Chaitanya is saying, humbler than a blade of grass, and then he is becoming angry, and Jagai and Madai. The point is that one should be ready to tolerate all insults to one's own self. This is the principle. Sometimes we can also get bewildered. No, no, we should get angry. Little bit somebody provoked, angry. And justify, Lord also got angry. The principle is, the point is that one should be ready to tolerate all insults to one's own self. My ego gets hurt, I should tolerate. Somebody speaks something, I feel bad, I tolerate. I become provoked, I tolerate. One should be ready to tolerate all insults to one's own self. But when Krishna or his pure devotee is blasphemed, a genuine devotee becomes angry, and acts like fire against the offenders. Here Mother Earth, she is also a devotee, and Hiranaksha, and the Lord, just like Lord Chaitanya, became angry. Jagai and Madai, they hit Nithyananda Prabhu, and the Lord became angry.

**Key Quote:** "Every emotion has a place, but with the right knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that all emotions have a place when aligned with dharmic principles and used in Krishna consciousness, highlighting that anger can be controlled and directed towards chastising evil-doers and blasphemers.

So every emotion has a place, but with the right knowledge, Tattvata understanding, we can have a proper understanding, where and when to apply that emotion. Just like Krishna said, dharma aviruto kamo asmi, even karma has a place. dharma aviruto, like that, all emotions, if it is not dharma aviruto, in the sense, if it is in line with dharmic principles, have a place. If you always remember Krishna, by your activities, and seeing Krishna everywhere, even in the heart of demoniac persons, then anger will never overcome you. Now how do we tolerate? Suppose somebody is, you know, in the middle of the night, he is provoking us, he is making our life miserable, or he is speaking some sarcastic words, and I am getting affected. So the solution is, if you are always remembering Krishna, and seeing Krishna everywhere, even in the heart of demoniac people, then anger will never overcome you. Being purified of false pride, many times, we get angry because of false pride, because of ego. And then we justify that, so and so is responsible for my anger. Actually, if we look introspect, it is because our ego got hurt, our self-respect, our esteem got affected. Maybe itch chali jayegi, what will people think about me? But occasionally, if there is good reason, you may have to become angry, just to chastise the evil doers, and blasphemers. So specially when we are young, we will require some guidance. Superficial understanding is not to get angry. So Prabhupada says, if there is good reason, you may have to become angry, just to chastise the evil doers, and blasphemers. Because we are living in a material world, where everyone is in one sense diseased. Everyone has ego, everyone has pride, everyone is there to put down others. So sometimes, we may have to get angry, to chastise the evil doers, and the blasphemers.

**Key Quote:** "Anger can be controlled, we cannot stop anger altogether."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while saintly persons tolerate personal insults, they become angry at blasphemy, and that while conditioned souls will get upset, it's important to avoid holding grudges and hatred.

Anger can be controlled, we cannot stop anger altogether. But if we simply become angry with those who blaspheme the Lord, or the devotees of the Lord, we can control our anger in Krishna consciousness. When insignificant persons use rough words to cast false, angry accusations against saintly persons, their fruitless words do not disturb the great personalities. So if it is, mind you here, angry accusations against saintly person, personal attack, just like here it is said, all insults to one's own self, saintly persons, they do not get disturbed. They act like, but when required, evil doers, blasphemers, blasphemers of devotees, blasphemers of the Lord, they have the right to become angry, they should become angry. Sometimes, when we are living in day to day life, we will get upset, we will get, somebody will speak some things, bit critical, unnecessarily, will pass some remarks, as we said, we all are conditioned souls, we are not pure devotees, where we have risen above all this. So when, now here it is said, a saintly person should tolerate, should not get disturbed. Now what if we get disturbed? We will get disturbed. Only when our consciousness has risen to a certain level, when we are advanced in Krishna consciousness, saintly person, great personalities, we will not be affected. Suppose somebody has insulted us, and we get angry, we get affected, we get worked up, and the result of that is, many times, we can either retaliate, or sometime, if it is, let's say a senior devotee, or somebody else, we can't retaliate, deep within, we have grudges, hatred, ill feeling, can't do anything, but then, inside, keep brewing, anger, hatred. In fact, it is said that if a devotee has that kind of a consciousness,

**Key Quote:** "How are you different from a parasite?"
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about being insulted and losing his temper, illustrating the difficulty of tolerating insults and the importance of forgiveness.

he is hurting himself. So, how to keep our heart clean? We will get affected, we will get, so to say, somebody insults us, somebody speaks harsh words. One time, I went out to meet somebody, many years back, when I used to go out for life membership. So, we went to a donor's place, and I was telling him, he had agreed to become a member, and I was supposed to go and collect the membership amount. He was ready, he was having a cheque book in his hand. He was about to write the cheque, and I was sitting, I took out the receipt book, and the person sitting next to me, his friend, he was also there, in his office. So, that person said, what do you do whole day? So, I told him that we get up in the morning, and we have the sadhana, and then we have different services and all that. Then that person suddenly switched tone and said, do you know what is a parasite? So, it took me some time to understand, what is he up to? He said, I understand. Do you know what is a parasite? I said, yeah, I understand. How are you different from a parasite? He asked. Parasite is basically a person, parasite in a body, lives on the other person's blood, or other person's this thing. So, what he was trying to indicate is that we are parasites, we don't do any meaningful work, we beg. We just do little bit of ringing the bell, while our time, and beg people, and live at the cost of others. So, moment I heard that, how are you different from parasite? I became angry. I said, how can you call out so, and I tried justifying, you know, no, you don't know how much we are building a big temple, it's a public temple, so many people will come, temple is required, and all those things. While all this anger discussion was going on, the person took the checkbook, and kept it inside. It was in a drawer. And then he said, Swamiji will see later on. That's it. People don't expect that saintly person should get provoked, and lose temper. That's a natural understanding. And in one sense, that's the understanding which people have. But, we cannot go to other extreme. Now here, this was a blasphemy to me. How are you different from a parasite? Ideal would have been to just tolerate. Just, after all he is ignorant, he has his own understanding of who the devotees are. Maybe he is an atheist. Simply tolerate, and somehow, without offending him, Lord's service should happen. Somehow intelligently, if I had added, he would have even given the check. So sometimes, we will get affected, so to say, we will get, momentarily lose our temper, because we are conditioned souls, we are not pure devotees.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You have to let go."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of monkeys trapped by holding onto bananas to illustrate the importance of letting go of anger, resentment, and ill feelings to find peace.

But the worst thing is, we brew anger within us. We stop talking to someone. Like here it says, the lips in rage, he bit his lip in rage, took up his mace again, and began to repeatedly brandish, you know, anger within. So it is said that for a devotee, it is very important to also cultivate a quality, and that quality is shama. Shama means forgiveness. Just like here it says, if one remembers that the Lord, seeing Krishna everywhere, even in the heart of a demoniac person, the person who has insulted you, if you are Krishna conscious, genuine Krishna conscious, anger will not overcome you. Being purified of all false pride. So it is said that sometimes when people have to catch monkeys, wild monkeys in jungles, they take cages, and they put it in the forest, and inside the cages, they put something which the monkeys like. We all know monkeys like bananas and, so big big bananas, bunches they will keep inside those cages, and they leave them, and they leave them in wild forest. What they expect is that once the monkeys come inside the cage, to eat the bananas, and they will drop the lever, and the cage will get closed. So the monkeys, one or two times they got trapped, but you know, we all learn from experience, monkeys are also that way quite shrewd. So the monkeys saw that, you know, this is a trap for us. So instead of going inside the cage, to eat the bananas, they came on the side of the cage, put the hand inside the cage, and they were trying to take the bananas. So that even if the lever goes in, they will get the bananas also without getting trapped. But then it so happened that people started observing, those who had put those cages, the monkeys would hold big big bananas in their hand, will try to pull it out, but the cage ribs were there, the bars were there, they won't be able to pull out the banana, because bananas were quite big. And they are desperate to eat the bananas, and they will not leave the bananas. Trying, trying, trying, somehow not leaving the banana, and finally they will be caught. So the learning from this is, just like the monkeys, they can go free, if they just drop the banana. So likewise, many times, we just tightly hold on to that anger, resentment, hatred, ill feeling against someone, you have to let go.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating the importance of forgiveness, humility, and letting go of anger, while also emphasizing the need to become angry when the Lord and His devotees are blasphemed, and to beg forgiveness if one gets provoked unintentionally.

We will be peaceful. We have to also analyze, most of the time, that hatred, ill feeling is because I have got insulted. Somebody has hurt me. All of us are conditioned souls, we all are diseased. Jesus says, Father forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. Everyone is acting in lower modes, we all get overpowered. Drop it. We will momentarily get angry. Beg forgiveness, ask forgiveness, let go. Keep your heart clean. Keep your consciousness clean. So if we have that, now having said that, we have to avoid the other extreme. Other extreme is, every time let go. If the Lord and His devotees are blasphemed, we have to get angry. If I get insulted, I tolerate. If unknowingly, unintentionally, in spite of this, I get provoked, I get angry, I use harsh words, I beg forgiveness. I let go.

**Key Quote:** "If we have experienced real love. Real beauty of the Lord, then we will experience that satisfaction."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by surrendering to Krishna (Madan Mohan) and experiencing divine love, one can overcome lusty desires and the enchantment of material beauty.

World over, people are enchanted by Cupid, arrows of Cupid. Cupid shoots arrows, pierces our heart. We have that picture of a heart being pierced by an arrow, lusty desires. And Cupid is called Madan, and Krishna is called Madan Mohana, who enchants the Cupid, who is much, much more attractive, millions of times more attractive than the Cupid, so-called beauty in this material world. So if we get enchanted by Madan Mohana, if we worship Madan Mohan, if we surrender to Madan Mohan, if we follow the instructions of Krishna, Madan Mohan, which is given in the Bhagavad Gita, then Cupid has no place in our lives. We will not be tormented, will not be shot at by the Cupid, if we have experienced real love, real beauty of the Lord. Then we will experience that satisfaction, we will experience that higher taste.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the mentality of personal deliverance with the desire to serve Prabhupada's mission of expanding Krishna consciousness through building temples, emphasizing that spiritual life involves accepting inconvenience for a higher purpose.

Why build this temple? So many donors, so many problems, so many escalations. There can be this mentality. There could be somebody who is interested in his own deliverance, personal deliverance. A person with that mentality, why should I break my head? Why should I be involved in this thing? Unnecessary tension, stress, anxiety. But if we execute the instructions of Prabhupada, who desired that preaching be expanded, desired that temples be built, more and more people get Krishna consciousness. Prabhupada very emphatically demonstrated by his personal example what he desired, what he wanted from his disciples. Spiritual life means austerity, tapo divyam. And austerity means voluntarily accepting some inconvenience for a higher purpose. There may be inconvenience, but we accept it for a higher cause.

**Summary:** This segment introduces the context of the verse, focusing on Pariksit Maharaj, the curse by Shringi, and the influence of Kali Yuga.

tasya putrati tejasvi niharan balako arba kahe rajnagam prapitam tatam sutva tatredam abhravesh Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada Translation The sage had a son who was very powerful, being a brahmana's son. While he was playing with the inexperienced boys, he heard of his father's distress, which was occasioned by the king. Then and there the boy spoke as follows. Due to Maharaj Pariksit's good government, even a boy of tender age who was playing with his other inexperienced boys could become as powerful as qualified brahmana. The boy was known as Shringi, and he achieved good training. In brahmacharya by his father, so that he could be as powerful as a brahmana, even at that age. But because the age of Kali was seeking an opportunity to spoil the cultural heritage of the four orders of life, the inexperienced boys gave a chance for the age of Kali to enter into the field of Vedic culture. Hatred of the lower orders of life began from the brahmana boy under the influence of Kali, and thus cultural life began to dwindle. Day after day. The first victim of brahmana injustice, brahmanical injustice, was Maharaj Pariksit. And thus the protection given by the king against the onslaught of Kali was slackened. Thus ends the bhaktivedanta purva.

**Key Quote:** "Good governance means to protect the citizens, kshatriyas and also protect the kingdom from the influence of the sinful habits, sinful tendencies."
**Summary:** This segment explains the divine plan behind the events, the role of Pariksit Maharaj in protecting against Kali Yuga, and the importance of good governance.

So just to give you a context of what's being mentioned in this verse. In the previous verse, Pariksit Maharaj, while he was in the forest, he saw the sage. Reached his hermitage. And since the sage was busy in his meditation, he didn't open his eyes. He didn't properly receive the king as per the etiquette. So he was very angry. Many leelas which are mentioned in the Bhagavatam, if we understand in the context of the divine plan of the Lord, we'll be able to understand them correctly. One may question, if Pariksit was such a great devotee of the Lord, why did he become angry? Why did he feel insulted? Just because he was not received respectfully. In fact, a devotee of the Lord is very tolerant. Like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, He is more tolerant than a tree. He is humbler than a blade of grass. So overall, it's a divine plan of the Lord. As we all know, there are four cycles, four yugas. Kali Yuga, Treta Yuga, Satya Yuga, Dwapara Yuga. And Kali Yuga had to begin. So Shringi, who is the Brahmana's son, So what did Pariksit do? When he felt insulted, he took a dead snake which was lying nearby and put it around the neck of the Brahmana. So Shringi, who is the son of this Brahmana, he saw his father being insulted. He felt very offended and he cursed Pariksit Maharaj. And in this verse, Prabhupada is mentioning that the influence of Kali, when there is a strong king like Pariksit Maharaj, good governance means to protect the citizens, kshatriyas and also protect the kingdom from the influence of the sinful habits, sinful tendencies Like meat eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, which is very rampant in present times. because we are in the midst of Kali Yuga.

**Key Quote:** "As devotees of the Lord, yes, we have a duty to see how we can reach this message, distribute the holy name to people."
**Summary:** This segment describes the symptoms of Kali Yuga and emphasizes the duty of devotees to spread the message of the Lord.

And thus cultural life began to dwindle day after day. So since Pariksit Maharaj was cursed and then he was cursed to die in next seven days. So the world lost a great king like Pariksit Maharaj and once the king is not very strong then things start deteriorating. The first victim of Brahminical injustice, now Sringi was a Brahmin boy, Brahminical injustice against the lower orders like Kshatriyas, Brahminas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras. So it says the injustice of the Brahminical injustice began with Pariksit Maharaj. So, to curse Pariksit Maharaj to die in seven days was not appropriate even if we were to evaluate what Pariksit Maharaj did. But Pariksit Maharaj instead of counteracting or counter cursing Sringi, he accepted it. He went to the bank of Ganges, heard the Srimad Bhagavatam and died remembering the Lord. So, as I mentioned earlier, we are in Kali Yuga and Kali Yuga is of all the four ages is the most degraded. And, we can see the symptoms. What do you mean by that? Yes, they are degrading. Yeah. It's coming to you. He's seem consistently degrading. It has not only sounded degradatory but. But I'm not saying he is dead. In fact, the symptoms are mentioned in the Srimad Bhagavatam and which are very much visible to us in present times. There's a lot of fights happening, lots of wars happening, a lot of confusion, a lot of quarrels happening. Meat-eating is rampant, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex, extramarital affairs, live-in relationships. What was not so common, what was unheard of maybe 20 years back, has become very common. So as devotees of the Lord, yes, we have a duty. To see how we can reach this message, distribute the holy name to people. It's our duty, it's Prabhupada's mission.

We have to protect ourselves. We have to insulate ourselves. Like in the flight also when you travel. They say that the oxygen thing will, the mask will fall down from the top.

This was more than 20 years back. And those days, I think, it would have been 20 years ago. This was more than 20 years back. And those days, I think, it would have been 20 years ago. It was black and white television. And I, even till date, remember this. But those days, it was not like you like some episode, you save it, you can download it. It's on YouTube. I vaguely remember. There was a man. He was very poverty stricken. And Practically had no money with him. He had a young daughter. And he was barely able to manage the day-to-day needs of the family. Including groceries and clothes. So the daughter was getting, you know, the marriageable age. And he was in anxiety, how to marry the daughter. And he was in anxiety, how to marry the daughter.

Some dowry was also given, not in the sense, what we see in present times, it is demanded. It was out of love. So, this person was a lot of, had a lot of anxiety, lot of worry, how to manage his household expenses. How to marry the daughter.

But you will not be allowed to interact with people. with anyone, including your family, including your near and dear ones. Even in prisons they have, you know, in a month you can for some five minutes or something you can meet. There's some protocols. But here the condition was that for ten years you cannot talk to anyone, you cannot meet anyone, you cannot hear anything. There were no smart phones, there was no mp3 players. You can hear the songs, FM radio, nothing. And you all know that man is a social animal. We thrive on relationships, social beings. Relationships are very important. So this man accepted the challenge and he thought instead of struggling the whole life, it's a struggle for 10 years. I'll somehow manage. But he never anticipated what that struggle would be, how intense that struggle would

These days you have some reality shows where somebody is put in some house. I haven't seen anything, just maybe some idea and then people watch what they are doing. So for 10 years he was in this room, locked. Three times food was served to him, and then first initial 1 week 10 days. He was... He started missing something, something unusual. See one day we can manage food, second day, something, you know, we feel very uncomfortable. So likewise if we are in a room and all by itself... One day, two day, we can somehow manage. So after one week, ten days, he started feeling very uneasy. And that started showing up on his face, on his expression. He started becoming uncomfortable, little jittery. Felt like talking to someone but there's nobody. Even the camera captured whatever he was speaking, whatever he was expressing, whatever words he was speaking also was being captured, was being shown. So he even started thinking that is it really worthwhile taking this challenge and stay for ten years? Because seven days itself was so difficult. And he started even thinking that maybe let me walk out. But then what else will he do? How will he get the money? So he continued. One month passed, two months passed, three months passed. And then after three months, he became so agitated because of loneliness. No companionship, nobody to talk to. Sometimes he would be shouting, screaming, hitting his head on the walls. Sometimes he started becoming... He started becoming... He started becoming... A little bit mad. Anyway, he kept on going. One year passed, two years passed, three years passed. And now he almost became like mad. He had big beard, you know, hairs not combed. Maybe not bathing daily. And at times screaming, at times howling.

**Key Quote:** "And it was quite evident from his face that he's suffering. He's suffering. He's miserable. He's not able to take it."
**Summary:** This segment describes the man's descent into near madness due to prolonged isolation, emphasizing his suffering and the anticipation of the end of his ordeal.

The camera would capture. He would be lying for hours together on the floor. No proper time for sleeping. You know, we all have a schedule. Morning we get up, we have to go for work. Somebody comes, meet. And then night time comes, we sleep. But here you have no one. You practically don't know whether it's day or night. It's a dark, dungeon room all alone. So three years passed. Four years pass. And it was quite evident from his face that he's suffering. He's suffering. He's miserable. He's not able to take it. But somewhere, whatever sanity he had, he was trying to reconcile. Another five years. Another four years. And then a couple of more years passed. Seven years. Eight years. Eight years. And by now, he had practically become mad. For you would see the camera would capture. He would start screaming. Whatever he's speaking is incoherent. Whatever is not making any sense. He's shouting. He's screaming. All by itself. Just like you go to a Nimhans or some mad people, you can see. They'll be laughing. No reason. Talking. No reason. What they're talking is all gibberish. So, the camera was capturing everything. You could hear what he was speaking. You could hear what he was shouting, screaming. Everything. Now, nine years passed. This man, although a little bit, whatever little sanity is waiting, when that one year will pass and he can walk out. Sometimes, some very interesting thing which has to happen. Or some very important festival or something. So, we wait. Countdown. Countdown starts. 30 days left. 35. 28 days left. So, in his mind, probably the countdown had begun.

#### Bhagavad Gita, Transformation, Higher Taste

**Key Quote:** "Little by little, he started getting interested in what is being written, what is written in the Gita."
**Summary:** This segment narrates how the man receives a Bhagavad Gita and gradually becomes interested in it, marking the beginning of his transformation.

So, then, I clearly remember, somehow, he got a copy of Bhagavad Gita. Just for your information, in ISKCON also, many devotees go and preach in prisons. And just for your information, not everyone who is behind bars or who is in prison is quite possible there could be innocent people also. So, not everyone. Everyone is a hardcore criminal. So, devotees go and many times the Gita's also are distributed. So, somehow, this person got the Gita and, so the camera is not, what is he doing with the Gita? He is all alone, all the time in the world, nothing else to do, started reading Gita. So, initially when he was reading Gita, it was quite evident from his face, facial expression, it is not making any sense to him. Probably he is not able to understand what is written. Like it happens when you first try to read Gita, it may look like it is very philosophical and maybe for some it may be difficult to understand. So, he started reading and then it was quite evident that it is not interesting. It is not making any sense. So, he would, you know, flip few pages and then he would close it and keep it. Again, he would pick up after some time or maybe after few days. And then, the camera captured very interesting thing. Little by little, he started getting interested in what is being written, what is written in the Gita. So, he started with some bit of sobriety reading what is there in the Gita. He started becoming little sober. It appeared, this whole episode was, the camera is capturing the action. So, whole expression was that what he is reading is now started making sense to him.

**Summary:** This segment describes the man's increasing absorption in the Gita, leading to calmness, sobriety, and a sense of contentment, as he begins to understand the purpose of life.

And then, nine years, six months passed. Now, daily, three hours, four hours, he is reading Gita. And then, seven months passed. Nine years, seven months passed. By now, he had calmed down. All that agitation. All that anxiety. All that screaming, shouting, howling. All that had calmed down. And then, six hours, seven hours, he is reading Gita. Nine years, nine months passed. And now, he was completely calm. He was very sober. Very intensely, very sincerely reading Gita daily. Nine years, eleven months passed. Thirty days to go. And you could see from his face, there is some bit of divinity reflecting. You know, some sages, very austere, you can see from their face. So, the camera captured that. Very calm, very sober, very serene, very contentment reflecting on his face. Ten days left. Nine years, eleven months, twenty days over. He started experiencing so much of joy, so much of bliss, so much of happiness, reading Gita. That started feeling that whatever I had to gain in life, whatever I want, I have already achieved. After all, why we need money? Why we need, ultimately, the common denominator in everyone's life. Whether somebody needs money, somebody needs adventure, somebody is fond of travelling, somebody is fond of renunciation, somebody is fond of different hobbies. Ultimately, it's for happiness, feeling good.

**Key Quote:** "Now that I have got you, which is like valuable jewel, what I was looking for was nothing. I don't want."
**Summary:** This segment connects the story to the pastime of Dhruva Maharaj, illustrating the renunciation of material desires upon realizing a higher purpose and experiencing spiritual fulfillment.

So, the camera was capturing, which is in line with the pastime of Dhruva Maharaj, who went to the forest, did austerities, and then when the Lord came, gave darshan and said, What do you want? He said, I don't want anything. Now that I have got it. I was looking for broken pieces of glass. Now that I have got you, which is like valuable jewel, what I was looking for was nothing. I don't want. I don't want any varam. I don't want any benediction. I just want you. Because now that I have you, I have everything. So, maybe the inspiration from this particular pastime, so this person, nine years, eleven months, one day left, for him to walk out of that room, with that huge sum of money, he felt that money is not required. Now that he, has everything, he has understood the purpose of life, he has understood the message of Krishna, and then this person is shown that one day before his tenth year getting completed, he walks out of that room. And he says, I don't want your money. Maybe whatever that episode was made, or that film was made, inspiration must have been taken from Dhruva Maharaj's pastime.

**Summary:** This segment shifts to a discussion of Kali Yuga, highlighting the temptations and distractions of the modern world, particularly social media, and how they capture our attention for profit.

Wanted to maybe convey in this thing. The point here is, in Kali Yuga, we will be tempted. There are lot of distractions. There are lot of allurements. And as time is passing by, it's on the rise. Many of us may not be even aware that we may already be addicted to smartphones. These algorithms have been designed by the best of brains. MIT, Harvard, Stanford, all these elite students, they work in Facebook, Google, all that. And they are, they are, in one sense, the common people are guinea pigs. Our, so to say, our innocence is being played with. We are victims. No doubt, I am not against social media or smartphones. But, many of us may not realize, or already would have realized, that how it is addictive. 15 minutes, 20 minutes, you want to watch something, or do something, but then, hours pass by. Because that's how it is designed. The algorithms are designed. You see something, the next related thing will be served. We are having a symposium going on, which says that whole principle is, to capture your attention. The content you produce, if you are able to capture the attention, they will promote your content. And the content creators, brainy fellows, in different fields, producing content. And it's flooded with content. And algorithms are serving that content, and capturing our attention. And that captured attention is being sold to the advertisers.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of protecting the creeper of bhakti and experiencing a higher taste to avoid falling for the allurements of lower tastes in Kali Yuga.

Okay, you have a product. Whom do you want to show? Which demographic? Which country? Which age group? Which gender? Which city? Which town? Which locality? I will serve. Give me this much money. They may not say, but this is how the whole industry is. So we as devotees, janma sarthakari, we have got Prabhupada's message. We have got, khanda brahmite kono bhagyavan jeev, guru krishna prasade paaye bhakti lata abhij. We have got the bija. But, we should protect the creeper of bhakti. And as I said, with the influence of Kali Yuga, there are lot of allurements, lot of temptations, lot of distractions. And if we don't safeguard ourselves, we will fall for it. Krishna also in the Gita says, just by artificially restraining ourselves, restricting ourselves, we cannot protect. We cannot say, I will not see, I will not do, I will not do this, I will not say this. Sometimes, devotees can also fall in a trap of, that what we try to resist, it persists. The more we say, no, no, no, no, no, it again hits us back with more intense force. So that's why Krishna in the Gita says, raso varjam rasopi asya param drishtva nivartate by experiencing a higher taste. And, how will we experience a higher taste? All the emanation, all the tools, everything Prabhupada has given. If we don't use that, if we don't experience a higher taste,

#### Higher Taste, Necessity, Survival

**Key Quote:** "Necessity is the mother of invention."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal story about eating poorly cooked rice during a curfew to illustrate how necessity drives us to accept even unpleasant things when no better alternative exists, relating it to the need for a higher taste to avoid lower ones.

we will fall for lower taste. I remember when there was some curfew, I was studying, when I was doing my engineering, we were in the third year, sixth semester, and somehow there was curfew, and we were stuck in the hostel. It was a long curfew. And even the mess, the canteen, where the food was cooked, that was also shut down, and people had left. So few of us were there in the hostel, we cannot now take a bus and go back home. We were in the hostel. The mess is closed. And I clearly remember that day, not because we were fasting, sometimes we don't eat, not because food is not available, we choose not to eat. But that was a day, when morning to evening, we had no option to eat. There is nothing around, which you can eat. So it was four o'clock in the evening, although there was a curfew, we, friends, walked out of our room, went to nearby kiosk, where they used to make some tea, coffee and all that. And there was one small shop, it was closed, we somehow requested it, and got some rice. I can relate with what is hunger. It was four in the evening, not eaten since morning, maybe previous night also not eaten. Got some rice, there was nothing, no vegetable, no dal, no masala, this thing and all that. Came back to the room, and in hostel room, some of you may be able to relate with what I am saying, maybe times have changed. So we used to have those electric heaters, raw coils, and then some pan to boil water, or to make tea sometime. And in hostel typically, that pan is full black, because you don't wash it so often, or maybe you don't know how to wash it. So came back to the room, had never cooked rice, no idea how the rice is cooked, but circumstances of such you have to, necessity is the mother of invention. So put the rice, put the water, and put it on that heater. And slowly that water started boiling, and no idea how much it has to boil, how long it has to boil. And first time in my life, I saw black rice. We have heard of brown rice, red rice, I saw cooked black rice. And, couple of my friends, we had option either to throw it, visual thing was to throw it, but stomach was saying, no, eat it. And we ate it. I guarantee, if anybody were to see that rice, you will spit at the thought of eating it. But, if you have no option, you will eat it.

**Key Quote:** "If you have no higher taste, if you are not relishing higher taste... then we will fall for lower rasas. And that is what Kali Yuga is. The higher taste is missing in people."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the importance of sadhana and relishing a higher taste to avoid addictions and the degraded state of Kali Yuga.

So same is the case with us, if you have no higher taste, if you are not relishing higher taste, if you are not chanting daily, regularly, Krishna also talks about how you can be like a lotus in a dirty pond, untouched by the dirt of the pond. So, Prabhupada has given us everything, the higher taste is there. Nice, wonderful kirtans, deities, we can come, we can spiritually rejuvenate, recharge. The temples are like oasis, it's like a desert, outside. Desert in the sense, although it may be raining, it may be, we may have green parks or something, we may have a little bit of material existence, we are parched, we are thirsty. Real pleasure is not there and we are hankering for that. So, if we have to, so it is, Prabhupada has given us the morning sadhana, raso varjam raso piyasya param drishtva nivartate. So, if we have that higher taste, on a daily basis, taking that medicine, chanting, reading, hearing, then we will not fall for the lower things. These days, lot of people are struggling with different kinds of addiction, alcohol, smoking, drinking, social media, smartphones, wrong sites, and people are also trying different things, how to come out of those addictions. There was an article called six human needs. There are needs, just like food, clothing, shelter, it's a need. Likewise, there are other needs. Needs for variety, needs for stability, needs for recreation. And if we don't get in a right way, the right quality of rasa, then we will fall for lower rasas. And that is what Kali Yuga is. The higher taste is missing in people.

**Key Quote:** "Unless our consciousness changes... we always think that if I achieve this, I will be happy."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that true happiness comes from a change in consciousness, not from external achievements or material possessions.

And that's why people are just helplessly falling for the lower tastes. So, we can always blame. People hope against hope, the new government will come, good days will come. Yesterday in the symposium, somebody was saying, how the campaign is made, political parties, they strategize. People believe, good days are coming, and they vote. Unless our consciousness changes, unless our... One thing is very clear, you all can relate with this, we always think, that if I achieve this, I will be happy. Small story, there was a person, a king living in a palace, but somehow he was not happy. Always, you know, sad, morose, even though he was living in a palace, had everything, all the opulence, all the luxuries, everything at his beck and call, but not happy. And whenever he would come on his balcony, he would see, he could see at a distance, there was one small hut, made of thatched roof. And, the person staying, that farmer, who was sitting, staying in that hut, whenever he would walk, he would just be fully, jubilant, smiling, happy, singing, dancing. So the king became jealous, became envious, what is this? I have everything, and I am not happy, this person is smiling.

**Key Quote:** "I have everything, and I am not happy, this person is smiling."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a story about a king who is envious of a happy farmer, despite the king's wealth, to illustrate that material possessions do not guarantee happiness.

This happened with me also. When I was, my father was in public sector, he used to live in a big bungalow. And, you know, everything was there, all facilities was there. Somehow, exam time, lot of stress, tension, anxiety. And there was one servant, servant quarter. He would be, coming and then, he would have a transistor, and he would put some film song, and he would, you know, smile and, I used to also feel, you know, he is smiling, he is happy, living in a servant quarter, living in a big bungalow. And same is the case with most of the people. Don't think Mukesh Ambani is fully happy. Although he may show. Same is the case with everyone. Because real happiness, is a different commodity. Money cannot buy that. Money is important for, money can buy us lot of goods, lot of materials, lot of things. But not necessarily, person who has money is happy. So this person would walk out of his house, and he was very happy, always singing, smiling. So the king became envious. So he asked his minister, how is it that I am not happy, I have everything, I am living in a palace, and this person has nothing. But he seems to be smiling. So the minister immediately looked at the king, looks like, he has not joined the 99 club. So the king had heard of Rotary club, Lions club, what is this 99 club? So he said, I will show you what is 99 club, and what it means to join 99 club. So then, this minister, took a bag of 99 gold coins, and one night, quietly went and placed this bag, outside the door of this hut.

**Key Quote:** "Where is the 100th gold coin?"
**Summary:** The story continues, explaining how the minister introduces the farmer to the '99 club' by leaving a bag of 99 gold coins, which leads the farmer to become unhappy and focused on the missing coin.

So next morning, this farmer, he came out of the house, he saw something very unusual, just outside the door. He saw a bag, he became curious, he picked up the bag, he opened the bag, and he was delighted. 99, sorry, gold coins. He didn't know how many. So when you get something, some lottery, so curiosity is that, okay, how much? How much? So he started opening the bag, started counting the coins, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and the last coin, it was 99. So he said, something is wrong, one coin is missing. Generally, if you get a bundle of notes also, you know, it could be either 100. Many times, you don't even count, somebody says, 100 notes, bundle of 100, 100 notes. So he counted again, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the last coin he counted, 99. So he should be happy or sad? He became sad. Where is the 100th gold coin? Who took it? Where did it go? So then, he said, doesn't matter, maybe Lord wants me to work hard to get it. So till then, he had lived a very carefree life, happy go lucky, merry life. And then from that day onwards, he started working hard to earn enough money so that he can collect enough money, buy a gold coin and have the satisfaction and happiness that he has 100 gold coins. Earlier, he used to very leisurely come out of his house. Whatever time he would feel, he would work and then come back, relax. And then now, he would go out of his house early in the morning, 8 o'clock, work very hard, come back late, stressed, anxiety. And the king noticed that from his balcony. Suddenly, what has happened to him? There is no longer smile on his face. He is always stressed out, coming back late to his house. So minister, now he has joined the 99 club.

**Key Quote:** "We have 99 things in your life which are good to be grateful for... But we are crying, waiting for one thing to happen when we will be happy."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concept of the '99 club,' highlighting how we often focus on what we lack rather than being grateful for what we have, hindering our happiness.

So all of us can laugh but we are also part of this 99 club. What is 99 club? 99 club means you have 99 things to be happy. 99 things in your life which are good to be grateful for, to be happy, to be delighted, to be thankful, to thank Lord Krishna, you have given me so much. But we are crying, waiting for one thing to happen when we will be happy, when we will go back to Krishna and say thank you Krishna, you have given me so much. If that is our state, we will never be happy. And most of us are not grateful at times, even as devotees. Sulking, finding faults, criticizing, blaming, blaspheming. How will we experience higher taste? Higher taste is not just okay, chanting is very important, reading is very important, but what do we do the rest of our day? Are we always sulking, complaining, blaming, finding faults, cursing people, cursing others, cursing the environment, cursing the traffic? Or counting our blessings, Krishna you are so kind, Krishna you are so merciful, Prabhupada you have given me so much, you have given me the holy name, I am so rich, I am so fortunate, I have everything in this world.

**Key Quote:** "We should be contented with what we have and for the sake of doing good to others, we should have some goals."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of gratitude and contentment while also acknowledging the value of having goals for the benefit of others.

So it is very important that we count our blessings, we be grateful to Krishna for giving us so much. Yes, all of us may be lacking something, everyone will be lacking something, something may be missing, something, yes we may also have some goals, I want to achieve this, be this, do this, have this, that's okay, that's fine. We are not saying that life should be completely bland. Yes, we should be contented with what we have and for the sake of doing good to others, we should have some goals. Prabhupada also was very, had aspirations, there is nothing wrong in having aspirations, I have to distribute more books, reach out to more people, open more temples. But goals not because I am lacking something and with the hope, with the desire that one day when I have that, I will be happy. Then it's a rat race and there is no end to it. I remember when I was in 10th, my father used to tell me, if you get good marks in 10th, your life is done. Then you know, everyone is laughing because you have also heard from your parents. Then same thing repeated in 12th. By 12th, it was with more force beta. This is the time when you get in good engineering college, then better four years, five years, at least you will be an engineer.

**Key Quote:** "If you get good marks in 10th, your life is done."
**Summary:** The speaker shares personal anecdotes and references a book by an MIT professor to illustrate the 'rat race' mentality and how achieving external goals does not guarantee lasting happiness.

But after you get into engineering college, it's a rat race. Always, there is a book written by a professor in MIT who did his studies in MIT and later on he became a professor and he has written a book on happiness. And he says, when I went to MIT, I was very excited because it's the most elite college, the best of the students from all over the world. Getting into it is very, it's a very prestigious college. Some of you have heard of MIT. So he says, I was very happy. And when I took admission, all the students were so happy. You know, we had the welcome address and everyone was like, our life was done. In seven days, that happiness was gone. And then in that book, he shares the statistics. He says, about 30% students in MIT go through phases of depression. And some 8% of that amount, depressed students, get into such heavy depression that they even are not able to continue with their studies. And then he did research on the subject called happiness to find out why is it that people are not happy, even though they are in such prestigious college. All the people who would pass out from MIT would get, you know, the best of jobs and best of companies, earn the best of salaries, why are they not happy? Then he said, we are working with a paradigm that if I get this, I'll be happy. Just like if I get admission in MIT, I'll be happy. That happiness will last for a few days. If I get promotion, I'll be happy. If I get a child, I'll be happy. For a few days, you'll be happy. If I get a new car, I'll be happy. If I get a new bungalow, I'll be happy.

**Key Quote:** "As a soul, atma, we are looking for a different happiness. We are Sat, Chit, Ananda. Constitutional happiness is a different commodity."
**Summary:** This segment distinguishes between material and spiritual happiness, emphasizing that true and lasting happiness comes from relishing a higher taste through spiritual practices.

But as a soul, atma, we are looking for a different happiness. We are Sat, Chit, Ananda. Constitutional happiness is a different commodity. That's why Prabhupada emphasizes spiritual happiness. Material happiness, spiritual happiness. Higher taste comes when we are relishing spiritual happiness. And when we relish spiritual happiness, we'll be able to give up material happiness. That's why many of us would have come across when we take up Krishna Consciousness, automatically our inclination for going for movies, going for some restaurants outside, it automatically goes down. So that professor, in that book he writes that how this paradigm is, if I get this, I'll be happy. If I get this, I'll be happy. Paradigm should be different. The paradigm should be that I already have so much. If I am not happy with whatever I have, 99 things which I have, what is the guarantee if I get the 100th thing, I'll be happy? So as devotees, we should always recognize that how much Prabhupada Krishna has given us, how much blessed we are, how much fortunate we are, what all we have. We have the highest game, Nama Chintamani, touchstone. If we are not happy, if we are not sad, the problem is with us, problem is with our thinking, problem is with our mindset.

It's not with anyone else. So to recap, whatever we discussed, Kali Yuga, it's in full force. We as devotees have to protect ourselves. Prabhupada Krishna has given us lot of tools, lot of higher tastes, Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam. We have to do our sadhana nicely, protect ourselves, insulate ourselves, experience this higher taste and try our best to help others. That is what Prabhupada is expecting from us. That will make our human form of life successful.

**Key Quote:** "Our Krishna conscious philosophy is not to be desire-less but right kind of desires."
**Summary:** This segment addresses a question about desires, clarifying that spiritual aspirations and bona fide desires are acceptable within Krishna consciousness.

We'll stop here. Anyone has any question, anything like to ask? One question probably we can. Hare Krishna Prabhu. For many years I had a desire that I should attend Kumbh Mela, like 99 club. Kumbh Mela? Kumbh Mela. Because my father was in a travelling job, he was, so he used to go, now called Prayagraj. So now when I come here, today I feel it's Kumbh Mela. The reason is that the Ganga of Harinam is flowing and the various sadhus of Hare Krishna movement are here due to the synopsis. So I feel that I have received my Kumbh Mela today here in spite of my being in 99 club. I'll get a curse of avoiding you of Kumbh Mela. So we have to understand 99 club thoroughly. You should not say I'll not go to Vrindavan because I got going to pilgrimage. Everything has a place, right? So we have to see it properly. We should aspire for the right things. We cannot be desire-less. The goal is not to be like a stone. Stone is very peaceful, very calm, no agitation, sitting in one place. But, we are not like stones. So our Krishna conscious philosophy is not to be, is to have desires but right kind of desires. So one may have a desire that I should go to Kumbh Mela and, you know, have, bathe in Ganges, associate with devotees. It can be a bona fide desire. May not be necessary because unless you go there, you will not be happy. Just we need variety. We need association of devotees. It's a human need also to travel. So little bit intelligently we have to see. Some desires are bona fide desires. Like Prabhupada, he had so many desires. Spiritual desires we can have. I want this. I want this temple to be built. So we have to little bit be careful. Sometimes we can think that any desire is wrong. We can have desire which can be which are authorized and which are bona fide. We'll stop here.

#### Parikshit Maharaj, Srimad Bhagavatam, Religious Principles, Kali Yuga

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Srimad Bhagavatam is a ripened fruit of all Vedic literature."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about King Parikshit's contemplation and discusses the importance of Srimad Bhagavatam as the essence of all scriptures, highlighting the six questions asked by the sages of Naimisharanya and the impact of Kali Yuga on religious principles.

om namo bhagavate vasudevaya Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, 1st Canto, 18th Chapter, Parikshit, Cursed by Brahmana by verse number 31. eshā kim nivṛtāśeṣā karano militekṣaṇā vruṣā samādhir ahosve kim no sthyākṣātra-bandhubhihi Translation and work part by His Divine Grace, Sri Bhaktivedanta Swamishila Prabhupāda. Translation Upon returning, he began to contemplate and argue with the both in himself whether the sage had actually been in meditation with the sense concentrated and eyes closed or whether he had just been feeing trance just to avoid receiving a lower kshatriya. Parapada A king being a devotee of the Lord did not approve of his own action and thus he began to wonder whether the sage was really in a trance or was just pretending in order to avoid receiving the king. He was a kshatriya and therefore lower in rank. Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong. Srila Vishwanatha Chakravarti Thakura and Srila Jiva Goswami do not believe that the king's action was due to his past misdeeds. The arrangements were so made by the Lord just to call the king back to home, back to Godhead. According to Srila Vishwanatha Chakravarti, the plan was made by the will of the Lord and by the will of the Lord the situation of frustration was created. The plan was that for his so-called misdeed the king could be cursed by an inexperienced Brahmana boy infected by the influence of Kali and thus the king would leave his hearth and womb for good. His connection with Srila Shukadeva Goswami would enable the presentation of great Srimad Bhagavatam which is considered to be a book incarnation of the Lord. This book incarnation of the Lord gives much fascinating information of the transcendental pastime of the Lord like his Rasalila with the spiritual cowherd damsels of Rajabhumi. This specific pastime of the Lord has special significance because anyone who properly learns about this particular pastime of the Lord will certainly be desuited from mundane sex desire and be placed on the path of sublime devotional service to the Lord. The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate the devotee to a higher transcendental position. By placing Arjuna and Pandavas in frustration due to the interview of their cousin brothers the prelude of battle of Urukshetra was created by the Lord. This was so incarnated the sound representation of the Lord Bhagavad Gita. So by placing Arjuna and Pandavas and by placing King Pariksit in an acquired position the incarnation of Srimad Bhagavatam was created by the will of the Lord. Being distressed by the hunger and thirst was only a show because King endured much even in the womb of his mother. He was never disturbed by the glaring heat of Brahmastra released by Ashwatthama. The King's distressed condition was certainly unprecedented. The devotee like Maharaj Pariksit are powerful enough to forbear such distress. Such distress by the will of the Lord and they are never disturbed. This situation in this case was therefore all planned by the Lord. Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Karupada. Hare Krishna. Today's verse is a very very important verse especially those who are practicing Krishna Consciousness. Why and how we will see in this verse? Before that, this verse, before this verse, we know the previous verses. How and what position Pariksit Maharaj came and how he came in. Once Pariksit Maharaj was went to hunt and by the will of the Lord he became fully fatty and thirsty and he entered the Hermitage of King Shamikarushi. And usual general general etiquette or anyone guest comes to our house what we will do? We will give at least at least we will smile at them. Smile at them or give a glass of water or something like that. And also who is who is who is going to where? Is a King, Emperor of the world is going to Hermitage of a Shamikarushi and Rishi, Sage. But what happened is opposite happened there. Because he is unprecedented. That's why in the previous verse also if you see Prabhupada writes is unprecedented events. And as soon as the Pariksit Maharaj went there is no response and Sage was sitting silent in a meditation. And even Pariksit Maharaj is a great Emperor and he was a King. And more than that he was a devotee of the Lord. But situation was totally opposite. Then as as in the previous verses mentioned the will of the Lord the King Pariksit Maharaj become very angry. Very angry. Then what happened? He took a dead snake and put around his shoulder and he came out from the Hermitage. And while coming to his kingdom this happened in this verse is explained. What has happened is explained here. . . Upon returning he began to contemplate. He began to contemplate. That's why he said Prabhupada writes in the purport. The King that being a devotee of the Lord did not approve his own actions. Thus began to wonder whether the Sage was really trans or pretending to order to avoid receiving the King. The translation is saying upon returning he began to contemplate and argue within himself. He is arguing within himself. Whether the Sage had actually been a meditation with the sense concentrated and closed eyes or whether he had just been feeing pretending trans just to avoid receiving a lower Kshatriya. See there is a order lower Kshatriya. He is not saying I am the King. He is feeling a lower Kshatriya. Means Brahmanas are always highly respected. Brahmanas are always highly respected. That is our culture. But here there is a different situation happened. Let us hear. Srimad Bhagavatam is not ordinary literature. Srimad Bhagavatam is a ripened fruit of all Vedic literature. Essence Saram Saram all the Saras are explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. And everything is there in the Srimad Bhagavatam. Everything. Political, economical, social, moral, religious. Everything is there in this Bhagavatam. That is why Bhagavatam is a complete whole. That is why the six questions asked by sages of Naimisharanya in their turn there are six questions I in the previous in the Bhagavatam classes all of us heard the six questions. The first question in the first chapter the first canto 9th was what is the absolute and ultimate good for a people in general. Ultimate good there is no good more than this. That is ultimate good. That is the first question. The second question what is the essence of all scriptures not one scripture all scriptures and third one tell why Krishna the supreme personality of Godhead is appeared. And fourth one tell us the acts of Lord performing relationship creating a material world. And fifth one describe the activities of the incarnation of the Lord. And last question is very very important especially connected to today's verse. Where have religious principle gone after Krishna's disappearance from this planet? Where have religious principles we know religious principles means everyday worship the Lord. People like nowadays spirituality but they don't like religiosity. Why? Because religious means they have to follow some kind of procedures do's and don'ts and all those things. But religious is not like that explained by Srila Prabhupada especially in Srimad Bhagavatam. Religiosity, religion is a different meaning especially in Srimad Bhagavatam. That's why here if you understand this verse where have religious principle gone after Krishna's disappearance

#### Devotional Service, Repentance, Three Modes of Material Nature, Lord's Plan

**Key Quote:** "Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of watching one's thoughts and actions while practicing Krishna consciousness, explaining that pure devotees are above the three modes of material nature and that repentance is a crucial tool for devotees who accidentally commit mistakes, referencing Prabhupada's teachings on the necessity of inner repentance for a Vaishnava.

from this planet. That is asked by sages of Naimisharan in a first canto first chapter 23rd verse. And answer this question Shukadeva, Suta Goswami answers this question in a first canto 3rd chapter 43rd verse. He says bruhi yegeshvare krishne brahmani dharma varnami swamkshata adunopeti dharmakam sharanam gatah It is mentioned since Shri Krishna, the absolute truth master of the mystic master has departed from this own abode, please tell us who is the religious principle has taken. Answer to this question krishne svadhamno bhagate dharmo jnanadivihi saha kalo nasta dharmashe purna krodhunavati vidhi The translation This Bhagavatam Purana is brilliant as a sun and it arises just after departed of Lord Krishna to his own abode. It is a brilliant sun. Brilliant sun means there is no darkness. Brilliant sun. Accompanied by religious not only religious Prabhupada translates knowledge, not only knowledge etc. etc. means morality. Prabhupada explains another place political. Person who has lost their vision due to the dense dark, dense darkness of ignorance is not only darkness, is a dense darkness of ignorance in the age of kali shall get light from this Purana. That's why Srimad Bhagavatam is various verse actually. That's why dharmo nirmastranam satham Bhagavatam begins verse like that. Because dharma, what is actual dharma explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. Here if you see in the verse what we are hearing, the sages came but he didn't respond. King went to hermitage of sage, he didn't respond. It is effect of kali yuga. Beginning of kali yuga. But in this kali yuga, the brilliant sun like Srimad Bhagavatam gives a knowledge and all the required facility one who is serious about spiritual life. That's why Srimad Bhagavatam is very very important. And especially in this verse, it is very very important for all of us to understand especially those who are practicing devotional service. It is mentioned here while returning he began to contemplate and argue with himself whether the sage has actually been meditation with the sense concentrated the eyes closed whether he had been feeing trance just to avoid receiving the kshatriya, lower kshatriya. As I mentioned, Srimad Bhagavatam gives a answers to all our questions with an examples. This is one of the most important examples because Srimad Bhagavatam begins begins with Parikshit Maharaj's past time. As a practitioner of Krishna consciousness we have to watch full of our thoughts. Not only thoughts, our actions also. Not like that, we are practicing Krishna consciousness, we can do whatever we like to do. No. We are above the modes, of all the material natures. No. Krishna says No. What is the last verse of 14th chapter? To get out from the three modes of material nature we have to do means pure unalloyed devotional service we have to do. Then only we can come out from the three modes of material nature. Otherwise, three modes of material nature is very difficult to overcome. That's why Krishna is saying, Daivyesha gunamai mamamaya duratya. It's a my maya. It is not ordinary person's maya. Mamamaya duratya. Maameva prapadyante maya metam tarantite. One who surrendered to Krishna he can be relieved from this three modes of material nature. But, the pure devotee of the Lord is not under the material nature. That is the meaning of pure devotee of the Lord. He is above the three modes of material nature. He will be doing a pure unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. But, Lord will take this pure devotees to teach general people like all of us. That is happening in this verse. In this verse. It is not like Pariksit Maharaj having misdeeds or previous karmas so that he has to suffer by cursing a takshaka word, takshaka snake bite and he will suffer and he will die within seven days. No. It is the will of the Lord. Lord will take this pure devotees for his mission. Like for example, all of us we know the Jaya Vijaya Narsimha Deva past time. It is not like that Jaya Vijaya's are envious of Sanak Kumar and all Kumaras. Not like that. It is a Lord's will. Lord having different plans. In that past time Lord want to fight. With whom he can fight? With ordinary people he can fight? No. He has to fight with whom? His own devotees. Not only his own devotees. Pure devotees. Not only his pure devotees. They should have a competition with Lord. Like Iranya Akshaya and Iranya Kashyapu they are fighting. When Iranya Kashyapu saw the Lord he is the right person to fight today. I didn't get till now right person to fight. See. They are fighting like anything. That is a Lord's plan. That is a Lord. That is why Lord is not ordinary personality. He is a supreme personality of Godhead. He will choose what he want to do. Krishna's material word will work. It is not like that Durga will work her own wills. No. She will work under the direction of Krishna. Everything is moving under the direction of Krishna. Wind blows by the fear of Krishna. And waves from the river stops because of fear of Krishna. That is why Krishna's activities, Krishna's will is not ordinary will. Ordinary will. And especially when he is enacting pastime with pure devotees not ordinary activities. That is why Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita janma karma jame divyam yomaveti tatvatah tektvadeham punajanmam naiti mameti savarjana. Janma and karma activities of Krishna and his devotees is not ordinary. It is a transcendental. It is a transcendental. One who understands this transcendental activities, tatvataha with the truth, then you will never return back to this material world. We have to understand Krishna's very tatvataha. In reality we have to understand. Reality we have to understand. And how reality we have to understand Krishna again explains in Srimad Bhagavad Gita 9th chapter. It is not like that simply by feeling, okay when we go in front of the devotees we will cry after that. Not like that. You have to understand Buddha and Bhava. We should have a feelings and we should have a should have a truth. In a truth we have to understand Krishna. That is why Srimad Bhagavatam is a very very important and especially Srimad Bhagavatam gives a direct answers and direct. Bhagavatam is full of questions and answers. Perfect questions and perfect answers. There is no some different questions and different. No. Perfect questions and perfect answers. And in the especially in this verse if you see the king being a devotee of the Lord did not approve his own actions. He could have thought what I did is correct. But he is thinking and he is contemplating, contemplating. Thus he began to wonder whether this sage is really meditation or he is to avoid this lower Kshatriya. Maybe he is in meditation. He is doing meditation. I disturb him. Or he is want to avoid this lower Kshatriya association. See this is a mood of a king because the king is a devotee of the Lord. Devotees never blame others. Devotees are very humble in nature. They will not expect. Always give respect. And have to think whether it is really mistake happened and what I can do. They will not blame. Even though sometimes past misdeeds also that's why Brahma says, tattenukampam supameekshamanam munjana evatmam kurtam vipakam Even the highest of the highest great calamities happens also will think it is my past misdeeds. It is not because of somebody else. He will not blame anyone else. He will always take responsibility. Because of my past misdeed it happened like this. This is one of the lesson we can learn from this verse. And second, because each and every word and sentence in the Bhagavatam is a lesson for all of us. You can see in this. This is the first line I read in the Parbat. And second. And especially Prabhupada articulate very nicely. And second line. The repentance comes into a mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong. See. Repentance comes to in the mind of a good soul. It is very very important. Each and every word also you have to see. Repentance comes in the mind of a good soul as soon as he commits something wrong.

#### Qualities of a Devotee, Krishna's Mercy, Ajamila's Story, Offenses to the Holy Name
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/RxWcBMs-zpY?t=1200

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Even devotees sometimes commit some sinful activities, either unknowingly or due to past behaviour, but if you sincerely repent, thinking I should not have done this, this Supreme Lord will excuse him."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the qualities of a devotee, emphasizing that elevated character and behavior please the Lord, and highlights the importance of genuine repentance for accidental sins, referencing the story of Ajamila and warning against intentionally committing sinful activities while expecting forgiveness due to chanting the Hare Krishna mantra.

Sometimes repentance. People will also repent. Repent or atone. Sometimes atone also. Some mistake happened I will do something so that I can atone. But that is one way level is correct. Prabhupada explain it. It is called Karmakandya process. But repentance is good for a devotees especially when he commits something wrong. Usually devotees will not do mistake. But accidentally it happens. You have to repent. Prabhupada one more place is explained. Repentance in the Back to Godhead magazine one place Prabhupada explains very nicely. Without Thapa or inner repentance the soul cannot leave as a Vaishnava. In the Back to Godhead magazine. Without Thapa and inner repentance the soul cannot leave as a Vaishnava. Without Thapa and whole process become useless. Without Thapa or heart being impure therefore good friends seek atonement without delay. Without repentance Vaishnava can't leave. That's why the repent is very very important tool for a devotee especially accidentally or sometime he commit a mistake. And one more place in a Srimad Bhagavatam Prabhupada says the devotees are naturally faultless. Accidentally sins committed by the devotee are sincerely regret. And by the grace of the Lord all sins unwillingly committed by the devotee are burnt to ashes in the fire of in the fire of repentance. See all the things will be pushed into fire and burnt into ashes in the fire of repentance. And this is the quality of one more quality of a devotee. There are different qualities. There are 26 qualities of a devotee. Just I like to read that 26 qualities. When Lord Vishnu appeared in front of Prithu Maharaj he glorifies the quality of Lord he glorifies the quality of Prithu Maharaj. Why he is glorified? He says the Lord Vishnu was very pleased with Maharaj Prithu and offered him a good character and behavior and offered him a benediction. The Lord openly says that performing a great sacrifice and undergoing austerity and mystic yoga practices cannot satisfy him. What satisfies the Lord? He is pleased only by elevated characters and behavior. But this cannot be developed unless one become a pure devotee of the Lord. Unalloyed, unflinching devotional service done to the Lord develops a good quality of a spirit soul. The spirit soul is a part and parcel of the Lord. That's what Krishna is saying. That's what Krishna is saying. That's what Prabhupada says. Repentance in the mind of a good soul. Actually soul is always good. Soul is not bad. Soul is a covered. It is like Prabhupada gave an example. It is a knife. Knife if you take it is a corroded, rusted. Knife is bad but when you do rusting if you remove then knife will work nicely. Like our soul also covered with a false ego, all these coverings. But we have to remove that contamination by practicing a unalloyed devotional service. Unalloyed devotional service. That unalloyed devotional service it is all explained in Srimad Bhagavatam through examples like Parikshit Maharaj. That's why Parikshit Maharaj's pastime is a will of the Lord to teach an example for all of us. And one more place in a Vaishnava bhajan because we are all Gaudiya Vaishnavas. One of our great Acharya named Narottama Das Thakur, he says very nicely ... ... ... ... ... Narottama Das Thakur saying repentance for having spoiled his human life and knowingly drunk a poison of material life. The purport is that one certainly becomes addicted to sinful activities when he becomes devoid of this good which is wife when he has lost his good sense does not take to Krishna Consciousness. If we are not taking Krishna Consciousness our good life will be spoiled. That's what Narottama Das Thakur says. That's why after coming to Krishna Consciousness you have to take it this process very seriously by accidentally if something mistake happened we have to repentance and when you do the repentance what will happen? Automatically all the sinful activities will go away. And the Bhakti Yoga is so powerful not only sinful activities are result of sinful activities will go away sinful tendency also burn away from our our mind. That is the power of devotional service. That's why Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's famous instruction very first instruction ... ... ... ... ... ... devotional service is so powerful. Where it is rain ... ... ... ... ... ... .... ... ... ... ... ... This Krishna is available to us very easily. How? Especially in this age of Kali Yuga. kalerdosha nithairajan asti ekamahaguna keetanadeva krishnasya muktasangaparamraje In this age of Kali Yuga, so much degraded age, and that Krishna was departed before in the Dwapar Yuga. But now also he is available. Why he is available? Because he knows Kali Yuga people are mandasumandamatyomandabagyaheupadrutaha They are very dull-headed people, unfortunate. And those people the Lord appeared in the form of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare That's what also explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. Iti shodashakanama kalbhi kalmashanashanam nato paratranaya sarva vedeshu drishyate See, how important Srimad Bhagavatam. And after getting this solution, we should be very carefully receive and carefully practice this. But we commit offences while chanting holy name. Especially we will commit sinful activities or sometimes accidentally by strength of the holy name of the Lord. The sixth offence. Committing an offence at the holy name by committing a sinful activity. That is the most serious offence towards the holy name. Why? Why? Because we know holy name we have to chant very seriously and it will burn away all our sinful tendency. But again we will commit mistake. That's why Prabhupada explains. If ordinary people commit a mistake, government sometimes reduces the punishment and all those things. But any higher officer commit a mistake in a government, what will happen? Nowadays to what will happen all of us we know. Immediately will come eye lights, head lights, whatever lights. All lights will spotlight, brilliant lights will come on them. So much promotion, so much of this one will happen. Because they are in responsible position. They should not do mistake like that. They should not do mistake like that. They should not mistake like that. And after getting to know. Chanting Hare Krishna Mantra is highest of all the religious principles what we can practice. And you should not commit offences. Especially by taking a strength of this holy name. Then what will happen? It's a very grievous offence. That's why we should not commit offence by taking a strength. Okay, I will chant Hare Krishna Mantra and I will eradicate all my sinful activities. No, that is not good. We have to be conscious. We should not commit any offence. And by accidentally if we commit an offence. We have to repent and eradicate offence. That also Prabhupada explains. You have to genuinely you have to repent. Genuinely you have to repent. Even devotee. One more place Prabhupada says very nicely. In the story of Ajamila. Ajamila was a Brahmana. Such a Brahminical culture is born and bought up. But because of association he lost all his Brahminical quality. But he is so fortunate. He is so fortunate. He kept his youngest son name is Narayana. And he got a fortune. At the time of death. And here in the second chants. That is a Prabhupada titles. In the second chants. The chapter name is a story of a real death experience. In that one Prabhupada says. Even devotees sometimes commit some sinful activities. Either unknowingly or due to past behaviour. But if you sincerely repent.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's plan become very easy for us when we follow Krishna's orders."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that King Parikshit's actions were part of the Lord's plan to call him back to Godhead and that understanding these arrangements requires the guidance of acharyas, emphasizing the importance of surrendering to Krishna and following His orders to avoid frustration and receive His mercy, referencing the question asked by sages about where religious principles have taken shelter.

If sincerely repent. Thinking I should not have done this. But I am so sinful. I have again committing this. This Supreme Lord will excuse him. On the basis of genuine repentance. However if. Intentionally commit sinful activities. Expecting that the Lord will forgive him. Because he is chanting Hare Krishna mantra. That is inexcusable. See. It is inexcusable. That is why we should be very very careful. When you are chanting. Especially taking a stent of the Holy name of the Lord. And committing a mistake. Like this. There are so many things Prabhupada explained. How repentance is good for a devotee. To rectify our mistakes. Especially sinful activities. Unknowingly. Especially accidentally. We should not worry. That is what Krishna also explained. Srimad Bhagavatam. Apiche Sudhacharo Sadhurayavetaman. By accidentally. Accidentally if sometime we commit mistake. But he is properly situated. Lord will excuse him. Lord in the heart. Sitting in a. Devotee's heart. He will purify that person. We should not worry. But devotees should be very conscious. We should not commit. We should not do anything and everything. We should be very cautious. In our actions. That is why. Pariksit Maharaj was. What is. Pariksit Maharaj was. Thinking. Whether. This sages. Sorry. The sage was really. Meditation. Or pretending. Or. Is. Not. Don't want to receive. Lower. Rank. Kshatriya. See. He is a introspective. And he is a repentant. I should have not done. Putting a snake like this. Dead snake like this. This is one of the thing. We can learn. Should be introspective. And should be repentant. Of our. Bad activities. And second thing is. The third line. Sheela Vishwanatha. Chakravati. Thakur. And Sheela Jeeva Goswami. Do not believe. That. King's action. Was due to. Most. Fast. Misdeeds. The arrangement. Was so. Made by the Lord. Just to call a king. Back to home. Back to Godhead. See. This is another interesting point. Charge. Charge. Not. Home. Is. Surrounding. The third point. Krishna explained. Sheela Vishwanatha. Chakravati. And Sheela Goswami. Thakur. Thakur. The third point. Krishna explained. Sheela Vishwanatha. Chakravati. And Sheela Goswami. Thakur. The third point. Krishna explained. Sheela Vishwanatha. Chakravati. And Sheela Jeeva Goswami. Do not believe. King's action. Was due to. Past. Misdeeds. Arrangement. Was so. Made by the Lord. Just to call. arraignment by the Lord. And these things, the arraignments and the understandings, we can have only through Acharyas. Otherwise, we may also think, why these devotees also sometimes they will commit mistakes, especially pure devotees like Pariksit Maharaj. But this can be understood properly by the explanation of our previous Acharyas like Vishwanatha Chakravarti and Jiva Goswami. And according to Vishwanatha Chakravarti and Jiva Goswami, he says, in a Prabhupada purport, he says, the plan was made by the will of the Lord and will of the Lord, the situation of frustration was created. By the will of the Lord, the situation and frustration created in the Pariksit Maharaj. And the plan was that for his so-called misdeed, the king would be cursed by inexperienced brahmana boy. Infected by an influence of Kali. And thus, king would leave his heart home for a good, making possible the connection with the Srila Shukadeva Goswami. This connection would enable the presentation of great Srimad Bhagavatam, which is considered to be a book incarnation of the Lord. See, that question asked by sages, where religious principles has taken? And Krishna want to give answer and Krishna already planned. What is the plan? Okay. So, Krishna, he has already planned. What is the plan? He has already planned. He has already planned. What is the plan? He has already planned. He has already planned. He has already planned. He has already said, now Kali Yuga is starting. Dwapara is hinding. Krishna will plan. Then where this religious principle will take? Then Krishna had arrangements. That's why Krishna will do all arrangements for his devotees. And Krishna is always ready to, always ready to reclaim conditioned souls more eager than us. More eager than. That's why Prabhupada says, when you keep one step towards Krishna, Krishna will take how many steps? Thousand steps Krishna will take. And our steps is very small. And how much is Krishna's step? All of us we know Vamana Deva's incarnation. How much is Krishna's steps? One step will cover lower and one step will cover upper. That is Krishna's steps. And it will take thousand steps to show. Because if we keep all these things, because we are not Bali Maharaj to give that kind of shows. And Krishna will show His mercy as we surrender. That's why Krishna is saying in 4th chapter, etam am prapadyente tam stativa bhajamiham. As we surrender, I will reciprocate. If Bali Maharaj is fully atmani vedanam, fully surrendered, that's why He showed this much only covered. And that is Krishna's mercy. That's why Krishna's intervention if we want in our life, we have to fully surrender to Krishna. When you surrender to Krishna, Krishna will reciprocate. That's what Krishna is promising in Srimad Bhagavatam. Krishna is promising in Bhagavad Gita, don't worry, just surrender to me, I will take care. I will take care. Even Krishna is saying, even if you commit mistakes also, don't worry, you were properly situated, I will take care. Kshipram bhavati in the 9th chapter, that's why this 9th chapter of Bhagavad Gita is most confidential knowledge. It reveals all confidentiality in the 9th chapter of Bhagavad Gita. Most confidential knowledge. This verse Apiches Sudacharo, that also comes in 9th chapter. And Krishna is saying, satatam keetayanto mam etantashtra dhrdavata, that also comes in 9th chapter. And after that, kshipram bhavati dharmatma kshantim kshantim. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. So, Krishna is saying, yogakshema maha mahyananya canthayatho, ananya canthayatho, yogakshema maha, always think of me, I will take care of you. Who can give assurance like this? Only Krishna can give assurance like this. And to whom He can give assurance like this? Okay, if He gives also, how many people can practice like this? Those who are pure devotees of Krishna, that's why that chapter ends with, man manam adhbhakto, madhyaji mam namaskuru. For them only it will reveal, even though it is the most confidential, everyone knows 9th chapter is most confidential, but it will not reveal automatically to everyone. Only devotees of Lord Krishna like Arjuna, devotees of Lord Krishna like Arjuna can understand this. That's why, devotional service, Lord already ready to give devotional service. Lord already descended in the form of holy name, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare. Now, whose hand is there to receive Him? It is in our hand, our hand. That's why, we have to be very sincere, serious to receive Krishna. And when you receive Krishna, Krishna will take care all of this. That's why devotees' business is, how to receive Krishna, how to practice Krishna consciousness, Krishna will take care everything. That's why it is mentioned in the verse, the transcendental pastimes of Lord is revealed in the Srimad Bhagavatam, especially Rasalila. Why Rasalila is mentioned here? The gopis not bothered, my husband what he will think, my relatives what he will think. The midnight they left everything and came to dance with Krishna. Why? They know, only surrender to Krishna is a real, real protector. That we can't understand simply by, with our more mundane understanding. Only we have to understand through a Acharya's. That's why Acharya's explanations required. And Prabhupada is saying, just by hearing this pastime, the mundane sexism will be desuded, it will be rejected. We can't, we will not think about that. That is the power of Krishna's pastime. It will burn away all our so-called, not only sinful activities result, sinful tendency also go away from this. That's why this is a transcendental pastime of Krishna explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. And Srimad Bhagavatam not first only explains this, because we will not understand this. From first canto to ninth canto, very nicely explained. What is Krishna? Who is Krishna? What is his activities of Krishna? That's why the questions, if you see, where does the religious principle take shelter? Before that they ask one more intelligent. That's why the sages are not ordinary sages, they are introspective sages. They ask, why Krishna appeared? What is the ultimate goal? Explain the various incarnations of Krishna. Then he asks, where they have taken shelter? Because ultimately Bhagavatam explains where they take shelter and this is ultimately you have to understand. That's what is Srimad Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is a so powerful literature. So powerful literature is a practical demonstration with examples. And one more place, next word. The book incarnation of the Lord gives a much fascinating information that I explained. The pure devotee's mundane frustration meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position. This is another thing we can learn from this verse. The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position. This is another thing we can learn from this verse. The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position. Like our Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, best example. How much struggle he did. He just simply took an Indigo or whatever airlines to go to America.

**Key Quote:** "The pure devotee's mundane frustration is meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, particularly Rasalila, and explains that hearing these pastimes can desuit mundane sex desires, highlighting Srila Prabhupada's example of facing difficulties to establish Krishna consciousness and emphasizing that Krishna uses His devotees as instruments to teach others how to practice devotional service.

No, now we are going to hear about Prabhupada. How much struggle Prabhupada took, with a 70 years old person. elderly person with two heart attacks, leaving a Rundavan in Dhamodari temple and going to for what? To get something from US? No, Prabhupada asked once, one rebutted, Swamiji, why you came to this US? Then Prabhupada said, what did Prabhupada say? Anyone knows? I came here, which you people don't have. That is Krishna Consciousness. And Prabhupada is not simply saying this one. Prabhupada is genuinely saying. That we can see in the song which we are going to sing in the few days, Barokrupa Gaila Krishna. In that one, Prabhupada writes, the translation is like this. The few lines of that verse is mentioned very nicely. Prabhupada said, My dear Lord Krishna, you are so kind upon this useless soul. Who is writing this? Prabhupada is writing. And what about our position? We don't know. My dear Lord Krishna, you are so kind upon this useless soul. But, I don't know why you have brought me here. I don't know why you have brought me here. You can do whatever you like with me. Whatever you like to do, marvabhi, rakvabhi, jyohicchathu mara. That is one of the Prabhupada's words. That is one of the Vaishnava's song. Narottam Das Thakur writes. And second, he says, but I guess, you have some business here. You have some plans here. You have some business here. Otherwise, why would you bring me to this terrible place? Ugrasthani. Anebe yene ugrasthani. Why you brought this plan? Even though I am useless, but you have some purpose, you brought me here. That is the Prabhupada's mode. That is the pure devotees' mode. That's why, to understand this. To understand Krishna's activities and Krishna's intervention in our life, we have to become a pure devotee of the Lord. Otherwise, it is not possible to understand Krishna's activities. And sometimes, we may think also, maybe these are all some stories. No, no, no. When you practice, when you chant Hare Krishna mantra, when you practice Krishna, we ourselves can see. Prabhupada gave example. When you eat food, in order to ask others, whether I am satisfied or not. You can tell this. You yourself can tell, I am satisfied, I am feeling, I am, get rid of angry, angry mood. You can say, that is the meaning of Bhakti Yoga. That is the meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam's essence. That is the thing. Like this, there are so many interesting topics we can understand from this verse. And one more place Prabhupada says very nicely, it says, one more place Prabhupada says. Then the next line. The pure devotee's mundane prestation meant to elevate a devotee to a higher transcendental position. I read this one. The Prabhupada's example, if you see, is so much difficulties. But after that, what Prabhupada achieved. He established 108 temples, 10,000 disciples, not only that time, now also it is going on. Because frustration meant to elevate a devotee in a highest transcendental position. By placing Arjuna, the Pandavas in frustration due to intrigue of their cousin brother, the Lord created a prelude of battle of Kurukshetra. He did this just to incarnate the sound representation of the Lord, that is, Srimad Bhagavad Gita. It is not like Arjuna is a foolish person. No, he is a very intelligent, he is a good Akesha, he is a conquered, he is a so elevated person. But Krishna put him in an illusion to get a Bhagavad Gita. For whom? For all of us. That's why Krishna takes his devotees as an instrument to teach a general mass of people, how to practice the Bhagavad Gita. It is a devotional service. Similarly, the placing King Pariksit in an awkward position, the Lord created the prelude incarnation of Srimad Bhagavatam. In the next point, King Pariksit being distressed by hunger and thirst, he was only a show, because the king is endued much worse even in the womb of his mother, where he was never disturbed by the glaring heat of the Brahmas released by Ashwatthama. Thus, as mentioned above, the king's distressed condition, was certainly unprecedented. All of us, some of us may be knowing or all of us may be knowing, how Pariksit Maharaj got a name Pariksit. How he got? When he is in the womb of mother Uttara, Ashwatthama released a very powerful weapon, Brahmastra. It is a glaring effulgent. Then finally, who protected? Krishna entered and protected. And that time Pariksit Maharaj saw. A person, one who is protecting. As soon as he took birth, he was searching, where is that person? I want to see that person. That's why his name is called Pariksit. And that distress he controlled. What is this small kind of hunger, thirst and all those things? It is simply a show. That's what Prabhupada was saying. It is simply a show. For what it is a show? Because the Srimad Bhagavatam has to come out from this. And Lord wants pariksit maharaj back to home back to godhead that is the purpose behind this that is the purpose behind this and also it is very nicely mentioned the devotees like maharaj pariksit are powerful enough to forbore such distress caused by the will of the lord thus they never disturbed they never disturbed this situation in this case was therefore all planned by the lord the devotees when they put especially pure devotees and they put in this condition distress condition and frustration they'll never get disturbed like prabhupada example so much but you will never disturb never disturb this example once one of our senior devotee was sharing in the bottom class also when prabhupada was traveling in a flight suddenly flight got little jerk and everyone is there stuck and devotee next to prabhupada saw what prabhupada what is the prabhupada action then prabhupada was nicely chanting hare krishna mantra why you have to worry i am complete surrender to you that is a quality of a pure devotee pure devotee like this there are a very nice interesting things we can learn shri mad bhagavatam especially shri mad bhagavatam perverts written by sheela prabhupada sheila prabhupada and one more place prabhupada writes a letter these letters are very powerful prabhupada is write many letters how we can get protection from the lord and how do we engage with this god in depend on the Lord, not only that, how do we inline our life in the plan of the Lord. One letter, one such letter, Prabhupada writes very nicely to his disciple, Mahatma Prabhu, is mentioned, so far you are thinking about things, making so many plans, that is alright. Making so many plans and thinking things is alright, but our first business is Krishna's plan. We may do so many plans, but what is our first business? But our first business is Krishna's plan. That is the only plan and no matter how many schemes we employ to adjust things in this material world, no matter, we can do so many aaj, paaj, all those things, but in this material world, if they have no solid basis in Krishna's plan, they remain merely a dream of pentasmagoria. See, Prabhupada writes letters in such a way that, and next line Prabhupada writes very nicely, so, in this Krishna conscious moment, I am trying, I am training boys and girls all over the world, how to act nicely by practicing serving Krishna in their everyday life, not one day or one time. Everyday life, and whom, boys and girls, everyone, everyone, that is a Krishna conscious moment for everyone, everyone, boys and girls, and next, that is the more important than trying for something which I may like to do, but which will never happen, we may have so many other plans, but we have to inline with Krishna's plan, then automatically everything will be taken care. Just like Prabhupada gave example also, in the letter Prabhupada. Prabhupada writes, just like Sudhama Vipra, he did not want to offer something very small, because he told small what is, we can offer small, but his wife insisted, so he offered Krishna only a small bowl of flat rice, chip rice, and Krishna took it with a great pleasure, with a great pleasure, and when Sudhama Vipra returned to home, to his poor hut, he found a huge palace made of jewels. So, he offered only a small bowl of chip rice, and Krishna took it with a great pleasure, with a great pleasure, and when Sudhama Vipra returned home to his poor hut, he found a huge palace made of jewels. So, the point is that, to make use of what we have, what already we have, that is the most important, and if Krishna sees that, if we are using properly for pleasing him

#### Krishna's Plan, Following Krishna's Orders, Chanting Hare Krishna, Surrender and Prayer
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/RxWcBMs-zpY?t=3000
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna's plan become very easy for us when we follow Krishna's orders."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of aligning with Krishna's plan, which involves chanting Hare Krishna, following the four regulative principles, and associating with devotees, explaining that Krishna understands our position and will help us if we put in the effort to achieve Him, and encouraging listeners to continuously pray for Krishna's guidance and intervention in their lives.

in a loving attitude, loving attitude of devotional service, then Krishna gives very, every facility in reciprocation of love, vocational love, so if you have talent for a musical achievement, that is nice, but if you have nourished some idea of becoming a famous player playing some music, that will become a source of frustration. If you have a plan to please Krishna, that is good, but I want to become a musician for my pleasure, what will happen? That will become a source of our frustration. Frustration, the end. So it is better if you play your music for Krishna, by having very ecstatic kirtans, in your center with a vancure and in this way i have introduced it all of the devotees and so general public as well as will be able to join together cooperatively in the glorification of the supreme personality of godhead not that we shall glorify anyone else let the materialistic operate in their own way but we have got a vaishnavism vaishnavism stand and we should train the general public to accept it and come up to a our platform our process of doing things not we should reduce to their standard see prabhupada is very strict acharya means stick the principles you never deviate you can and that principles also in line with the krishna's plan that's why whatever activity we do we have to in line with the krishna's plan but how do we know it is the krishna's plan and my plan one more later you prabhupada writes very nice he writes prabhupada writes a letter to a mahatma one more devotee jai dev prabhu jai dev prabhu he writes in a 1972 23rd july my dear jai dev please accept my blessings so and so i have noted the content krishna's plan become very easy for us when we follow krishna's orders how do you know krishna's plans when you follow krishna's order sometimes we plan but we don't we plan and others also can plan but difficulty comes when you do execution especially when the order krishna sold krishna said you have to surrender it's like order oh how do you surrender all those things but krishna is the supreme lord you can order and krishna is not only simply ordering he gave an example like a shimad bhagavatam he gave how to practice and how to surrender also he showed exam that's why krishna is a so merciful that's why we chant, E Krishna Karunasindhu Dhinabandhu Jagatpate. He is not ordinary person to give some order and leave. No, no, no. Or blame somebody. No, I told him but he didn't do. No, Krishna gives an order and everything you will plan for the devotees. But depends on your surrenderance. Etamam prapadyantam tam satyapadyantam. You will plan for all the devotees. And here it is mentioned, Prabhupada writes in the letter, Krishna's plan become very easy for us when we follow Krishna's orders. What is Krishna's order? Otherwise what will happen? Otherwise, we are following the Maya's plan and become frustrated at every step. If you are not following Krishna's plan, you have to follow Maya's plan. If you follow Maya's plan, what will happen? You will be always frustrated. Not only always frustrated, every step you will be frustrated. Following Krishna's order means, Prabhupada says, I mentioned in the previous letter, Prabhupada writes, everyday life you have to follow. And in this letter, Prabhupada writes, following Krishna's orders means, chanting daily 16 rounds, following the 4 regulations, 4 rules and regulations, rise early, associate with the devotees, like that. Unless these principles are followed, we cannot expect Krishna's protection. See, why is so important this chanting Hare Krishna mantra, especially 16 rounds, especially following 4 regulatory principles, especially associated with the devotees. These are the most important. Most important. Expect Krishna's protection. Krishna's protection. You should associate it with them, as much as possible. As much as possible. But, like a Sanatana Gosvami, keep your position. That is alright. But, utilize it to make spiritual progress. That is a real thing! Not for satisfying my anchoring and desires. Hope you meet with good health. See, Prabhupada writes. Krishna's plan means, we have to keep our program very consistent. lands, ratings, ratings, that is important. You should avoid Wall Street Scratches. над Krishna's plan means, we have to follow the Krishna's order. What is Krishna's order? Chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, 16 rounds. Oh, we may think, oh, today onwards if I am not chanting 16 rounds, then no protection. No. Krishna understands our position. Krishna understands. Okay. Like, what is Krishna? How Krishna will understand? Krishna demonstrates his proper rights. Okay. Whatever your position, that's what Prabhupada is saying. Whatever you are in a, whatever position you are there, that position you, whatever you have, you offer. Like Prabhupada gave example in Sudhama. You don't have anything. He has only small chipped rice, that is all, flagged rice, that also he was reluctant to give. Who told? His wife told. Please go and offer with love and devotion. And Krishna, what he gave? Palace, all those things he gave. And we can, and we can also hanker like this. Like that? Yes, we can hanker like that also. But Krishna is only, that much only limited? No. What Krishna wants to give? Krishna want to give his love of God. Krishna want to give himself. For that, we have to be pure devotee of the Lord. But we should not worry, oh, I am not pure devotee, what can I do? No. Whatever position we are there, we can offer. Krishna will help. That's why Prabhupada says, God help, those who help themselves. If you are chanting one round, okay. Next, tomorrow I will chant two rounds. If you are chanting two rounds, I will chant four rounds. Then Krishna will help us. God helps those who help themselves. That's why Krishna's protection always will be there. But put an endeavour to achieve Krishna. That is required. That is required. That's why Rupa Goswami says, Ekala laulyam tatra maulyam. Only your eagerness to achieve Krishna, that is required. That's all. Nothing else. You have to put that endeavour. Whatever you are there, put that much effort. Krishna will understand this. Krishna will understand. He will give you necessary intelligence. All the things Krishna will give. But our endeavour should not be stopped. We have to always continuously endeavour. Sometime while chanting, as we discussed, chanting time also, we will have some difficulties to chant and all those things. But we can pray to Krishna. Krishna, this is my position. Please help me. That's what our chanting Hare Krishna mantra. Please engage me in your service. I am engaged in Maya service. Please engage me in your service. Continuously, genuinely pray for Krishna. Then all our sinful tendencies, everything will burn as repentance. As we discussed, the fire of repentance will burn and we become a pure devotee and the guidance of a pure devotee. And we have so many instructions given by Srila Prabhupada. Just you have to follow. Just you have to follow Prabhupada's instruction, chanting Hare Krishna mantra, follow the four glider principle, just coming to temple, take prasadam and our process is… Our penance is very simple. In order to do, climb big big mountains, fasting and all, our fasting is… After immediately fasting, feasting. See, it is very simple. See, feasting. And our program, our morning program, dance, everyday dancing. Not like that when you are at home, no, everyday dancing, everyday, every, every, every, Prabhupada says, if you are ready, you can give, everyday you can celebrate festivals, but we are not ready. Everyday we can celebrate festivals. And we have such a nice literature to read, Srimad Bhagavatam, we have such a nice association of devotees, all our acharyas are exalted devotees, so much literature to read, so many festivals. We have so much of pilgrimage we can go. What else we want? Everything is there in Krishna consciousness. Only we have to show our interest, then Krishna will give all the facilities. That's why we have to surrender to Krishna and pray to the Krishna, Krishna, today onwards at least I am yours. Please help me to take your intervention in my life. Then Krishna definitely give, definitely intervene in everyone's life. Because Krishna's business is only that. That's all. That's all. He said, how to recline this country. That's why Krishna is making so many arrangements for all of us. Temples, he sends a pure devotee, he sends a holy rivers, he sends a literature. Everything Krishna is giving, for us. Because Krishna is so much compassionate. That's why, as I mentioned, He Krishna Karunasvindu Dheenabandhu Jagatpate, Gopeshagopitam Radhakanta Namostute. And that pastimes are explained in Srimad Bhagavatam. And that's why Pariksit Maharaj was never disturbed. It's Krishna's plan. But is there any mistake? from my side? Whether the sage is pretending or is not ready to receive, what is my mistake from my side? That's why the devotee will think, I should not commit any mistakes. Whether if I commit mistake also, I have to repent. And after that what he did? Pariksit Maharaj not simply went to emperor, okay what to do? No. After that he consulted the sages, now within 7 days I am going to die, what shall I do? He associated the devotees. Then he got a finally association of Srila Shukadeva Goswami and a great retreat like Sriman Bhagavatam. Not only he received the mercy, he distributing mercy to all of us in the form of Sriman Bhagavatam through Srila Prabhupada. That is the greatness of devotees and that is the greatness of a especially pure devotees and that is the greatness of the Lord. That's where I will end here. Granta Rasa.

Suta Goswami explained in the second chapter, savipumsan parodharmo eto bhaktir hadokshajai hayato ki aprateta eyaatma supraseedati The ultimate religious principle for all humanity is by which one can render unalloyed devotional service unto Krishna, that devotional service, should be rendered without any motivation, without any interruption. One cannot engage in the devotional service expecting something in return. We cannot do some business with the Lord. That becomes desire, motive. I want some fruit in return. I am engaged in devotional service, therefore I want something in return. That is not called pure devotional service. Pure devotional service is engaged in the service of the Lord without expecting anything in return and without interruption. Constantly one should engage in the service of the Lord. After explaining this importance of Bhagavad Purana in the first six chapters, Suta Goswami began the case study. He explained from this chapter how Pariksit Maharaj heard this Bhagavad Purana attentively from Shukadeva Goswami and engaged in the service of the Lord and went back home, back to Godhead, even in that same very life itself.

**Summary:** This segment narrates the events following the Mahabharata war, focusing on Ashwatthama's revenge and the release of the Brahmastra.

During the Mahabharata war, both Pandavas and Gauravas fought for 18 days. At the end of, almost at the end of 18 days, all people are killed, except few people. From Pandava side, five Pandavas and their sons, five sons, Krishna and Satyaki. From Gaurava sides, Ashrathama, Kripacharya and Krithavarma. Except these people, everyone was killed. So at the 18th day of war, under the direction of Lord Krishna, Bhima broke the thigh of Duryodhana by unfair means. Because he hit on the thigh. Actually, according to the warrior's code, one should not hit anyone below the waist. But he cannot be killed by any other means. Therefore, Krishna told, should kill him by unfair means. Therefore, under the direction of Krishna, Bhima broke the thigh of Duryodhana. Duryodhana fell down and he was writhing in pain. That time, Ashrathama came and saw the precarious condition of his master, Duryodhana. And he heard from Duryodhana that he was beaten by Bhima by unfair means. After hearing this, Ashrathama became very much angry. Then he decided to put an end to Pandava dynasty. Then, thereafter, with help of Krithavarma and Krishapacharya, went to the camp of Pandava in the middle of the night. And he massacred the five sleeping sons of Draupadi. After that, he took the heads and went in the presence to his master in order to please Duryodhana. But Duryodhana was not pleased by seeing the killing of five sons of Draupadi. When Draupadi came to know, when she heard that her sons were massacred by, killed by, murdered by Ashrathama, she became very much afflicted. And she was overwhelmed with anxiety. And she was, she began to cry. And her eyes were full of tears. When Arjuna saw his wife, Draupadi was crying. Then he came and said, said, my dear Draupadi, please don't worry, don't cry. I'll go and cut the head off of that Ashrathama and bring and give it to you. After that, you can burn the bodies of your sons and take your bath standing on the head of Ashrathama. After saying this, Arjuna and Krishna set out to follow Ashrathama. Then they are going with great speed to chase, chase Ashrathama. When Ashrathama saw that Krishna and Arjuna were coming at a great speed, and he started going little more further. But by the will of providence, his horses were tired. It could not go further. So he saw that his life is in danger now. Immediately, because he does not, he didn't know anything to do. Because of, his life was in danger. Therefore, he had a weapon, ultimate weapon named Brahmastra. Then, he had to release the weapon to protect himself. But he did not know how to retract the weapon. So, as soon as he released the weapon, Brahmastra, fire started blowing everywhere. It was so fierce that Arjuna thought even his life was in danger. Immediately, he took shelter of Krishna. He asked Krishna, My dear Krishna, how is this danger effulgence spreading all around? Where does it come from? I do not understand. Please let me know. After hearing from Arjuna, Krishna said, My dear Arjuna, this is the act of Ashwatthama. Because his life was in danger, he helplessly released his weapon, Brahmastra, to protect himself.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, only another Brahmastra can counteract this weapon."
**Summary:** This segment describes Arjuna's response to Ashwatthama's Brahmastra and introduces the concept of cosmic annihilation.

But he did not know how to retract the weapon. Therefore, only another Brahmastra can counteract this weapon. Since you are very expert in military science, you can use your weapon to subdue this weapon. After hearing this, Arjuna circumambulated Supreme Lord and he released his own weapon, Brahmastra, to counteract Ashwatthama, Brahmastra. When the two Brahmastras joined, extreme heat produced. It was so fierce, it covered entire universe, all planets. Then all the population of the entire three worlds was scorched by the excessivity of this combined weapons of Brahmastra, combined Brahmastra. Then everyone thought our life is finished. Everyone was reminded of Brahmastra. The Samvartaka fire which takes place at the time of cosmic annihilation. Because they thought our life is finished, over. So, Prabhupada says, what is this annihilation? The heat produced by this Brahmastra resembles the fire exhibited in the sun globe at the time of cosmic annihilation. In Bhagavatam, it is described there are four kinds of annihilation. One is called Naimithika. Second is called Prakthika. And third is called Athyantika. And the fourth one is called constant annihilation.

And Mahakalpa, creation of all the material elements along with Lord Brahma, that is called Mahakalpa. So, during the night of Brahma, so this is the day time of Brahma's 432 crores of years and the same as the night time, 12 hours, 12 hours. So, during the day time of Brahma, one annulation happens. That is called occasional annulation. Occasional annulation. During this annulation, all the three planets meet with destruction. All the living entities enters into the body of Lord Narayana. Even Lord Brahma also goes to the body of Narayana. He sleeps there. When he wakes up, he comes out of the body of Narayana and all the living entities will come out and accept according to the different desire, accept different bodies according to the past desires in the previous night of Lord Brahma, previous day of Lord Brahma. This is called one annulation. And second is called total annulation. Total material annulation. That happens at the life time of Brahma. One day of Brahma is 864 crores of years. One life time of Brahma is like that Brahma will live 100 years. That means 864 crores multiply into 30, multiply into 12, multiply into 100. So, put together, Brahma will live for 3.11 trillion years. years, not million, not billion, trillion years. That is the lifespan of Brahma. At the end of the lifespan of Brahma, one annihilation happens. That is called cosmic annihilation. This is what is mentioned here, that annihilation. Cosmic annihilation. Then one more annihilation called Athyantika. A person, when he understands, when he attains the transcendental knowledge, he knows, he distinguishes between the relative truth from the absolute truth. He understands that I am not this body. I am the part and parcel of the supreme person that I have guarded. Therefore, he engages in devotional service and gives up this body. That giving up the body is called Athyantika. That means final annihilation. Annihilation of this material body. This is third annihilation. And fourth annihilation, at every moment, time, invariably transforms the body of all created beings. Krishna also says in Bhagavad Gita, Dei nosmini etade, kaumaram yavanam jara, tada tehyantra praptir, dheras tatra namu yati. The soul passes from youth, childhood to youth, youth to old age. Similarly, it passes at death and enters into another body. How? Because the time changes our body. What body we had yesterday, we don't have the same body now. What body we will have tomorrow, that is different. So time, invariably, transforms all the created bodies of this material world. This causes, this transformation causes the living entity, takes birth, and, again dies. Constant annihilation of birth and death. This is the fourth annihilation.

**Summary:** This segment details the process of cosmic annihilation, including the drought, fire, wind, and rain, and the merging of elements.

So to get out of this all annihilation, what one should do, Sw tych Goswami says, one should hear the nectarian pastimes of Lord Krishna, submissively. That is the only suitable boat to cross over the ocean of material existence. Submission to the Lord Buddha, which is the only suitable boat to cross over the ocean The cosmic annulation, second annulation in detail. At the end of Brahma, as annulation approaches, there will be no rain at all. Therefore, there will be completely drought which takes place. Because of drought, there will be no food grain. Because of that, people will starve to death. And they will not have anything to eat. Father will kill son and eat because there is no food. And son will kill father and eat. Like that, people will eat one another. Gradually, the population will become nil. And after this, the sun in its annihilating form drinks all water from the ocean and from the living entities. Our bodies also contain some water. So, the son will take away all the water from the bodies and take away water from the earth. Its' completely dry. Because of that, sun will illuminate such a huge heat. And after this, there will be a fire from the mouth of ananta at the bottom of the universe. Due to the fire of ananta, the whole universe will burn, from the top blazing sun's, from the bottom. Due to the fire of ananta, the whole universe will burn, from the top blazing sun's, from the bottom. from the bottom, the fire of Ananta Deva. Because of the combined fire, the universal shell will burn like a ball of cow dung. It will grow like a burning of cow dung. After this, there will be heavy wind. It will take place for 100 years. Then after that, there will be heavy rain for 100 years. Due to this heavy rain, the whole shell of universe will be filled with water. Will be filled with water. Then after that, as this water is filled in the universe, the earth, deprived of its quality of fragrance, it merges with water. And the water, deprived of its quality of taste, merges with fire. Fire, it doesn't degrades the quality of form. It merges with air. Air will merge with ether. Ether will merge with false ego. False ego will merge with Ma Tattva. Ma Tattva will merge with the Supreme Lord, Ma Vishnu. This is the way that cosmic annihilation occurs. So at the time of cosmic annihilation, all the material elements and Lord Brahma, even as everything goes to the Lord Brahma, everything goes to the Lord Brahma. Everything goes to the body of Ma Vishnu. When Ma Vishnu breathes out, all the universe comes out from the body of Ma Vishnu. When breathes in, all the universe goes inside

the body of Ma Vishnu. Just when we breathe out, breathe in, how much time it takes? Maybe 3 seconds or 4 seconds or 5 seconds. So the breathe out and the breathe in time of Lord Ma Vishnu is equal to 3.11 trillion years. That is the lifespan of Brahma. Compared to eternal life, that is very, very insignificant. Just like we keep on breathe out, breathe in. It's very, very insignificant. Compared to eternal life, this 3.11 trillion years of Brahma is very, very insignificant. This is the one annihilation, cosmic annihilation. So next, Prabhupada says, The energy produced by Brahmastra is very, very insignificant compared to the energy produced by Brahmastra. Because these atomic weapons can destroy at most one city or one country or some portion of the world. But it cannot destroy everything. Whereas the Brahmastra can destroy the entire universe. So Prabhupada compares between Brahmastra and the modern atomic bomb and the Brahmastra of The golden days. 희 And Britain and France want to take revenge against Germany. Therefore, they attacked Germany. Then Hitler took the support of Japan and other countries to attack them. Then France and Britain took the support of the US and other countries. Hitler is the cause of the Second World War. It happened for six complete years. From 1939 to 1945. Because of the war, millions of people were killed. Millions of people were killed. And so many buildings were damaged. And although the President of America warned Japan to surrender, they did not surrender. They wanted to capture power. They had a lot of power at that time. Military power. A lot of military strength. Therefore, they were re-puffed up. They did not want to surrender. Then the American President gave the order to finish Japan. After receiving the order, they dropped one atomic bomb.

**Key Quote:** "Demons engage in Mugra Karma that is meant to destroy the world."
**Summary:** This segment criticizes the development of nuclear weapons and describes the punishment for leaders who harm innocent people.

So, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, The demons, those who have no knowledge about God, they do not understand that God is in control. They take shelter of false conclusion. And who have lost themselves and who have no intelligence. They engage in horrible things. They engage in horrible, unbeneficial work. Meant to destroy the world. Demons engage in Mugra Karma. That is meant to destroy the world. So, today, we are all proud of nuclear weapons. As soon as one country manufactures some nuclear weapons, they will go and test. As soon as it is successfully fired out, then they think our mission is successful. And we are proud of inventing nuclear weapons. But at any time, the war can take place. Just like Hitler, one person caused the world war. Similarly, at any moment, because of false ego of one person, one president, the world war can take place and it will give, it will create total havoc in the world. So, the invention of nuclear weapons are not meant to give peace and prosperity to the world. But to give disturbance and destruction to the world. This bombs which were put by Americans, it killed so many innocent people. A king, it is said in the Bhagavatam, a king or administrative head or the president or prime minister of the country, if they kill an innocent person or if they give a punishment to a Brahmana, unnecessarily, they will be taken to the hell. By the Yamutadas. The hell called Shukramukha. In that hell, what they will do? The Yamutadas take the king and put inside the rollers. Put inside the, just like a sugarcane will put on the rollers. It will skews. Juice will come out. And that sugarcane will come out. Similarly, the person who kills an innocent person. It will be put inside the rollers and will make him complete chutney. And the body will come out and again they will put. Like that, because the person will not die. The person will not die. Although they give severe punishment, the person will not die at all. They will feel the pain severely, but they will not die. So, again and again, they will take and put. This is the result of punishing a faultless person.

It is said in the Manu Samhita, There are people in the country. The people, sometimes they may engage in pious activity or impious activities. King will share one-sixth. King will get one-sixth share of either pious activity or impious activities. He will get one-sixth share. In this world, more or less, all people will perform sinful activity. Therefore, king will get one-sixth share. Just like in the country, suppose 1200 murders happens in a year. So, the prime minister or head of state will get the reaction of 200 murders. Although, he might have not done. Because people, when they do, he will get the reaction. This is very very responsible post. Nowadays, people do not know. Even there are so many rapes happens. So many things, people loot many things. King will get or the prime minister or chief minister will get one-sixth share of this reaction. At the same time, suppose he sees the people are chanting Hare Krishna Mantra. 12000 people are chanting Hare Krishna Mantra. 16 rounds in the country. He will get the benefit of. He will get the benefit of 2000 people chanting Hare Krishna Mantra. That means, 2000 into 16 rounds, how many rounds? That many. 32000 rounds. Benefit, he will get, although he does not chant. So, this is the duty of king to see that people are engaged in religious principles. They are devoted to the Lord. Nowadays, people, they do not see. They always engaged in great karma activities. Therefore, all of them are assured to go Shukram Ka. To become chutney.

#### Brahmastra, living entities on other planets, soul's qualities

**Verse References:** BG 2.20
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Newcomers, General public
**Key Quote:** "The soul is unbreakable, insoluble, it cannot be burnt, it cannot be dried."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the effects of the Brahmastra on other planets and argues that life exists throughout the universe, citing the qualities of the soul.

And second Prabhupada says, in the second point. This heat produced by the Brahmastra, it created severe impact on all other planets. Everyone was scorched by excessive heat. They felt excessive heat. Who will feel the excessive heat only? Living entities can feel. Here Prabhupada says, in other planet. There are full of living entities. Whereas, the less intelligent people think. There are no living entities in other planets. Only earth has got living entities. It is repeated in Bhagavad Gita. Krishna says, in Bhagavad Gita, about the qualities of soul. achyedyayum, adhayayum, akhileshiyo, shyoshyayavacha nityasarvagatastanur, acaloyam, sanantana The soul is unbreakable. Insoluble. It cannot be burnt. It cannot be dried. The soul is eternal. Sarvagata. All pervading. Soul present everywhere. Soul present everywhere. It is unchangeable. Eternally the same. Here, Krishna uses the word Sarvagata. Sarvagata means, the living entities spread all over the creation of the Lord. Therefore to say, there are no living entities in other planets. In other planet is completely wrong. People nowadays, modern scientists or people those who are interested in creating, inventing something new thing. They want to see what is going on in other planet. Therefore, they send people. They are trying to send people to moon planet. They could not achieve any success. They brought some dust finally. By spending millions of dollar. Now they are spending much more. Millions of dollar to go to Mars planet. To bring more dust. Because we don't have any dust. So, people unnecessarily, they engaged in trying to find something. Here from Bhagavatam, Bhagavad Gita, we can clearly see that every planet has got full of living entities. This body is made of earth, water, fire, air, ether. Our bodies are predominantly made of earth. The living entities which live in the water, made of, predominantly made of water. So, similarly there are birds. Predominantly made of air. So, living entities living on the land, in the earth, in the water, in the air. Why not in the fire? Because they have got the body, suitable body to live in the fire. So, to say there is no living entity in the sun planet is wrong. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita. 4th chapter. In the beginning, I spoke this science of self realization to sun god Vivasvan. Krishna cannot speak to some in person. When we speak, we have to speak to person. I can't speak to wall. Krishna spoke this instruction to sun god Vivasvan. When the king is there, naturally, people also will be there. So, to say there are no living entities in the sun planet is wrong. Otherwise, Krishna would not have said this. He would not have said in Bhagavad Gita, Sarvagata. The living entities are not there in other planets, the word becomes meaningless. Sarvagata means living entities present everywhere. The people, those who are less intelligent, they do not understand that there are living entities even on other planets.

#### atomic energy, supreme will of the Lord, five causes of action, devotional service

**Key Quote:** "Without his will or sanction, nothing can be built up or destroyed."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that the Lord's will is supreme and discusses the five factors necessary for completing an action, highlighting the importance of devotional service.

So, in the next point Prabhupada says, The atomic energy is not powerful enough to destroy the world. And secondly, ultimately, it all rests on the supreme will of the supreme lord. Because without his will or sanction, nothing can be built up or destroyed. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, There are five causes to complete an action. Five factors to be considered. To complete or perform an action. Arjuna, it is said in the Vedanta, there are five causes to accomplish an action. They are, Adhishtanam, the body. Kartha, the doer or performer. Karanam, the senses. Cheshta, endeavor. Daivam, the supreme will of the supreme lord. That is, will of the super soul within our heart. The body is meant to... The Adhishtanam is the body. And Kartha means the doer or the soul. The soul performs an activity that brings reaction. The soul, as God desire, therefore, it wants to perform an activity. When we perform some activity, naturally we get the reaction of the activity. And how to perform the activity? The soul uses the senses. Without senses, we cannot perform an activity. Even senses are used for that we should put an endeavor. Unless we put an endeavor, we cannot accomplish an action. Just like when we do a business, we should put an endeavor. Not just simply sit and roam and sleep. We should put an endeavor to complete the activity. Even though we may put an effort, still we may not be successful. Why? The supreme will of the lord is important. If the lord does not will, we may not attain success. Therefore, the will of... We should always depend upon the will of the lord. Those who are in Krishna consciousness, even though they perform activity, they do not get any reaction for the activity. Because they act under the direction of Krishna. Just like a military man. He kills the people in the battle. But he does not get any reaction. Rather, he is awarded. Rather, he is awarded. He is recognized by government. Why? Because he did the activity under the direction of his authority. Similarly, if we perform an activity in devotional service under the direction of Krishna, we will not get any reaction. Rather, we will be recognized by the supreme lord. After that, we will go back home, back to Godhead. Because we follow the authority of Krishna. We follow the supreme authority. Therefore, we should always depend upon the will of the lord.

#### Prithrasura and Indra, dependence on the Lord, opulence, devotional service

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If one is a devotee of the Lord, if he depends on the Lord in every respect, if he depends on Lord Vishnu in every respect, for him, opulence, victory, peace of mind, all are guaranteed."
**Summary:** This segment narrates the conversation between Prithrasura and Indra, emphasizing the importance of depending on the Lord and how He sometimes removes opulence to encourage devotion.

Depend on the mercy of the lord. In this context, I would like to narrate the conversation happened between Prithrasura and Indra. Indra, he accepted Vishwaroopa as his spiritual master, because he lost his kingdom. Demons came and took away his kingdom. Therefore, he accepted Vishwaroopa. With the help of Vishwaroopa, he got back his kingdom. And after that, Indra killed Vishwaroopa. Because Vishwaroopa was inclined towards even demons. Therefore, he does not want to lose position. Again, demon can come and take away the kingdom. Therefore, he killed Vishwaroopa. Vishwaroopa's father, Veshtha, performed some sacrifice. He wanted to produce a son by which he can kill Indra. Because when he was chanting a mantra wrongly, wrong pronunciation, instead of the son will begat to kill Indra, he will be killed by Indra. Because he chanted, pronounced little wrong, wrongly. Therefore, he got the opposite result. Prithrasura was born. Then he wanted to take revenge against Indra. Because he killed his brother. So, both of them were fighting. That time, Prithrasura said to Indra, O Indra, if one is a devotee of the Lord, if he depends on the Lord in every respect, if he depends on Lord Vishnu in every respect, for him, opulence, victory, peace of mind, all are guaranteed. All are guaranteed. Sanjaya also says in Bhagavad Gita, Yatra Yogeshwara Krishna, Yatra Partho Dhanurdhara, Tatrasir Vijayabhoothir, Dhruvanithir Mathir Mama. Wherever Krishna is there, opulence, victory is certain. So, the same thing, Prithrasura said to Indra, whoever depends on Lord Krishna, in every respect, he will attain everything. For such a person, has nothing to worry in this world. He can get everything. But Lord Krishna is so kind to such a devotee, he will not give any opulence. He will take away the opulence from the devotee. Because that opulence gives an amper to his devotional service. Therefore, Lord takes away the opulence of the devotees, and leaving like a beggar.

#### Krishna's mercy, detachment, Vrithasura's devotion

**Key Quote:** "If at all I favour anyone, especially favour to anyone, first of all, I will take away all his riches, and make him beggar."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Krishna favors devotees by taking away their riches to increase their dependence on Him, using the example of Vrithasura.

So, once Krishna said to Yudhishthira Maharaj, same thing, yasyam anugrunaami harishye tadhanu shanahi, tadodhanum tyacinti yasya svajana dukkha dukkhidam. Krishna said to Yudhishthira, my dear Yudhishthira, if at all I favour anyone, especially favour to anyone, first of all, I will take away all his riches, and make him beggar. So that his wife, his children will kick him out. Thereafter, he will suffer misery after misery. When somebody is in misery, they will always depend on Krishna. Somebody gets some opulence, they will forget Lord. Therefore, Krishna makes sure that, that devotee should always depend on me. Suppose some devotees, even though they are rich, they still can remember Krishna, just like a Sudama. Krishna awarded full riches to Sudama, much more than Indra. But still, Sudama did not forget Krishna. Our case is different. If Krishna awards all riches, we will completely forget Krishna. Therefore, Krishna will not give any riches. Even if you want to become rich, we will put an end to that. Krishna will make sure that, that will not be successful. Because Krishna wants us back home, back to Godhead. He does not want to leave us here, to suffer in this material world. So, this is one point. So, Vrithu also said, Indra, I want to give up everything. I wish to give up everything for the service of the Supreme Lord. I don't want anything in this material world. I want to completely get detached from family, wife, children, society. Relatives. I want to make friendship with only devotees. See the demons. Although he was born as a demon, because he exhibited the quality of pure devotee. He said, Indra, I don't want to go to heavenly planets. I don't have any desire to go to heavenly planets. Nor I have a desire to go to Droloka. Nor I have a desire to go to Brahmaloka. I don't want even liberation. Nor do I aspire to have an unconquerable position, unconquerable position in this world, to rule the people. I don't want anything. Simply I want to engage in the service of the Lord. And he indirectly said, Indra, actually you are fool number one. Because Lord sided with you to defeat me. Lord sided with you to defeat me. Actually, I am not at all defeated. Although I know, I will be killed in this battlefield. But still, after this body, immediately I will go back home, back to Godhead. And I will enjoy. Whereas you suffer. Whereas you suffer in this material world. Overperforms Tabasya, you will get BP. And you will get lot of disease. You have to suffer. Not me. See, the Vrithasura had complete dependence on Lord. Even though, see, killing on the battlefield, particularly getting defeat on the battlefield, somebody will feel worried. But Vrithasura was completely happy. Because he knows, whatever Lord does, it is a benefit for me. Good for me. He is assured of going back home, back to Godhead. Although Indra killed him, practically he was defeated. In one sense. But still, it is Vrithasura who won. Because he went back home, back to Godhead, even in the same life. So, the will of Lord is important.

#### material nature's law, Lord's supervision, Jayadratha

**Key Quote:** "The material nature is working under my direction, producing all moving and non-moving beings."
**Summary:** This segment explains that material nature works under the Lord's supervision and introduces the story of Jayadratha.

Therefore, we should always depend on the will of Lord. One more point, Prabhupada says here, material nature's law, works under the direction of Lord. As confirmed in the Bhagavad Gita. The Lord says there, that natural laws work under His supervision. The world can be destroyed only by His will, of the Lord. And not by the whims of tiny politicians. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, mayadakshinaprakati soyate sacharacharam hetunane kaunteya jagadvipari vartade The material, he says to Arjuna, Arjuna, this material nature is working under my direction. Producing all moving and non-moving beings. Under its rule, this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again. Although Lord creates everything, still, He is aloof from all the material activities. He does not do any activity. He is aloof from all the material activity. He is just only a director. He does not get involved in work. But his activities are conducted by the modes of material nature. Just like a CMD of the organization, personally, does not get involved in work, per se. But he gives direction to his subordinates, directors. In turn, they give direction to managers, supervisors. So, they work. Similarly, Krishna does not do any activities personally. Simply enjoys with his devotees. He gives direction to demigods. They act under the direction of Krishna. They do not act independently. Demigods do not act independently. But they act under the direction of Krishna. Krishna sometimes, personally, controls the material nature. Just for the sake of devotees. In this context, I would like to narrate a small story in Mahabharata. It may take 5 to 10 minutes. Once Jayadratha, Jayadratha was the husband of Dushala. Dhrithastha had 100 sons. One daughter, Dushala. She got married to Jayadratha. Jayadratha was going to meet Shalva to get his daughter married.

**Summary:** This segment narrates the story of Jayadratha abducting Draupadi and the Pandavas' pursuit.

That time, Pandavas were in exile in one vana, one forest. So, he was going. And he saw the cottage. He saw Draupadi standing in the cottage, in his house. When he saw the beauty of Draupadi, he was completely captivated by the beauty of, splendorous beauty of Draupadi. Immediately, he told his friend, Kotika, my dear friend, you please go and find out who she is. This Kotika came and asked Draupadi, so, I am so and so, I have been sent by, I have been sent by Jayadratha. So, she told, she replied, responded to his question. Actually, I am not supposed to speak to anyone, anyone other than my husband. Still, I will answer your question. Then she told, I am daughter of Draupada. I got married to five sons of Pandavas. They have gone out. Please wait for some time. They will return and they will receive nicely. This person went and told Draupada, sorry, Jayadratha, so and so. Then Jayadratha came and when he saw the beauty, again, some more he want to carry away her, because so beautiful Draupadi was. Then he said, Draupadi, why you are suffering so much in this forest? Better, you marry me. You come with me. You can enjoy royal opulence. Surrounded by so many mates, why you are suffering here? Your husbands are beggars. Husbands are beggars. An intelligent woman follows her husband in prosperity. When he is rich, woman follows. He is giving, who Jayadratha is telling to Draupadi. Intelligent woman follows her husband in prosperity. And he rejects him. And she rejects him in adversity. Whenever husband is, means he doesn't have any money, wife will reject. That is intelligent woman. Therefore you be intelligent. You come with me. You can enjoy with me. These people are beggars. What enjoyment you can get? As soon as she heard this statement from Jayadratha, she was shocked and said, you rascal, shut your mouth and get lost from here. Then Jayadratha became very angry. Then he forcibly caught hold of Draupadi and put on his chariot and started taking to his capital. When he was taking, Yudhishthira was little far away. He was in the forest. And he saw some birds, animals are agitated. And they started moving here and there. So he could understand there is some calamity. Therefore Pandava was immediately rushed to the cottage. When they saw, Draupadi was not there. They were informed by housemaid that Jayadratha came and forcibly took away Draupadi. He has gone this direction. Please go and immediately catch him. So he went this way. And he started catching. So Pandavas immediately followed the same direction to catch Jayadratha. So he had some army also. So Pandavas saw and killed all the people. So when Jayadratha saw that all his army was completely vanquished, he put Draupadi down and started escaping. Because somehow he wanted to save his life. So when Bhima saw this, Draupadi was there. And he told Yudhishthira, Yudhishthira, you take Draupadi home. I will go wherever he goes. I will finish him today. Even if he goes to heavenly palace, I will not leave him. Today is finished. So then Yudhishthira said, No, no, please don't do this. Because he is Gandhari's son-in-law. Our sister's husband. If you kill him, Mother Gandhari will lament. Therefore please don't kill him.

**Summary:** This segment describes Jayadratha's humiliation, his tapasya to please Lord Shiva, and Dronacharya's formation of the Chakraviya.

But still Arjuna and Bhima followed Jayadratha. At last Bhima went and caught Jayadratha. He gave a nice beating. He was about to kill. That time Arjuna said, See, do you remember what Yudhishthira said? Please don't kill him. Then he has to follow his brother's word also. He took a knife and shaved his head here and there. Shaving the head here and there, left some hair here and some portion shaved. That is as good as killing. In the Shastra, shaving the head of the person here and there is as good as killing. After shaving the head, he tied him nicely like an animal and brought him to the cottage of Pandavas and left to Yudhishthira and Draupadi. If at all you are interested to lead life, want to be alive, then you declare yourself as a slave of Yudhishthira. Then you leave. Immediately when Yudhishthira saw this Jayadrila was bound by like an animal, he told Bhima, let him free. So then he removed all the ropes. Then Yudhishthira instructed, My dear Jayadrila, please don't do this kind of activities and all. No, you please go anywhere as you wish. So he let him free. Then Jayadrila was completely humiliated. He put his head down in shame. Then he went to forest to perform tapasya. So he performed severe tapasya to please Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva was pleased. Then Lord Shiva asked, My dear Jayadrila, I am very much pleased with your tapasya. Please ask any benediction. Then Jayadrila asked, I want to defeat all the Pandavas one day in the battlefield. Lord Shiva said, It's impossible. Because Krishna is there. As long as Krishna is there, nobody can defeat Pandavas. However, I will give one benediction. That you can defeat the Pandavas except Arjuna in the crucial time of war. So he gave this benediction to Jayadrila and went. So in the Mahabharata war, thirteenth day of war, so Bhishma fell down. Arjuna started massacring all the Gauravariyas. When Duryodhana saw this, all the soldiers who had sacrificed everything for his sake were mercilessly killed by Arjuna. Pandavas. Therefore he went and told Dronacharya, My dear Dronacharya, see you are very very lenient. You don't want to fight wholeheartedly with Pandavas. Because of your lenience in the battle, all my people are killed. It was like insulting for Dronacharya. Because he is trying to find fault in the loyalty of Dronacharya. Then Dronacharya said to Duryodhana, Duryodhana you are actually you are insulting me. I am doing my duty properly. But you are not understanding. As long as Krishna is there, nobody can defeat. This is the law. Still, however, today I will kill one of the leading warriors in the battlefield. Provided, if you take away Arjuna from my presence. So next day, just another three, four minutes I will take. Okay? So next day, Dronacharya formed circular formation. Chakraviya. Chakra-Yuha. So, Duryodhana directed some people to take away Arjuna from the battlefield. So Arjuna was taken away. Rest of the Pandavas were there. Yudhishtha, Bhima, Nakula, Sahadeva, all people. Arjuna was not there. He created Chakraviya. Chakra-Yuha.

Dronacharya. This Chakraviya, only four people can penetrate. One is Krishna. They know how to penetrate. Go inside. By Krishna, his son Pradyumna, Arjuna, and Abhimanyu. Nobody knows. None of the Pandavas knows except Arjuna and Abhimanyu. So, Yudhishtha and all Pandavas tried to enter. Tried to penetrate. But Drona just drove them away. All the people came back. Then immediately, Yudhishtha went and asked Abhimanyu. My dear Abhimanyu, only you know how to penetrate. Please, go. We'll follow you. Don't worry. He said, my dear uncle, I know only how to go inside. I don't know how to come out. If I, something happens, some danger happens, I don't know how to come out. He said, don't worry. We'll follow you. Then, Abhimanyu went inside and started creating heavy damage to the Kaurava warriors. He killed so many people. By seeing the superhuman feet of Abhimanyu, the warriors, their hair stand on the head. By seeing the superhuman feet of Abhimanyu, all the people started running here and there. That time, they were following, Pandavas were following. That time, Jayatra came in front of all Pandavas. He did not let them allow. Because he got the boon to defeat. So, he took the chance to defeat all the people. Abhimanyu went inside and he was caught inside. All the great people joined together killed Abhimanyu. Although, sunset happened already.

If I do not fulfill my vow, then, I'll enter fire. I'll commit suicide. Then, after that, next day, so, Jayatrita heard this. That Arjuna took the bow. That, I'll be finished today.

**Key Quote:** "As we surrender to Lord, Lord will also reciprocate."
**Summary:** This segment describes how Krishna uses his mystic power to protect Arjuna and ensure Jayadratha's death, emphasizing the importance of surrender to the Lord and following the instructions of the guru.

Then, immediately, went and told Duryodhana. Today, I'll go home. You take care of your fight. I'll not fight. Because, if I'm there, I'm finished today. Duryodhana said, no, no, don't worry. Because, big, big people, you don't come in the front. Far away, 100 miles far away, be there. Arjuna cannot come at all. Certainly, he has to commit suicide today. So, they were overjoyed by hearing this. Bow took by Arjuna. So, next day, then, Arjuna started fighting, fighting, fighting. Time was almost come. Son was about set. Still, he was far away. Then, Krishna thought, how to protect my devotees. Then, Krishna used his mystic power to kill Arjuna. So, as soon as son was set, all the people became, all the Gauravas became overjoyed. Today, Arjuna is finished. He has to commit suicide by entering fire. That time, he was off-guarded. Who? Jayatrada put his weapon and came out. And, thinking that, I'm saved, Arjuna is finished. Immediately, Krishna removed his mystic power. Son is there. Arjuna cut the head of Jayatrada. So, Arjuna used his Pashupada weapon which was given by Lord Shiva. Before releasing weapon, Krishna said, the birth of Jayatrada. When he was born, the voice from the sky said to his father, your son will be glorious. He will bring glorious to your dynasty. However, in the battle field, one hero will cut off the head of your son. After hearing this, the father of Jayatrada called on Arjuna to kill his son. Then, he told, whoever causes my son's head to fall down on the earth, his head will burst into 100 pieces. This, he told, who? Krishna told Arjuna, you should cut off the head and the head should go to his father's lap. Because, his father was performing evening prayer, offering near to that area. One lake was there. There, he was sitting and performing evening prayer. He told, use your celestial weapon, you cut the head of Jayatrada and the head should go and fall on the father's lap. So, exactly, Arjuna released his weapon, his arrow, cut the head and immediately sent numerous arrows. That arrows carried the head of Jayatrada and put on the lap of father. He was closing his eyes and praying. Suddenly, something fell. He got up. So, the head fall from the head of Jayatrada fell on the ground. Immediately, as soon as fell on the ground, his head burst into 100 pieces. So, Krishna always hankering to save his devotees. He personally controls the loss of nature to protect his devotees. It is called Bhaktavatsala. He does not care for any other thing. The conclusion here is, under the will of Lord, everything happens. The so-called leaders neither they can create nor destroy it. If at all it has to be destroyed, it should be sanctioned by the will of the Lord. Lord gives protection according to one's surrender. Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, As we surrender to Lord, Lord will also reciprocate. Similarly, if we sincerely follow the instruction of our Guru, chanting six notes, getting up early in the morning, attending reading, hearing, spreading the Holy Name, if we sincerely follow the instruction of Lord, sorry, spiritual master Prabhupada, Krishna is certainly bound to give protection from all sides. And later, Krishna will take us back home, back to Godhead. That is the will. He is always ready to give protection to his devotees. That is the purport of this verse. Thus ends this Bhagavad Gita.

**Key Quote:** "So the nature of Kali Yuga is, the Kali Yuga is even famous as the age of quarrel."
**Summary:** The speaker transitions to discussing current events, specifically a cricket tournament controversy, to illustrate the quarrelsome nature of Kali Yuga and how it manifests at various levels of society.

So the last week, one of the important news has been that the next year in 2025, early 2025, there is going to be a world's cricket tournament, Champions Trophy, ICC Champions Trophy, which is supposed to be hosted by Pakistan and to be played in Pakistan. So India has raised objections that they don't want to send their team to Pakistan due to security reasons and also due to the tensions, political tension, which is existing between, prevailing between the two countries. And Pakistan is adamant, they want the tournament to happen there only and they are demanding. They are demanding ICC, that it should go on whether they come or don't come, whether India participates or not participates. But if India does not participate, then there will be a huge revenue loss because everyone, India is the most populated country in the world and has the most crazy cricket fans, everyone wants to watch Indian team. If India doesn't play, the viewership goes down. So ICC is in trouble. So why I am sharing this is because we can see there is this fight happening at an international level between nations. So the nature of Kali Yuga is, the Kali Yuga is even famous as the age of quarrel. So there exists fight at so many levels on Kali Yuga, between persons to persons, society. Society to society, community to community, and even nation, state to state. We also know how here, Kannada, we have to, Kannadigas want people to talk Kannada. Others don't want, they don't want to learn Kannada, so there is tension. And nation to nation, as we have seen here. And therefore, it is so difficult, for people to live together, even within a family, you know, or for friends, and for communities, to live together,

accepting each other's differences and to stay without fighting is such a difficult thing. Yet, Srimad Bhagavatam, by its existence, exemplary devotees, narrations of the exemplary devotees, has given us practical demonstration of how we can live peacefully in this world, even in the current age of Kali, if we practice the principles mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam. And based on these principles of Srimad Bhagavatam, Srimad Bhagavatam, based on these principles of Srimad Bhagavatam, only Srila Prabhupada started the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. It is an international society, coming together of the devotee people from all parts of the world, all race, caste, creed, religion, colour, coming together for the purpose of Krishna Consciousness and staying together. So, it is also said, It's also said ISKCON is also famously it is coined that Srila Prabhupada built ISKCON

**Key Quote:** "The international society for Krishna consciousness has been organized for this purpose."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the purpose of ISKCON, citing a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing the importance of devotee association for understanding the Lord and His devotees.

when Srila Prabhupada built a house in which the whole world can live. So Prabhupada in fact defines the purpose of starting ISKCON. Why did he start ISKCON? It is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam 4th Canto 12th Chapter 48. In the context of Drona Maharaj and Drona Maharaj's character and activities. In the end of that narration where Maitreya Rishi is narrating this. He says, Prabhupada says in the purport. It is said that only in the association of devotees can one understand the importance of the character. And pastimes of the supreme personality of Godhead or his devotees. It is especially recommended that Drona Maharaj's character be discussed in a society of the twice born. Which refers to the qualified Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. One should especially seek the society of Brahmanas who are elevated to the position of Vaishnavas. Thus discussion. The discussion of Srimad Bhagavatam which describes the character and pastimes of devotees and the Lord is very quickly effective. Then Prabhupada states the purpose. The international society for Krishna consciousness has been organized for this purpose. What is that purpose? In every center of this society, not only in the morning, evening or noon. But practically 24 hours a day. There is continuous devotional service going on. Anyone who comes into contact with the society automatically becomes a devotee.

**Key Quote:** "Anyone can join the international society for Krishna consciousness and be initiated to become twice born."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the opportunity for anyone to join ISKCON, become initiated, and be considered twice-born, emphasizing that advancement in devotional service is only possible in the association of devotees.

We have actual experience that many Karmis and others come to the society. And find a very pleasing and peaceful atmosphere in the temples of ISKCON. In this verse. The word Dvijanmanam means one of the twice born. Anyone can join the international society for Krishna consciousness. And be initiated to become twice born. So Prabhupada opened up this opportunity for all of us. For anyone who agrees to practice the principles of Krishna consciousness. And be in the association of devotees. To become initiated and to become twice born. And that is the purpose of ISKCON. So therefore we see in the association of devotees. One can stay together despite the nature of Kali Yuga which is full of quarrel and fight. So it is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees. Therefore there is one more statement of Srila Prabhupada where Prabhupada says. That if one thinks that one can advance in devotional service or Krishna consciousness. By practicing alone. One is living in hallucination. To think that I can advance by myself living alone. I don't need any association of devotees. That means hallucination. It's only imagination.

#### devotee association, imperfection, ISKCON as a hospital

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "ISKCON is a hospital."
**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges that friction and disagreements are natural when living with others, even in ISKCON, and uses the analogy of ISKCON being a hospital for those who recognize their spiritual disease.

It is possible only in living in association of devotees. But then when we live with some devotees. When we live or when we stay with different people. It is natural that there will be some kind of friction. Some kind of disagreement. Some kind of you know fault from one person to other person. And there can be kind of disturbance between each other. So it is common. Even in the society of so called devotees. Even within ISKCON. It happened. Once one devotee came to Srila Prabhupada. And told Prabhupada that I want to leave this movement. I want to leave the association of devotees. So Prabhupada was very surprised. He was very distressed. He asked why? What happened? Why do you want to leave? So he said. This devotee. He said this to me. That devotee he is so harsh. So cruel. This devotee she is so mean. How can devotees behave like this? That's why I don't want to stay with them. Then Srila Prabhupada said. Who is devotee in ISKCON now? Only one devotee is there me. All of you have just shaven up. Wearing robes. Wearing tilak, kanti mala. And acting like devotees. So actually you are trying to be devotees. So you are not actually devotees. You are trying to be devotees. And therefore when we are practicing devotees. When we are sadhakas. It is natural that we are not perfect. We are all patients. ISKCON is a hospital.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Those who don't come to ISKCON, they don't know that they are deceased."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the hospital analogy, explaining that those who come to ISKCON are aware of their spiritual disease and are seeking treatment, and that devotional service makes the material world appear full of pleasure.

The difference between those who come to ISKCON and those who don't come to ISKCON is They don't know that they are deceased. Those who don't come. Those who are coming regularly. And practicing everything. They know we have got the disease. So we are taking treatment from the doctor. And then Those who are little seriously infected. They will get admitted also. Like we are all admitted. Full time. Even more means intensive care. ICU. So actually we are all practitioners. People make mistake generally. When they see devotees, kanti mala, tilak. This thing they think that Oh he is sadhu. He is perfect. Sadhu bhushana. Sadhu means reservoir of all good qualities. It is true. It should be like that. But We are not pure. We are practicing. We are becoming pure. So therefore Prabhupada writes further in one more Srimad Bhagavatam purport about this. In the same context of Dhruva Maharaj's Leela Prabhupada says. Anyamadi philosopher may question us. You may be very happy in the association of devotees but what is your plan for crossing the ocean of material existence? Dhruva Maharaj's answer is that it is not very difficult. He clearly says that this ocean can be crossed very easily if one simply becomes mad to hear the glories of the lord. For anyone who consistently engages in hearing the topics of the lord from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam and Chaitanya Charita Amrita and who is actually addicted to this process just as one becomes addicted to intoxicants it is very easy to cross the nescience of material existence. The ocean of material nescience is compared to a blazing fire. Samsara Dhabanala. But to a devotee this blazing fire is insignificant because he is completely absorbed in devotional service. Although the material world is blazing fire, to a devotee it appears full of pleasure. Vishwampurna Sukhayate.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "By devotional service one is elevated to transcendental planet Goloka and Dhavan and also there, there is only devotional service."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotional service is the same in both the material and spiritual worlds, using the analogy of an unripe and ripe mango to illustrate the difference in relishability.

So the purport of this statement by Dhruva Maharaj is that devotional service in the association of devotees is the cause of the development of further devotional service. By devotional service one is elevated to transcendental planet Goloka and Dhavan and also there, there is only devotional service. So for the devotee both in the material and spiritual world is the same. There also devotional service, here also devotional service. Devotional service does not change but the devotee changes, the devotee improves. Prabhupada gives wonderful example here in the purport. The example of mango can be given here. If one gets an unripe mango, it is still a mango. And when it is ripe it remains the same mango. But it has become more tasteful and relishable. When the mango becomes ripe it will be sweet, delicious, tasteful, relishable. Similarly, there is devotional service performed according to the directions of the spiritual master and injunctions and regulative principles of Shastra. That is Vaidhi Bhakti or Sadhana Bhakti. And there is devotional service in the spiritual world rendered directly in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But they are both the same. There is no change. The difference is that one stage is unripe the other stage is ripe and more relishable.

**Key Quote:** "Therefore, it is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of devotee association for maturing in devotional service, comparing devotees to unripe mangoes that may taste sour but can grow together in ISKCON.

Therefore, it is possible to mature in devotional service only in the association of devotees. It is said that only in the association of devotees one can understand the importance of the character and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or his devotees. So, therefore we are all unripe mangoes. So, we are all devotees but not pure devotees. We are in the process of becoming pure devotees. As long as we are following the instructions of the spiritual master, following the rules and regulations and trying to advance then we are in the path to become ripened. So, this is important. So, while we are in the path of becoming pure devotees there will be in the unripe stage there will be if you pluck an unripe stage if you taste an unripe mango what will happen? It will appear sour. Therefore, our relationships among devotees sometimes may appear sour. You are trying to bite an unripe mango. So, it will be sour. So, therefore we have to be careful and that is also one of the reason why Srila Prabhupada created ISKCON so that even unripe stage even the devotees in unripe stage, mangoes in unripe stage also can differentiate together

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of diamonds being polished through friction to illustrate how devotees, through association and interaction, can become more refined and pure.

so that together they can grow. One more example one devotee gave me one senior devotee was giving that the association of devotees living in association of devotees or being together in association of devotees practicing devotees, sadhakas not even pure devotees under the instruction of pure devotees staying with sadhakas it is like this. You know how diamonds diamonds get that shine and glow and you know so sparkling and diamonds are liked by everyone right? Especially for jewellery and this thing so much they make. So, how does it come? It is nothing but carbon charcoal, coal is also carbon diamond also is carbon coal is black, ugly not so good. Diamond is shiny, sparkling how it is possible when it is extracted from the underground it is not really that sparkling shining diamond it becomes how it becomes like that they crush, they cut and after that they put in one machine all the diamonds cut diamonds together they will put in a machine and in very high speed this machine is rotated and what happens? One diamond to another diamond it rubs friction and by that friction all the edges, rough edges everything get cut together and then it becomes smooth and shiny and then after some time of rubbing it will become when it is taken out each diamond would have become shiny similarly all devotees dark ugly put together nice rubbing and after that shiny diamond like pure devotees will come that is the formula of getting together devotees in ISKCON

**Summary:** The speaker introduces a quote from a Bhagavad Gita lecture by Srila Prabhupada, using the analogy of a ship journey to emphasize the importance of tolerance and focusing on the philosophy rather than the personalities of fellow devotees.

so therefore when we are in association of devotees, devotees should be we should all learn to become little tolerant to each other so one more Draupad gives very wonderful explanation about this in a Bhagavad Gita lecture given in early days of ISKCON January 3rd 1967 in New York Bhagavad Gita 10th chapter 4th shloka Prabhupada gives this lecture in fact when I joined ISKCON full time as a Brahmachari way back in 2009 just before joining at that time we had Satyagorachandra Prabhu who was the temple commander here he was ashram head now he is in the Andhra Pradesh and Hyderabad he is a governing body member and president of Hyderabad so at that time very senior devotee very nice very sweet devotee so he told us told us bhaktas he told us when you go inside ashram when you join you will have so many devotees because I was coming from a very different background I was coming from home I had not lived any hostel any community I was living with my family my father mother and my sister that's all small family never lived in a bigger community now I am going to enter into community society of devotees so how to take it so Prabhu said as soon as you go inside when you enter ashram entrance just before you go to prasadam hall near the staircase there is one big quote Prabhu had nicely made that and got it put there for all devotees to read when passing by even daily this was that quote this is from the Bhagavad Gita 10.4 lecture so big laminated quote was there and he said if you read this understand this and internalize it and start living like that then your life in ashram will be very smooth

so one should be tolerant while one devotees should be tolerant to other devotees it is also very interesting to note this one statement which is very much holds good for everyone i suppose at least it holds good for me we are usually when dealing with anyone we are usually we follow this principle strictly strict with others lenient with self when it comes to others you know some rules regulations this that everything we are expectation we are very strict with others hey why you are not coming for Srimad why that mataji is coming so late you don't know what time class starts not meant for you just example i am drawing very strict with others you have to come on time you have to listen attentively all these things but when it comes to ourselves we are very lenient Mangalarati 4.30 corn shell will blow you have to go no it will go till 4.35 punching 4.35 lenient no last night it was difficult ok 4.40 sometime 4.45 sometime don't punch you know devotees some devotees will say in our community i am saying actually we will have this system to discipline to practice so that we can take advantage of the ship for that there is some system ok come on time take the maximum advantage but sometime devotees can you know lenient to self like i think many times it's ok i can go at 4.40 4.45 sometime i can miss punching i can put forgot to punch later all kinds of so this also can happen strict with others lenient to self therefore devotees are very tolerant we expect all devotees should be very tolerant but we will be very brash you will be like this only one devotee was telling Prabhu you don't know i am from kshatriya family Prabhu i am like this only i am very passionate one devotee told me senior devotee told why are you walking like this Prabhu i am from kshatriya family i am like this only i walk like this that aggression is required you know it is in my blood i cannot take out you know my blood then you are thinking you are not come to Krishna consciousness to display your conditioning to purify your conditioning you have come you have come to forget all your blood rajput kshatriya this that everything and become devotee become Vaishnava artificially you need not become like this but at the same time you need not earlier you were like this at least be normal now correct and you know telling everyone hey no you know what who i am you should listen to me that is strict with others lenient with self so devotees let them be if they are tolerant not tolerant just because devotees are tolerant doesn't mean we have to become we can be just like that oh they will tolerate devotees will tolerate no we have to be very

so this is one devotee taught wonderful this thing so if we do this then it means a complete apology this is how we should apologize complete apology so here we see Parikshit Maharaj also is doing this he is repenting and then the next verses you will see how he is praying to the Lord for his mistake and that it should be and how he is planning what he is planning also is there we will see ideally when he comes to know the curse happens what a wonderful exemplary plan he made so that that mistake does not repeat such plan gave rise to just him not doing the mistake it is teaching all of us we got Srimad Bhagavatam as a result of his plan see how RPP Parikshit Maharaj has implemented so sometimes when we make mistake you know there are two extreme one I said is strict with others lenient to self another end is you know oh now we have to become humbler than blade of glass so it is does not mean that we become have very low self esteem that you know I am useless I am worth I am worthless I am useless I am not one person one someone boy came he was chanting four rounds from past so many months he is coming then one year over two years three years still he is not able to give up some coffee tea and he is not able to he is not increasing chanting he is coming regularly once in a while he will come and go so devotee is asking that boy that devotee hey increase your rounds try to give up what to do Prabha I am fallen so I am so fallen Prabha I cannot do that is not fallen that is why you have to do then only you will rise right so that is called guilt so there is difference between repentance versus

**Key Quote:** "Our scriptures are saying that we cannot perceive the reality with our senses because our senses, we all have four inherent defects."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the limitations of our senses in perceiving reality, referencing scientific theories about extra dimensions and emphasizing the need for spiritual knowledge, humility, and surrender to a spiritual master to gain a glimpse of reality.

I'll share with you a quote from a very eminent scientist. He says, "All the scientific theories do not dictate that there has to be only three dimensions. Although we can't see with our eyes or feel with our fingers, additional dimensions of space are a logical possibility. Our senses register only three dimensions. So, extra dimensions might sound incredible. Even the dimension in the world we are living in, the Earth planet we are living in, in Hyderabad city what we are living in, what we are seeing is not necessarily complete reality. Forget about where we have not gone. But our scriptures are saying that we cannot perceive the reality with our senses because our senses, we all have four inherent defects. So, with this limitation, inherent defects in our senses, we will never be able to perceive the reality. So, when we get spiritual knowledge, we understand how small, insignificant we are, coupled with humility. I am a small, insignificant Jeeva. I have limited sense perception. Can't even control myself. How can I control things?" When that living entity develops that humility, surrenders to the Supreme Lord, surrenders to a bona fide spiritual master, OM AGYANATI MIRAN DASYA GYANANJANA SHALAKE, we open our eyes with the torch of knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "At the age of 12, somehow or another, I rebelled against the system which I was brought up into."
**Summary:** The speaker describes his early life, including his rebellion against the system he was raised in, his becoming a vegetarian, and his search for the absolute truth, mentioning the three types of people who come to Krishna according to the Bhagavad Gita.

I guess it began when I was 12 years old. Now I'm 70, and without knowing in this life, without the knowledge of what is Krishna consciousness, what was Srila Prabhupada, at the age of 12, somehow or another, I rebelled against the system which I was brought up into. I became a vegetarian. I started searching for the absolute truth. The Bhagavad Gita tells us that three types of persons come to Krishna: those who are seeking money, those who are in distress, and those who are seeking the absolute truth. So I don't think I fell into the category of those who were seeking money, because I had a lot of that, and I gave it all up. It was self-made, but some help from the parents and the family. And distress, yes, we were all in distress in this material world. We didn't know which way to go, what to do, our seemingly happiness with our material life, but actually seeking the absolute truth. I was looking in the mountains, I was looking in the forests, I was looking in the swamps, I was living in the ghettos with the black people, I was prompting with kings, I was living rich, I was living poor, I was traveling from place to place, with vows of poverty, trying to understand.

And I met what I could call my Bhartma Pradaksha guru. He was the one, Baba Ramdas. He wrote a famous book called, Be Here Now. He had journeyed to India. Anyways, he introduced me to the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, indirectly. And I did that, and we traveled as we did, many people did in that time, among the hippie communes and things. And probably first heard of Prabhupada way back in 1968, when he was in San Francisco. And like this, life went on and on. And the travels led me to a bus that was in a house that I was staying with. We were all, a lot of people staying in a house in the house. The bus had Vishnu John Swami in it. And he's camped out in our house in Fort Lauderdale. And we did some park, we did some kirtan with him. And he was only there a night, so there wasn't much, but what is this, right? And they gave me a book, a Back to Godhead magazine, which I threw on the bed and it went underneath the water bed, later it came out, and I dried it and I read it. And it was a great book. And, of course, chanting Hare Krishna. Then again I met him by the will of providence, meeting devotees in different places, not really understanding, in rock festivals and in downtowns and book distribution, but already chanting Hare Krishna, but not really knowing anything about the Krishna consciousness movement.

**Key Quote:** "So they said, when you come to Krishna, you should bring an offering."
**Summary:** The speaker describes meeting Vishnu John Swami again, making an offering of fruits and flowers, and his subsequent journey to Miami, where he underwent a physical transformation and encountered devotees.

Then again it really began. I met Vishnu John Swami in 2012. I met him on Krishna Goswami in a bus, in a park in Phoenix, Arizona. So they said, when you come to Krishna, you should bring an offering. So that day we went out with a station wagon, big cars with the back of it. We went all over the fruit orchards and the flowers and the dates, and we picked them from everywhere around Phoenix, which is a famous growing area, and we filled up the whole car. And we brought it to the park. The park where Vishnu John Swami was. And we offered it to the deities of Radha Damodar there. So then Mr. John said, you've made this offering, you have to come now, back to the temple with us. So we went back to the temple and I stayed a couple of days with them. They were leaving for India, early days. This was probably the beginning of 73 by that time. Yeah. And, uh, so that began the journey very shortly, Krishna took me, he took me out of the house of the rising sun, which is a famous place in New Orleans, we won't get in any details. And he transferred me to Miami by airplane with a few bodyguards. And I got to Miami and I had an intimate relationship with it. My first devotee there, his name was Maha Sringa, he was Bhakta Mike then. He looked at me. By this time I had transformed from a long haired hippie with hair down to here. And I had on a dhoti, which was made out of a sheet. I had some beads which were tied up into knots by a rope. I had a sika that was funny shaped, it came down to my back, later became matted. Yeah. And, uh, I had some toothpaste which I had used to make tea lock. And I came from a jailhouse where I was only for 24 hours and the devotees were coming in, they had been picked up for distributing books. And they were coming out, they were getting immediately bonded. And they looked at me, I looked kind of funny, you know, I didn't really look like your regular Hare Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts his initial interactions with devotees in Miami, his acceptance into the Brahmachari ashram, and his decision to stay and try Krishna consciousness, emphasizing his ongoing effort to become a true devotee.

And they said, what temple are you from? I said, I'm from the temple of the world. And they said, where are you going? And my brother was there with some of my friends and they said, he's coming with us. We have a party for him, he's been gone for some time. And I said, no, I'm going with them. And they said, yes, we'll be out in 10 minutes, you come with us. So then Maha Sringa's Bhakta Mike is there. He looks me over. Hmm. What kind of animal is this, you know? And he gives me a dhoti, he gives me a kurta, he gives me some toothbrush, toothpaste. That's all I was. That was it. There was nothing else. And he gave me a mat, it was in the Brahmachari ashram. And he goes, that way's east. It was 10 o'clock at night. Everybody was sleeping. I had no idea which way was east. That's what it meant. That's where you put your head when you sleep. So that began. And then I said, okay, I'll stay here 30 days and give it a try. Never left. That was in 73. So still to this day, trying to be a devotee, I haven't yet become a devotee, but I'm trying. Right? So they asked, when did you become a devotee? I haven't become one yet.

**Key Quote:** "So for the first month I was chanting 32 rounds, right?"
**Summary:** The speaker shares humorous anecdotes about his early days in Krishna consciousness, including his misunderstanding of chanting rounds and his initial success in book distribution, highlighting his natural propensity for this service.

So during the years, many things, like was funny thing in the very beginning, I was, I thought that one round was once and back again. I thought that was one round. So for the first month I was chanting 32 rounds, right? And I thought this is hard and everybody was finishing before me. Then one day I'm watching this Brahman, he's chanting and he gets to one round and he pulls down the bead. I watched him again. He did it again. He had his beads out too. I said to him, Prabhu, you're cheating. He said, what do you mean? I says, you're counting half a round as one round. So then he explained to me and then chanting 16 rounds became a little easier. And then after a couple of weeks they said, you should go out and try book distribution. And, uh, I said, okay. And, uh, some of our, some of the first devotees that are still with me in Krishna consciousness to this day, like Abhirama, Adridharana, Mahashringa, they were all there. We were a big band in Miami. So they said, you got to go out and try book distribution and you got to put on this wig, put on a hat, a wig, put on these Garmi clothes, this thing, and you got to go out and distribute books. I said, I'll go out, but I'm not going to do all this stuff. I said, I've changed my life now. So I went out with my Sankirtan leader and four or five other devotees and they were all out there and our friend Adridharana was there, but he was dressed up a little bit and he would point to people and he would say, we're distributing for India and collecting money for people in India. And here's one of the people from there that was so grateful to us. He came back to help us out because I was wearing a dhoti. So the very first day I went out, I collected more than my Sankirtan leader. I distributed more books and collected more money. So they told me, Prabhu, this is your propensity. This is what you have to do.

**Key Quote:** "One was to offer obeisances."
**Summary:** The speaker details the first of three personal instructions he received from Srila Prabhupada, which was to offer obeisances, and his determination to receive initiation directly from Prabhupada.

But I also had an inclination toward farms and gardens and cows. So I said, this isn't all I can do, right? And Srila Prabhupada had given me three personal instructions that I consider personal instructions. One was to offer obeisances. That was the first one. That happened in Philadelphia in the airport in 1976. I went there to New Vrindavan for initiation three years after I joined, two and a half years after I joined, because I didn't want a rittvik initiation. I didn't want it. I wanted Prabhupada to hand me my beads. Prabhupada was doing rittvik from the early 70s, right? And I kept asking my temple. The temple president thinks I want to go where Prabhupada is and I want to take initiation. We'll do by letter. We'll do this, that. You have to stay here and distribute books. That's what pleases Prabhupada. And we were developing gardens for some of the temples and I was sending Prabhupada coconuts and nim twigs and everything every day when he was touring around America. We'd climb up the trees and get them in Miami. So Prabhupada was coming. I went to New Vrindavan. I had a Sankirtan party. We had our own party. I was the leader. And I went to New Vrindavan and I told the Sankirtan party, you know, you guys go back where you came from. I'm staying here until Prabhupada comes. You can't. You're leaving the temple. I said, I'm leaving. I'm waiting here for Prabhupada. I'm not going to go for this anymore, you know? So they went back and I waited and Prabhupada came and he gave me initiation personally. That went really well. So when I first saw Srila Prabhupada, the very first time was when he came into the airport. In Pittsburgh. You got to imagine the airport's a big circle like this. And on the top, the stairs come out and people come out from the different planes from the different side, right? So for months before Prabhupada's coming, Prabhupada's coming, Prabhupada's coming, he even asked, why is it every new temple, every temple I go to smells like fresh paint? Everything would always be ready. And that was the mantra, Prabhupada's coming, Prabhupada's coming. And we were just totally absorbed in it. Everything we did was. We're going to meet Prabhupada, Prabhupada's coming here. So there was a tumultuous kirtan in the airport. We could do kirtans at that time in the airport. And the Radha Damodar parties were there, the traveling parties, a lot of people because it was new Vrindavan. It was a big gathering. And of course there were some other passengers and airport officials around. So finally Prabhupada walks out. We're right down there in the middle of the kirtan, right in the center. Prabhupada walks out. And. Yeah. When he walked out, the whole kirtan stopped. Everybody hit the ground and did obeisances. But I didn't. I'm looking, Prabhupada, oh my God, he's come. And he goes like this. Looked straight at me and I was the only one, like this.

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the second personal instruction he received from Srila Prabhupada during a morning walk, which was to protect the cows, emphasizing the directness of the instruction.

So that was his first instruction was to offer obeisances. And the second instruction I got with him was on a morning walk. I was tending the cows. I was tending the cows in New Vrindavan and helping to build A-frames and do different things. And we were living up in the old Vrindavan farm. And Prabhupada came up. I went on many morning walks in Darshan. But in this morning walk, I'm standing, there's a lot of pictures, I'm right next to Prabhupada. And I'm herding the cows, so I got some boots on and got a t-shirt on instead of a dhoti and everything. I got a dhoti, but that, so I'm herding the cows. And this one cow kept hitting Prabhupada like this. She was a Friesian, she was a Friesian cow, black and white. She kept nudging Prabhupada. And Prabhupada was affectionate, pat her on the head and he would smile. And then Prabhupada turns to, and he says, how old is this cow? Hari Sori says, she's 10 or 12 years old, Prabhupada. I said no. I said, Prabhupada, I'm her cow herd. She's only four years old and her name is Kalindi. And she's just started giving milk. And Prabhupada looked at me directly in the eyes and he says, you must protect, he didn't say we should protect, he said, you must protect the cows.

**Key Quote:** "Dance."
**Summary:** The speaker shares the third personal instruction he received from Srila Prabhupada, which was to dance, despite being initially prevented from doing so, highlighting Prabhupada's recognition of his devotional expression.

Second instruction. Third instruction, I like to dance. And I thought maybe Prabhupada would give me a name, something to do with dancing. And the day before initiation, we were in a Ratha Yatra in Cleveland, but Prabhupada couldn't go there. So it came in the front page of the paper, the Rathkart with Lord Jagannath there and everything. And somehow in the paper, in the front of the paper, I was dancing in front of the Rathkart, both feet off the ground, my hands up in the air and my Chatur flying. That came on the front of the Cleveland Press. And I was told later by Kulik Shekhar, Prabhupada's disciple, he said, oh, that devotee dances like Lord Chaitanya. Right? So I thought that Prabhupada maybe would give me some Nataraja, I didn't know, right? So we were outside the barn going into Radha Vrindavan Chandra's temple and we were dancing like everything. And a couple of times, Prabhupada looked at me and smiled, right? It was in Brahmachari cloth, there's pictures of that too. And you come into Radha Vrindavan Chandra's temple and there's a hallway and two devotees can be on each side. And then in the middle, Prabhupada would walk. So I was jumping up and down, I was right there as Prabhupada would come in just a few feet and I was dancing like anything and Prabhupada was ready to come in. And this devotee Charu, he pushes me down, he says, no, you may hit Prabhupada, you can't dance here. I said, I have to dance. And he said, no, you can't dance. And he pushed me the second row behind. And I said, Charu was his name. He later had some different qualities. So Prabhupada walked in and all the devotees were like this. They were a small kirtan. Nobody was really dancing when he walked in the hallway, right? Prabhupada walked over, right next to me, he stopped, he turned, he looked me in the eyes and he raised both hands, one had a bead bag and one had a cane. He said, dance. And he wasn't there when the devotee pushed me behind, but he was there outside. And he had seen that picture of Cleveland Ratha Yatra. So that was the third instruction I got from Srila Prabhupada.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna consciousness is like this rose."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts an analogy Prabhupada gave using a rose to illustrate the difference between offering something to Krishna and offering it for personal sense gratification, and his confusion about its application.

Those were direct instructions. And then one instruction I thought I got from Prabhupada was we were in a garden with Prabhupada. He was giving a darshan, and he had a rose in his hand. He had just finished telling us that sense gratification is like salt. You have to have a little bit or you'll die. And he described the six Goswamis, how they had to take a pat of butter, a little bit of salt, or otherwise they would die too. And how they had to sleep one hour or two hours. They had to eat with a pat of butter. And he said, and for defense, they were always dependent on Krishna. And for mating, he said, there was no question. Then he had this rose. And there was one rose with smell, too. So Prabhupada had this rose. And he said, Krishna consciousness is like this rose. He says, if I have this beautiful rose, and I think, let me give it to Radha Vrindavan Chandra, Prabhupada smiled. He says, I'm going to Vaikuntha. Then he put down again. He says, but I have the same rose. And I think, let me give it to my girlfriend, he goes, I'm going to hell and he throws the rose and I was right there and the rose came right in front of me but this other devotee grabbed it right, I didn't get the rose, he took it and I didn't know whether Papa was telling me that if I offer roses to Robert Johnson I'm going to Vaikuntha or I'm going to hell, I didn't know which one and I'm still wondering.

**Summary:** The speaker reflects on the trials and tribulations in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing Prabhupada's instruction to dedicate one's life to Krishna and highlighting the personal relationship devotees can have with Prabhupada through his teachings.

So that was another indirect instruction. So over the years, of course, we all go through many trials and tribulations in Krishna consciousness. It's not easy when we declare war on maya, it's not ready. And I remember many times in Prabhupada's personal presence and sometimes in lectures, there was a famous line which we always remember which has impelled us in Krishna consciousness all these years. Prabhupada would always say, give this one life to Krishna, give this one life to Krishna. So that's what he would implore to all his devotees and all his, they give this one life to Krishna. So we will try that whether we, I'm still trying, 30 days I thought I would give it, I'm still trying to this day. So there's so much more and like I said, we're still trying to become devotees, but Prabhupada's instructions to us are there every day. Every one of us, every instruction we read from his books, we hear from a tape, when we understand this is our guru dot the dash, this is where Prabhupada wants me to serve.

All those are personal instructions, there's no difference. So many devotees had a lot of, this is all the association I ever had with Prabhupada, never had more and you, so many things have come from the books. Whenever we have a question, whenever we have a problem, all we have to do is read Prabhupada's books with the Shri Madbhagavatam and we have to ask our question with all sincerity then open the book to any place, any Bhagavatam, any canto and read, the answer will come. Prabhupada was giving a class once and in this class it was all about the Shri Madbhagavatam and how it's, you know, the prime benediction for humanity at large, how its...

**Summary:** The speaker shares an anecdote about Tamal Krishna Maharaj and Prabhupada's instruction to dance even in the face of challenges, emphasizing the importance of devotion and Lord Chaitanya's mercy.

one time whereas Tamal Krishna, he wasn't dancing in the kirtan. This was in Bombay when Mr. Nair was going to take away the, take, take away the temple from us and, uh, Prop, I went over to Tamal Krishna Maharaj and he told him, he said, even if Mr. Nair won't give us this temple, to give us this land, there was no temple yet, dancing kirtan and Tamal told him, when the weights come on my head, my feet get heavy on the ground. Prophet said, no dancing, he told him. So this is the devotees, of course everything's not going to be perfect. We hear chan Hari Krishnan be happy. This is nothing but kevala nanda khanda. It's all true. But then again we have to rid ourselves of our material desires in this life and go closer and closer to Krishna. So there are so many things we could say, but we have a big yatra today and I just, I have to thank each and every single devotee that's here and so impressed and I have been for years so impressed with the caliber of your love and your dedication to Shila Prabhupada. This is, this is what Prabhupad wanted. That's why he brought his dancing white elephants to India so that this would happen. He says, westerners, they all fall for sex, Indians, they fall for money, but you guys are falling for neither. This is very monumental. Our children's children's children, prophet said about the gurukula and it's the same thing. You're now into the third generation of Prabhupada disciples. So this is is what's going to save the world. This is the army you are making now that will march all over this whole planet after this planet and the modern civilization as we know it today, you will endure and this will spread to every town in every village. Already we're in every town in every village and Lord Chaitanya's mercy is going, but his soldiers have a big job ahead of them.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is saying yes, you exist after life, after old age, after death."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's teachings on the soul, matter, and reincarnation, contrasting it with the limitations of scientific understanding.

And Krishna says in the next sloka that there is a superior substance and matter, a superior entity. And what is it? It is the spirit soul. So the superior energy is one which is exploiting this matter. And it is, the name given by the Lord is Jitabhutam. And if the soul is energy, then the law of conservation of energy should hold good for the soul too. So that explains that yes, we do exist after life. And Krishna makes it more clear in the second chapter. In fact, the Bhagavad Gita starts from here. Second chapter, thirteenth sloka. Dehino asliyatha dehe ghaumaryam yoganam jara. Krishna is saying yes, there is a matter. Deha is the matter. And there is a Dehi, which is energy, superior energy. And this energy goes under transformations in different phases. Ghaumaryam, yoganam, jara. What happens next? What happens after jara, after old age? Ghaumaryam said the end. He didn't say the end. He says Dehantara. There is a transformation. Next transformation is a new body. Tatha Dehantara praptir. Krishna is saying yes, you exist after life, after old age, after death. You exist. And you go, you pass into another body. Scientists got stuck here. They understood till here whatever Krishna was saying. Yeah, there is a matter, there is energy. This whole world is a combination of matter and energy. This part they cannot see. Tatha Dehantara praptir. They have no idea how it happens. Only Dheeras they understand and they don't get stuck. Dheeras tattva namuhyati.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses why scientists, despite their knowledge, cannot perceive the soul, illustrating this with the example of heart surgeons and referencing a heart surgeon's letter seeking understanding of the soul.

Not everybody will understand or everybody will appreciate. So why scientists got stuck here? Why they are not able to understand this also? There are so many learned people in the world. So many engineers. So many doctors. So many PhDs. They don't understand. And that also Krishna explains. Why they don't understand. Krishna says in the 15th chapter. Very clearly he says why they cannot see. budhkramantam sthambapi bhunjanam vagunanam guranvitam vimudana anupasyanti pasyanti jnani chakshusah. That's why Prabhupada says raska. Krishna used the word. What to do? Prabhupada speaks as it is. What other Krishna says, as it is. That's why Prabhupada says raska. Krishna is using the word. Vimudana. Muda means foolish people. Vimudana means too much. That's why they cannot understand. Utkramantam means how the soul leaves the body. Utkramantam means coming out. Emanating out. They cannot see. Sthitam. How the soul is currently staying in the body. That also they cannot see. There are doctors called cardiologists. Heart surgeons. They open the heart. They see everything. They can't see that the soul is sitting there. Sthitam. They cannot understand. Similarly when they are doing the surgery and suppose something goes wrong and the patient dies. They don't understand what goes wrong. Utkramantam. They can't see the soul leaving the body. The heart or body, whatever. They can't understand. Why? Prabhupada says raska. Because Krishna says. Vimudana anupasyanti. Vimudanas cannot see this. Foolish people cannot see this. How the soul is staying in the heart in this matter. But how it is experiencing the interactions of three modes. They cannot see. Finally when it leaves the body that also they cannot see. There is a book called Coming Back. In that book there is a letter by a heart surgeon. He wrote an open letter in the newspaper that I want to understand what is going on. And somehow one of the disciples of Prabhupada brought that newspaper to Prabhupada. That there is a heart surgeon and he wants to know. Because he had done so many heart surgeries. He imagined in that letter that I have experienced the life passing between my fingers. But he has no idea.

**Key Quote:** "Something which you cannot perceive by your senses can be perceived by the scriptures."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of scriptures as a source of knowledge beyond the limitations of the senses and scientific observation.

Then Prabhupada wrote a letter back to him explaining what soul is, what are the attributes and how to perceive it. How to perceive it? Pasyanti Gyan Chakshasa. Pasyanti Gyan Chakshasa. By the eyes of Mahesh. Time of the word is Shastra Chakshasa. By the help of scriptures. That's where everything gets stuck. Because the whole process of scientific discoveries or understanding is based on observation. When I was in school, I remember in my science class, science when we go to the lab, we have a lab manual we used to write there. The first thing we write is observations. It starts with observation. Then comes the theory, then comes the experiment, then conclusion. And all our observations are limited by our senses. They are called Gyanendriyas. Knowledge acquiring senses. So whatever we know about our surroundings is because of these Gyanendriyas. They capture the information around the surrounding and that's how we get them out. And they are limited, so our observations are limited. They are faulty, so our observations are faulty. We cannot see everything with the eyes. And with the same eyes, we design telescopes. With the same eyes, we design microscopes. With the help of this eye which has so many limitations and so many faults. So how the product of this eye which is faulty and which is limited can be perfect and without limit. That's where scientists get stuck. And that's where the significance of the scriptures come into place. Something which you cannot perceive by your senses can be perceived by the scriptures. By this transcendental knowledge. By this transcendental knowledge. Because this knowledge is absolute. This knowledge is perfect. This knowledge is beyond limits. Whereas what scientists can tell us is limited because the senses are limited. Their observations are limited.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the changing nature of scientific knowledge with the absolute truth found in scriptures, leading to a discussion about the nature of the afterlife.

And imperfect. That's why the new scientist comes and he says, no, whatever the previous scientist said is wrong. And this keeps happening after every 50-100 years. My grandfather, if he could have gone to university, and may he never bend. If he could have gone to university, he might be learning, my great grandfather might be learning whatever Dalton told. But the atom is indivisible. The most fundamental particle. But I didn't learn the same thing. I learned something else. No, there are subatomic particles. Electron, proton, neutron. Now next generation are learning something else. They are learning, there are sub-subatomic particles. They are learning about quarks. Future generations will be learning about interesting theories. And I don't know what else theory will come. What else they will be learning. And they will be telling me, after some 3rd generation, if they happen to meet us, they will tell, whatever you learnt is wrong. Pushpa will be just, they will say like this. If I happen to meet my great grandfather, I will say, whatever you learnt from Dalton is wrong. But whatever the fortunate souls have learnt from the scriptures billions of years back is absolute. Today and in the past and even in the future. It's not changing. That's why it's called absolute knowledge. It's not relative. Relative in perspective of time. Or in perspective of different places. It doesn't change. It always remains the truth. Okay, so Krishna explained that yes, we exist. There is afterlife. The ahamdara happens. Only problem is, Muras cannot see it. But Gyan Satsusa can see. Okay, so there may be afterlife. But, what kind of afterlife? We just pass on. We just pass away. Or we come back. Or we pass away where we go. Or we take a U-turn and come back. That is still the question.

**Key Quote:** "What Parikshit Maharaj is trying to do is, how not to come back. And what most of the people in this world is trying to do is, how to come back."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concepts of 'Abhritti' (coming back) and 'Anabhritti' (not coming back) from the Bhagavad Gita, explaining that Parikshit Maharaj seeks liberation while most people desire to return to the material world.

Anyway, Krishna will explain everything. Bhagavad Gita is called complete knowledge. Because it explains. There is no loopholes. So there are two words used in Bhagavad Gita. Aabhrittim and Anabhrittim. Aabhrittim means, after you pass away, you come back. Aabhrittim. Comes. Anabhrittim. Not come back. So there are two possibilities. You may come back, or you may not come back. What Parikshit Maharaj is trying to do is, how not to come back. And what most of the people in this world is trying to do is, how to come back. You know, in villages, sometime back, my grandmother was telling, they used to keep gold in one pot, earthen pot. And they used to tuck the ground, and put that pot there. And, maybe nobody is aware that the home and the person passed away. And their next generation may not be knowing that there is a gold down. They may never have decked up. And this person might have kept with this intention, and next life he may get it back. So everybody is planning on to come back. But we all know, he will not get back. Somebody else will take over. So let's understand, what is Anabhritti and what is Abhritti. In what situation somebody can come back, in what situation somebody doesn't come back. In 8th chapter of Bhagavad Gita, it says that there are two options, coming back or not coming back. Jagdha sasvade mathe Ekaya, Ekaya means the first option. Ekaya yati anabhritti. The first option, the first process is, you will not come back. Anabhritti Anaya, Anaya means the second one, the other one. Avar tehe punha, you will again come back. So there are two processes, two paths. The first one, is make you sure that, make sure that you don't come back. Another one is, make sure that you come back.

**Key Quote:** "You can come back, by being demoted, or you can come back by being promoted."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the two ways of 'Abhritti' - coming back through demotion (due to not following scriptures) or promotion (due to following rituals and good karma), which explains the disparity in the world.

Now this coming back, happens in two ways. One is called demotion, another called promotion. You can come back, by being demoted, or you can come back by being promoted. In the 16th chapter, Krishna talks about, coming back by demotion. So you may come back, but, you will be demoted, in the next life. In which case, it happens, it happens, when you don't follow the laws, of the scriptures. If somebody doesn't follow the laws, of the scriptures, in this life, they will again come back, but with demotion. Adamaam gathiyam Asunim. Asunim means low grade. So those who don't follow the laws, of the scriptures, they will again come back, but, in a low grade. Some lower species of life. A lower consciousness. But there are some people, who follow the laws, who follow whatever scriptures say. They do lot of karma tanda, whatever rituals are mentioned. They also come back. But, with the promotion. This is explained, in the seventh chapter. Divideva hogan means, with lot of luxury. Divine luxuries. They will enjoy it. I hope they got promoted. They will go to higher planets. They will go to higher planets. Surya Naloka means, the planet of Indra. How? By following, the instructions of the scriptures. Because, scriptures also gives the instructions, to the people, who want to come back, and enjoy. There are so many people, who want to come back, so, scriptures give those, do's and don'ts, and that is called, karma tanda. So, they will enjoy. In the higher planet. Higher level of comforts. So, this is, the two examples of, abhirti, coming back. And this explains, why there is so much disparity, in this world. Lot of people tells me this. If there is a God, why there is so much disparity, in the world. Why there are people, who don't have any money, any food. And why there are people, who have so much money, and so much food, that they can't even, enjoy that.

**Key Quote:** "God is the one, who made the system. You want to get demoted, you can get demoted."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the question of disparity in the world, attributing it to the law of karma and the free will of living entities, rather than blaming God.

Too much. Now, you got the idea, why it is like this? Because somebody, who follows the laws, in this life, they will have, they will have lot of resources, lot of luxury, in the next life. Those who don't follow, they may not have. They may be poverty stricken, their consciousness may be low, they may not be so intelligent. So, you got the idea, from where the disparity comes? Because there are two ways, of coming, coming back, in this world. Abhirti. Either by, coming back is Abhirti. Either by demotion, or by, promotions. If you have done good karma, you followed the laws, next life, you will be promoted. With lot of resources, intelligence, looks, knowledge, better consciousness. Because there are two ways, of coming back. But somebody may not get, those resources. So disparity is because, what we have done, in our past life. God should not be, playing for it. But what people do, they say, where is God? There are so many people, dying because of, so many sicknesses, critical illness, where is God? God is the one, who made the system. You want to get demoted, you can get demoted. He made the law of karma. And he gave a free will, to the living entities. Tatha ichchasi tatha kuru. Whatever you want to do, you do. Law of karma will take care of it. So, people come back, with different, kind of backgrounds. And that's why, there is disparity, in this world. So, who should be blamed, for it? The living entity, himself, and not the Lord. Now, the second option, the second path, is called, anabhirti. Means, we will not come back. So, the second option, the second path, is called, anabhirti. In what situation, a person will not come back?

**Key Quote:** "Anybody who transcend, the three modes, of material nature... It will do, anabhirti."
**Summary:** The speaker begins to explain 'Anabhritti' (not coming back), achieved by transcending the three modes of material nature, and introduces the concept of becoming a yogi to attain this.

Any idea? Just. If somebody is doing karma, he will be promoted. The karma will be demoted. If he does a karma, then he will go to the spiritual world. Good. A karma. In simple language, anybody who transcend, the three modes, of material nature. They will still be acting. But their acting, will neither promote, or demote. It will do, anabhirti. 14th chapter, Krishna mentions this. maam cha yohad vichare, na bhakti yogena sevate, sa gunaan samtite tan, brahma puyaya kalpate. They will transcend, they will transcend, the three modes. And they will be situated, in the Brahman. Then what happens? Then they will not be under, the grip of maya. Dehvi hi esa gulmayi, man maya duratvaya, maam eviye pripadyante, mayam etam tadantite. They will be out, of that scope of maya. The erudition of maya. But it looks very difficult, how to do this. If we have to transcend, the three modes, it must be very tough, isn't it? And it must take, lot of time. You have to read, so many Vedas. You have to do, so many yagyas. Lot of tapasya. But Krishna says, no, not really. Krishna says, If somebody becomes a yogi, then he will get the result, of all these things, by default. You have to study, the Vedas. No need to perform, the yagyas. Or execute, tapasya, austerity. Just because, they become a yogi. They get, all these results, plus, they get, paramsthanam, the ultimate destination. Paramsthanam, bekti chadyam. They get, all these results, plus, they get, paramsthanam, the ultimate destination. Paramsthanam, bekti chadyam.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies the definition of a yogi according to Krishna, emphasizing that the best yogi is one who keeps Krishna in their heart and consciousness, achievable through Krishna consciousness.

How to become a yogi? Becoming a yogi, must be very tough. Must take, lot of time. Krishna says, no. Who is yogi? Krishna explains, who is yogi? Because, what, image of the yogi, we have is, different, what Krishna says, as a yogi. When, we think of a yogi, in our mind, what image comes? A person, with a skinny body, not eaten from so many, once, sitting under a tree, closed eyes, maybe half closed eyes. No, that's not what Krishna says, or Krishna mean by yogi. Krishna says, yogi naam api sarve saam, mat gaten antaraatmana. One, who thinks about me, who keeps me, in his consciousness, who keeps me, in his heart, antaraatmana. Sadhavan bhajade yomaam, saame yukta tanho mataa. The best yogi, is one, who keep me, in his heart, who keep me, in his thoughts, in his consciousness, mat gaten antaraatmana. To become that kind of yogi, you need not to do, such a big tapasya, sitting somewhere, in the forest, without food and water, no. Prabhupada says, just follow, my instructions, and you will become, the best yogi. Just be Krishna conscious, that's it, your yogi. Mat gaten antaraatmana means, Krishna in your consciousness. And you are a best yogi. Yukta tanho, the best of the yogi. Among all yogi, all different kinds of yogis, you will be the best yogi. Yogi naam api sarvesa, among all different kinds of yogis, yukta tanho, the best of the yogi. And that is the process, Prabhupada has given us,

**Key Quote:** "Just become, Krishna conscious... very immediately, you will get it."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna consciousness is the easiest path to liberation, especially in Kali Yuga, and offers Krishna's guarantee of immediate results.

Krishna consciousness. Krishna also, clearly mentioned this, in Bhagavad Gita, that you need not to do, that much of tapasya. Denounce everything, go to the forest, don't eat, don't drink, no need to do all that. In fact, for the people of Kali Yuga, that is not possible. I don't know how many people, are going to forest, with tapasya now. How many forests, are going to remain, in the future? Even if somebody, want to do tapasya, they will search out, what is around here. They will search on Google, somewhere. Now, even you can't go to, Himalayas to do meditation. No, you will be sitting there, for meditation, the helicopter will be flying. Very soon, they will put mobile towers, there. So, Krishna says, no need to do all that. He says, in the fifth chapter, sannyasas tu mahava ho, dukham aap tum, ayo, gita ha. Those who don't become, Krishna conscious, ayo, gita ha. They do this, all this dukha. sannyasas tu mahava ho, dukham aap tum, ayo, gita ha. Yogi upto, those who become, Krishna conscious, who become, madh gaten, antar, atmanah. Yogi upto, munir brahma, na chiren, adhika chati. It will not take, much time. You know, the stories, when I was a student, I was a small baby, my mother used to read, some stories. I also, when I grow up, I also used to read, some stories in the book. And, mostly, the stories, start like this, long, long, ago. Once upon a time, isn't it? So, in Sanskrit, that long, long, ago, is called, chir kaaleen. Chir ka, means, long, long, ago. And the word, Krishna used here, that if you become, Krishna conscious, na chiren, opposite of, long, long, ago. Then, very immediately, you will get it. What will you get it? Adhika chati, you will go to the, place, param sthanu. Na chiren, it will not take, long, time. This is a, guarantee, Krishna's, guarantee. So, you know, news, news day, so, Modi's guarantee. This is Krishna's guarantee. Modi cannot give this guarantee. Nobody can give this guarantee. Even, Indra cannot give this guarantee. Brahma cannot give this guarantee. Krishna can give this guarantee. He said, na chiren, immediately.

**Summary:** The speaker offers another guarantee from Krishna: even those who cannot practice rigorous yoga can achieve liberation simply by faithfully hearing from realized souls.

What we have to do? Just become, Krishna conscious. Madh gaten antaraatmana, yog yukto. Krishna, you know, saying, going to Himalaya, nothing. Even, sannyas are not required. It's all, dukha. Now, what if somebody, doesn't know, what to do, in life? There are, so many people, who are not aware, about this, spiritual life. They may not be, aware, of this, spiritual life. They may not be, aware, may not be, so much curious also, to know. May not be intelligent, to understand. What happens to them? Their case is hopeless. Krishna says, no, nobody's case is hopeless. Another guarantee, Krishna gives, in 13th chapter. There are people, who may not be, able to, renounce the world, go to Himalayas, may not become, that kind of yogi. They simply, hear, from, a qualified person. So, tibhya, and nirbhya, listen, from others, who are, Krishna conscious, who are, realized soul. Sunuti, parayana, we all, fall in this, category, because, we are, able to hear, we are fortunate, to know, to hear, from, Prabhupada. If we, continue, this tendency, to hear, Prabhupada, very seriously, then, what will happen? Mithyam, atitaranti eva, we will, cross over, the mithyam, the phase of death, we go beyond it. We will achieve, anavritti, we need to come back.

**Key Quote:** "Just by, giving a faithful hearing, to what Prabhupada says, what his scriptures says, what Krishna says, what Subhdev Goswami says... very soon, we can go back to paramsthan."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the power of hearing Srimad Bhagavatam with faith, comparing it to the autumnal rain that cleanses muddy water, and emphasizing its role in achieving liberation.

That's what, Parichit Maharaj, is going to do, now, seven days. Today, what it says, Sukte Goswami, is saying, you have seven days, to do it. What he's going to do it? He's not going to Himalayas. What he's going to do? Sunuti, parayana. He's going to hear. But we should hear, with faith. Saddhavan, labhite jnanam, tat parah, samyate indriyaha, jnanam labdhabhavam, santim, achrena di dakshati. Again, the word, achrena. There, another sloka, which we read before, naachrena, not too long. Here, achrena, very short, the abode of achrena. Just by, giving a faithful hearing, to what Prabhupada says, what his scriptures says, what Krishna says, what Subhdev Goswami says. Achrena, very soon, we can go back to paramsthan. Achrena adi dakshati. Simar Bhagavatam, same canto, which we are reading, second canto, which says, the sound incarnation of Lord Krishna, the super soul, enters into the heart of self-realized devotee, sits on the lotus flower of his loving relationship, and thus, cleanses the dust of material association, such as, lust, anger, and hankering. Thus, it acts like an autumnal rain, upon pool of muddy water. So, we have seen the ponds, with muddy water, but when the rain happens, in the autumn season, all the mud settles down, and we see Krishna clear water. Same effect happens, when we hear, the sound representation of Krishna, that is, Srimad Bhagavatam.

**Key Quote:** "Without discussing the glories of uttam sloka with Krishna, the sunrise and sunset is just taking away our lives."
**Summary:** The speaker urges listeners to regularly hear Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing that without discussing Krishna, the passage of time simply diminishes our life duration.

So, you have option, either you can go to Himalayas, or forest, or you can just hear Simar Bhagavatam, sound representation of Krishna. Which one you will choose? Srimad Bhagavatam. So, every day, we should hear. But if the Maharaj had seven days, we don't even know whether we have seven days. Right? We don't have any guarantee card in our pocket, that we have seven days. And with faith, we don't even know whether we have seven days. That's why, nityam bhagavata sevaya. Regularly, we should hear the message of Srimad Bhagavatam. Somehow, we are fortunate that we came in touch with Prabhupada, a pure devotee, that we are getting the message as it is. There are so many people who might be reading so many scriptures, but they are not getting as it is. We are fortunate. And still, if we do not read, reading is unfortunate. Which is a very rare opportunity. So everybody should read. If we don't read, what will happen? If we don't become Krishna conscious, if we don't hear about Krishna, we don't talk about Krishna, what will happen? We are simply wasting our life duration. Okay. Somebody has sent me some clips on WhatsApp. What are those clips? Those clips are the last sunset of 2035. From Kanyakumari. Somebody from Himalaya somewhere. And the next day again I got some more clips. The first sunrise of 2036. And people enjoy all these things. And they don't know this sunset and sunrise is taking their life duration. It is mentioned in the Bahasa in the same canto, second canto, third chapter, seventeenth sloka. Ayur harati vaipumsam Udayan astam chayan aso tas rite yat chhano nita uttam sloka vartaya. So without discussing the glories of uttam sloka with Krishna the sunrise and sunset is just taking away our lives. Ayur harati ayur means the life duration. Harati means it's just taken. So we are just missing out this opportunity. This rare

human life. Bhagavatam gives one very good analogy. If we do not use our body, our this is called instrument, Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita, yantra, we don't use it for Krishna's service to hear about Krishna, to talk about Krishna, to think about Krishna, to serve us. But we can don't use it at all. But we don't use it for our needs. We understand this is the best machine in the world is human body, the best machine they cannot make a machine like this. Whatever they are trying can replicate some of it's functionalities by making some Rovers are not making efficient use somebody said no we are making efficient use so many people they pass but in olympics you know they use this machine very nicely jumping like this but they're going to space that's not the use bhagavatam says the second canto karna pute karna pute means the ears our ears are like bile bat bil means the hole of the snake goes underground and he lives and it's called bil karna pute bil bat it is like a bill of a hole of a snake when naasirvataha uruktramabhikramanyeh if these ears do not hear the glories of Bhagavad Gita be heard then the ears will almost of all your ears where all the knowledge if these ears do not hear the glories of Bhagavad Gita hear the glories of the Bhagavad Gita krishna the adventures pastime of krishna they are just like a snake holes the holes of this similarly it talks about tongue jiva it says it is means frog our tongue is like a frog's tongue you know what frogs do prabhupada says in the rainy season it makes sound and that sound attracts a snake to come and eat it is they get to know from where the sound is coming it goes and eat it in the rainy season so jiva is it's like a frog's tongue when if it is not used to glorify now if it isn't praises krishna's pastimes and it is like a frog's time on me we are just using it to invite our death one day

body has a lot of anger head is called the uttamanga the best is like very heavy burden is a burden on our body if if it doesn't go down to mukunda it's just a burden on the body naine naine means eyes eyes are like but how you think about the body naine naine means eyes naan what we are unable to see the mystery of what war broke for them only if you can see it but if we're yeah about what it is that he even said it's a broken record also you see the the the the the jiva its its an discern if there is senses of the eyes now as a Tensorate ahh here Nani rikshita, we do not observe. Lingyani vishnu, the form of the Lord. Pada, pada means the legs. They are compared to dhruma, dhruma means tree trunk, the trunk of the tree. When, if they do not do what? Yes, big image. Na anubhrajato kshetrani hare, they do not go to the holy places where the Lord has performed his pastimes. Na anubhrajato, they do not go to kshetrani hare, the places of pastime of the Lord. And finally the heart. Hridayam, heart is compared to asamsaram. It is like a steel frame, frame of a steel. If, na vikrayatatha, if it does not melt. When, harinamadheyam, when you hear about the holy name or the glories of the Lord and if your heart does not melt, it is like a steel frame. So this name here, 2026. This would make sure that we do justice to this human form of life which we have got. And how to do this? Just do not repeat whatever is mentioned here. Don't, like here it says, if you don't go to the holy places then your legs are like titra. Don't do that. Go to the holy places. Na abhigayanti, if you don't sing the praises of the Lord, the glories of the Lord, then tongue is like frog tongue. Don't make it like a frog tongue. Make use of it, this rare resource called human body, human intellect. And just like Parichit Maharaj has made his life perfect, ana vrittim, by hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam for seven days. Just like Khatvanga has done it just for one moment, one muhrata. The destiny of the murtas are given in different ways. Some say some minutes, some seconds. Similarly, we should also make good use of our human body, human intellect by hearing and chanting.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by encouraging the audience to make a New Year's resolution to use each part of their body in the service of the Lord, seeking the blessings of the deities to fulfill this resolution.

When we do hearing and chanting, it results in something. It results in smaranam. Srimad-Bhagavatam and Kirtan result in smaranam. And that is the required thing. Madh Gaten Antaraatmana Yogayukto Maan Smaranam. And that can happen by Srimad-Bhagavatam and Kirtan. So please, do read Bhagavatam. Please chant the holy name. Associate with devotees. And engage in the service. Whenever you come to the temple, please try to use your hands in the service of the Lord. Oh, I think I didn't tell you about the hands. Karao. Karao means hands. They are like sabh. Sabh means a dead body. A dead person's hand. If na kurute sabhar paya hare. Na kurute sabhar yaam hare. If they are not engaged in the service of the Lord. Worshipping the Lord. Whenever we come to temple, we make sure. When you are coming to temple, you are doing justice with your legs. You are coming to a place where Lord is glorified. And when you engage in the service, you are doing justice to your hands. When you are hearing Bhagavatam class, you are doing justice to your ears. When you are chanting or preaching to somebody, you are doing justice to your tongue. And when you experience ecstasy in your heart. After hearing the glories of the Lord, after chanting His name. By participating in the kirtan. By having the darshan of the Lord. Then you are doing justice to your heart. So generally, in new year, we take resolutions. Correct? New year resolutions. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't work. But if we pray to the deities. I will take resolution that I will do justice to each part of my body. As mentioned in the second canto of Sinha Bhagavatam. That with the blessings of the deity and Gau Paha. Our resolution will be perfect and they will make our life perfect. So how many of you are going to take this resolution? That you will do justice with your ears, your tongue. Your hands, your legs, your heart. Everybody? I don't see some hands going up. The people know that their resolution will not work. That's why we have to pray to the deities. Today after prasadam, please go to the main temple hall. Pray to the deities. In front of the deities. Back from them. That I want to take this resolution. I don't want to make my ears like a snake holes. My tongue like a frog's tongue. My hands like a dead man's hand. Or my legs like a tree trunk. Or my heart like a steel frame. This will be our resolution. Sinha Bhagavatam ki Jai.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 2, Chapter 5, Verse 26-29. I will read myself. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 2, Chapter 5, Verse 26-29. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "Because the star is transformed, the air is generated with the quality of touch. And by previous succession, the air is also full of sound and the basic principle of duration of life, sense perception, mental power, and bodily strength. When the air is transformed in course of time and nature's course, fire is generated, taking shape with the sense of touch and sound. Since fire is also transformed, there is a manifestation of water full of juice and taste. As previously, it also has form and touch and is also full of sound. And water being transformed from all life on Earth appears anew in order and as previously becomes qualitatively full of juice, touch, sound and form respectively."

**Key Quote:** "So in the same way Lord Brahma who is the director of this universe creator of the universe he is doing the set design"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a film director to explain how Lord Brahma creates the universe and assigns roles to living entities.

Suppose, let's say I'm a film director and I'm planning a film, and in that film I want some of you to become the king, some of you to become the queen, some of you to become warriors, some of you to become an invader, a villain who will come and do all nonsense, all wrong things, and some of you soldiers. And so now, in filmmaking, there is one important step after the script, casting, all that is done, that's called set design. Because it's a story of a king, queen, all this, we need a palace, we need a battleground, we need horses, we need elephants, we need soldiers. Next, as a film director, I'll start planning all of this so that when we turn on the lights and all of you can act out very correctly, the king will play his role, the queen will play her role, and then the invader will come and all the different things will, as per the story, will unfold. So in the same way, Lord Brahma, who is the director of this universe, creator of the universe, he is doing the set design.

**Summary:** The speaker raises the fundamental question of why we are part of this worldly drama and emphasizes that people are usually too engrossed in their roles to contemplate the deeper meaning.

So a fundamental question is, why are we all part of this drama? But this is like a, this, okay, that's like a drama, cinema is all right, but this looks like real life. This doesn't look like drama. No, actually it is a fact. What is a drama, what is a cinema? After some time, the curtains will close and the lights are turned off and the drama ends. So even in our lives, one day the curtain will be drawn, the lights will be turned off, our drama will end, but it doesn't appear like that. It looks like real, you know, this is my wife, this is my husband, this is my home, this is my father, this is my mother, these are my children, this is my house. Why all of this has come about? These are deeper questions. One is, you are a king, play properly your role as a king. You, queen, play properly queen as a role as a queen, do your proper, be a strong king, all that is one thing. But a very fundamental, deeper question is, why have I become an actor in this drama? But very rarely people think, they are all busy with their roles, they have to play mother, father, husband, wife, and they want to play it out nicely so that everybody is impressed with the role I am playing. We rarely think why this drama is going on.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that we are all spirit souls playing different roles in this material world, designed by Lord Brahma, and questions why the soul has become entrapped.

literatures, we get an understanding of this. We are all spirit souls. Just like in the drama or in the cinema, there is a set designer and makeup artist, costume designer. The costume designer will design for the king, you have to play the role of a king, so you should look like a king. You, she must look like a queen. All the costume design will happen. The palace is built. Brahma is doing all this. You should get a male body, you should get a female body, you should look like this, you should look like this, trees, plants. But inside this body is the spirit soul. We are the spirit soul. We are playing the role of a man, of a woman, of an animal, of a bird for some time and then the drama ends. And then we will be an actor, after he finishes one drama, he'll get commissioned to do another drama. So we will get another opportunity, we will go to another situation. Now the Vedic literatures provides a very, very significant perspective, why have we become part of this drama? What is this going on? And that is, we are all spirit souls, we take on this body and the body has male body, female body, animal body has designed by a by Lord Brahma, the creator of all this.

**Key Quote:** "And this Jeeva Shakti has developed a desire, I want to be independent of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that we are all part of Krishna, but unlike sunlight which cannot be independent of the sun, we have developed the desire to be independent.

Why has the soul become entrapped like this and playing this different role? Very nicely Prabhupada has written in the purport, previous purport. As an Amsha, we are all spirit soul, Amsha of Krishna. Just like there is sunlight. Sunlight has come into the room but some minutes back it was in the sun and it has come all the way and traveled here. Isn't it? We understand that. Now can the sun, sunshine, sunlight, is it possible for the sunlight to be independent of the sun? Can sunlight exist without the sun? Not possible at all, isn't it? Constitutionally, it is not possible. The sunlight is an emanation of the sun. In the same way, we are all living entities. We are all conscious entities coming from Krishna. We are all living entities. We are all conscious entities coming from Krishna. We are all living entities. We are all conscious entities coming from Krishna. We are all conscious entities coming from Krishna. But, this conscious entities have developed one desire. Sunshine has no desire. It is just light energy. Whereas, we are also energy, Jeeva Shakti of the Lord. And this Jeeva Shakti has developed a desire, I want to be independent of Krishna. I want to be independent of Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "This desire of the living entity to be independent of Krishna is called unconstitutional desire."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the unconstitutional desire to be independent of Krishna, comparing it to a dream where sunlight can exist without the sun, and how Krishna creates the illusion of the material world to facilitate this desire.

I want to be independent of Krishna. I want to be independent of Krishna. Krishna. Just like sunlight has come from sun, we are also Jeeva Shakti coming from Krishna, the Shaktimaan. But the difference is that is a inert, lifeless energy, light energy, heat energy. Whereas we are a Shakti which has got Chetana, consciousness. And this Chetana Shakti, Chit Shakti has developed a desire because it's Chetana. Chetana means has desire, has thinking, feeling. And this Chit Shakti has developed a desire, I must be independent of Krishna. It is not possible. Sunshine cannot be independent of the sun. It is an emanation of the sun. This desire of the living entity to be independent of Krishna is called unconstitutional desire. It is not constitutional. It is not by our makeup. How we are composed, how we are formed, what are we made of? We are made of Krishna's energy. We have come from Krishna. So we can never sever that. But we have developed a desire. I want to be independent of Krishna. This is possible only in illusion. For example, we can think of sunshine without sun in our dream. We can say last night I had a dream, you know, there was so much sunlight. I looked up at the sky and I didn't see the sun at all. But there was sunshine. Yes, such a thing is possible in illusory dream. Dream will go away. It's a temporary existence in the night. And when we wake up, it's all gone. Right? In the same way, Krishna through Brahma creates an illusion of this world for the living entities to give an impression that we are independent of Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses how many people recognize God but primarily seek His blessings to fulfill their own independent desires and ambitions.

We are here in the material world. But among the living entities here, some of them have some God consciousness. So they recognize God, they go to temples, they worship, they follow some religion, some Dharma. But they follow religion, they follow Dharma. But they follow religion, they follow Dharma. With an aim that God will bless me so that all my various desires I have with my family, with my profession, with myself, I can fulfill all those desires with God's blessing. This is the large population of the society thinks like this. Recognize God. But I have my desires and I should fulfill my desires, my ambitions with God's blessing. But then the reality is that we are a spirit, chetana shakti, coming from Krishna. We rarely think, what is Krishna's plan for me? What does Krishna want me to do? I have come into this world, I am playing different roles. But our spirit of independence is such that I am here, I am independent, I have my independent desires and ambitions. And God is there, I want God's blessing to fulfill my independent desires. You see, I want to be independent is manifested in the spirit of I want to have independent desires.

**Key Quote:** "Rarely we think, if I am part and parcel of Krishna, I have come from Krishna, what was Krishna's plan for me?"
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts pursuing independent desires with aligning oneself with Krishna's plan, highlighting the initial stage of recognizing God as a fulfiller of personal dreams.

That's what we pursue. We have our plans. We get inputs from the society, from newspapers, from the heroes of the world, from different sources. And we form our ambitions and we have to do that. And we want to pursue. These are my desires, my ambition. Rarely we think, if I am part and parcel of Krishna, I have come from Krishna, what was Krishna's plan for me? This is the kind of an independent desire that we want to have. Because we want this desire, the independent desire, the independent existence, which is unconstitutional. Krishna creates an illusion in the material world. Gives us different roles and gives us an opportunity to play out our role, trying to be independent. That is the situation of the material world. That is what is happening here. So we take on different roles. I am man, I am woman, this is the family, this is my business. I must have a house, I must have big house. I must have big car, I must have big bank balance. And we work for all these things. Rarely we think, if we are all children of God, what does God want us to do? When we start thinking, what does God want? Can I know that? Can I align myself with God's intention? That is called Sharanagati. That is the next level of recognition of God. In the first stage, where we recognize God, I have my independent desires, I have my independent plans. I want God's blessing so that I can succeed in my own plan.

**Key Quote:** "What does Krishna want me to do? If I am his."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of Sharanagati (surrender) and aligning one's desires with Krishna's plan, referencing the Bhagavad Gita's teaching on surrendering to Krishna.

This is also recognition of God, but a relatively very minimal recognition. God as a supplier of my dreams, as a fulfiller of my dreams. My dreams. It's my dream. And God shall kindly fulfill my dreams. See, this is the large population of the world, in every religion. This is the consciousness of the living entity. The next level Krishna teaches in the Bhagavad Gita, in the Vedic literatures, is that, if you are part and parcel of me, Krishna. We are all part and parcel of Krishna. We have come from Krishna. We are an energy of Krishna. What does Krishna want me to do? What is his plan for me? If I am his. If I am his. If I am his. So, this is how Bhagavad Gita ends, by bringing the concept of Sarva-Dharman-Paridhyajya. Ma mekam sharanam vraja. We must surrender to Krishna. We must align our desires, our plans, our activities, with Krishna's activity.

**Key Quote:** "This is a drama. It's only a drama relationship. No substance."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that after surrender, one understands their true relationship with Krishna, contrasting it with the temporary and insubstantial relationships in the material world.

And then what happens? Then, Bhagavatam describes further, after sharanagati, after you align, you will come to understand, you have a relation with Krishna. Relation. Relation is a very powerful thing. Just like somebody is a mother, there is a child. The mother is always conscious, I should take care of my child. And child also, playing around a little bit, if some difficulty, some danger comes, mummy, she will run to the mother, and hold on to the mother. That's the meaning of relationship. There is activity. There is feelings. So, now we, next the Vedic literatures inform us, we have a relation with Krishna. What about all these relationships in the material world? This is a drama. It's only a drama relationship. No substance. Just like in the dream also, we sometimes have so many relationships, so many activities. When we wake up in the morning, all the relationship, all the activities has no meaning. Say in the drama, I earn one crore rupees, and I put it safely into the bank. I am feeling very good. One crore rupees in the bank now. The alarm rings, and then I wake up. Will I run to the bank? Let me draw the one crore rupees. No. It's a dream. It has no substance. Same thing will happen to us, when our life's alarm rings, and we go out of this world. Where is all this relationship? Where is my house? Everything is gone.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of Ahamkara (false ego/identity) as the root of our entanglement, contrasting it with the true identity of being part and parcel of Krishna.

Reset to a new situation. So for all this, very nicely Bhagavatam brings out the primary principle is called Ahamkara. See that's how this Bhagavad, this verse began. So ahamkara iti prokto vikurvan samabhutritha. It all begins with ahamkara. Ahamkara means what? The living entity having a false identity. Usually in our normal language, ahamkara, don't have so much ahamkara. Somebody is very proud, very arrogant, we say that. Right? Yeah, that's okay. It's in one sense. The real sense of the word ahamkara, aham, my identity. My identity truly is I am a part and parcel of Krishna. But now I have developed a false identity. I am independent of Krishna. I have my own life. I have my own plans. I have my own ambitions. I have my own aspirations. And I want to fulfill all these things. And there is God. I understand. I am a pious person. I am a God fearing, God believing person. I need God's blessing to fulfill all my things, my ambitions. But these ambitions are independent of God's plan. I don't know. God is meant for, you know, for fulfilling my desires. That is God. This kind of a recognition of God to sharanagati, to God. And next, I have a relation with God. And that is a true relation. And all these relations are without substance. It's a temporary relation. And I must come to experience that relation which is substantial, which is true, which is real. And that experience and percept, understanding and experience of that relationship

**Summary:** The speaker defines Bhakti as the understanding and experience of our true, intense, and loving relationship with Krishna.

is called bhakti. And that bhakti relationship can become intense. Just like relationships can be very intense between people sometimes. Sometimes, even grown-up men, they have very intense relation with their father and mother. We could have come across such people. Of course, between husband and wife, there could be an intense relation. Between children and parents, there is intense. We all have experienced that. When we had to leave our homes and join ISKCON, join temple, our heart was pulling, father, mother. It was very intense. You see? But these are, all these are drama relationships which we are thinking, it's so intense, it is this, that, all that. It's a drama. Not true. But the truth is that we have an intense, true relationship with Krishna. It is an intense, loving relationship with Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "The living entity has desire to be independent. Now Lord has to fulfill that. It is not possible to fulfill that. Because it is an unconstitutional desire."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how Brahma creates the material world to fulfill the living entity's desire to be independent, even though it's an unconstitutional desire.

So, Bhagavatam is preparing us to understand all this and describing here how Brahma created all these sets in the form of the body, in the form of the dress for the body, in the form of the palace, in the form of the houses, and in modern world, in the form of my factory, my shop, my bank, my bank balance, my car. All these different things have come about. That's why, it is very nicely described here in this verse. Sohankara iti prokto vikurvan samabhut tridha. This ahankara, the false identity the living entity wants to take up. The living entity has desire to be independent. Now Lord has to fulfill that. It is not possible to fulfill that. Because it is an unconstitutional desire. It can only be fulfilled in a dreamlike situation. That is why, Srila Prabhupada gives another example of an unconstitutional desire. There was a child. Child, you know children, they become cranky sometimes. They cry, cry so much. They are small children. And the mother is trying to pacify the child, put the child to sleep. Not able to do anything. So when such things happen, you know, in homes, the mother brought the child, you know, sometimes due to heat also, the children go cranky. So she brought the child out of the house in the night. And hoping that, you know, cool, little cool breeze, child will become alright. The child was still very cranky. And now the child looked at the sky and there was the moon. And now the child started demanding, get me the moon. I want the moon. So the mother is very perplexed. What is this? How can I get the moon? Moon is in the sky. The child's desire is an unconstitutional desire. It is not possible for the child to get the moon from the sky. Impossible. It is not in line with the composition and what the child is made of, what the moon is made of.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a child wanting the moon to illustrate how Krishna creates an illusory world to satisfy our unconstitutional desires for independence.

But the child has developed a desire. The father was an intelligent man. He was watching all this, how the wife, mother is struggling with the child and the child demanding the moon. The father, what he did, he went and brought one big mirror. He said, I want the moon. And the child saw the reflection of the moon in the mirror. And the child saw, oh, the moon is there. And the child was holding the mirror and the child became satisfied. Now I got the moon. Actually the child did not get the moon, got a reflection of the moon. We are related to Krishna, we are meant to have a serving relationship with Krishna but we have developed a desire, I want to be independent, I want to enjoy, I have my plans, I want to have nice relationship in the material world without Krishna. So Krishna has said, all right, I will create an illusory world with illusory forms, with illusory relationships, with illusory activities and we become busy here.

This is what is happening to us. Very few people know this truth from the Shastra. Our great Acharyas have presented this to make us understand. This is what is happening to us here. So this is the, how this, and for the, you know when you have to play the role of a king, someone has to play the role of a queen, somebody has an enemy, palace and finally why the cinema film, director is making all this so that the viewers will come and look, oh such a nice cinema it was. King he played his role where you look at the king, look at the palace he had, they should appreciate. So that there is a sense of realism. In the same way, Lord Brahma is creating this material world, minutely tweaking it to get a sense of realism for the audience. The sense of realism for us, the sense of rupa, forms, the sense of gandha, smell, the sense of taste, rasa, the sense of sparsha, soft, touch, the sense of sound, you see because

of these things. Rasa, gandha, smell. Because of this we are having an experience. So Brahma is minutely designing and creating all these experiences so that it looks like a real world for us. Actually it's a, it's a temporary world. We have to remember this. This is endless. This is enlightenment. This is enlightenment, that this is the truth. What is true is this body is not truth, it will go away. The spirit soul, that is eternal. And that spirit soul has a relation with Krishna. So Srimad Bhagavatam is preparing us for all this understanding gradually. Gradually telling how the material creation is coming about. How the sets are being prepared for the actors to play the role in the same way how the material world is being created for the conditioned souls to come and play different roles in this material world. That's the sub, someone's substance. So there is one very nice statement by Srila Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada, in the previous purport, I'll read that, where is that, oh it's here. Factually, save and accept the Lord, no one can be called the enjoyer. Krishna alone is the enjoyer. Save and accept the Lord, save and accept the Lord, no one can be called the enjoyer, but the living entity falsely desires to become the enjoyer. This is the origin of false ego.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the most confidential knowledge revealed by Krishna in the 9th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing that Krishna is the master and enjoyer of everything.

This is the origin of ahamkara. This is the important truth Krishna reveals in the 9th chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. In the beginning of the chapter, 9th chapter, Krishna said, idam tu te guhyam pravakshyam anasuyave. Idam tu te guhyam pravakshyam anasuyave. Idam tu te guhyam pravakshyam anasuyave. I am going to tell you the most confidential knowledge. Pravakshyam anasuyave dhyana vigyana sahitam yajnatva mokshase ashubhata. And if you know this truth, you will be freed from all inauspiciousness. What is that truth? Most confidential truth Krishna has revealed in the 9th chapter. There are many aspects of the truth. One of them he is aham hi sarvayagnanam bhogtacha prabhurevaca. This is I am the master, I am the enjoyer of everyone's activities and sacrifices. Natumam abhijananti tatvenathas cavantite. One who don't accept this, I am the master and I am the enjoyer. This is the truth about me. This is the tattva. One who does not accept this. They come to this material world, in this world of illusion. This is the most difficult thing for people to accept. I am not the enjoyer, Krishna is the enjoyer. Or somebody may get an impression, oh Krishna is the enjoyer, I am not the enjoyer. That means Krishna is the enjoyer. And I am what? Sufferer is it? Because opposite of enjoyment is suffering, no? Krishna is the enjoyer. What about me? Krishna is the enjoyer, I am the sufferer. No. By serving him, we will get our enjoyment. That is our pleasure. Not independently trying to be the enjoyer. Krishna is the supreme. The supreme enjoyer. Bhokta cha prabhu revacha. He is the bhokta, he is the prabhu. We must accept. This is the most confidential knowledge that Krishna is describing.

**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about free will, explaining that it is necessary for love to exist and that our turning away from Krishna leads to independent desires and entrapment in Maya.

When do we have a free will? And what percentage of free will we are having? Sorry. Why do we have a free will? And what is the percentage of free will we have? Okay, I will answer that. Okay, why do we have free will? See, we were just discussing that we have a relationship with Krishna. And that relationship is loving relationship, bhakti. For love to happen, freedom is required. Just like if I say, I show a gun at you and say, love me or else, you will get scared. I love you. Please let me go. There won't be true love. There is a saying, love cannot come from the barrel of a gun. So, for love, real love to exist, there has to be free will, freedom. So, Jeeva, we have come from Krishna. We are amsa of Krishna. Krishna is fully independent. Swarat. His position. We are amsa. We have small level of independence. We have free will to a small extent. Why Krishna has given that free will to us? Because he wants us to use the free will correctly and love him. But the option exists. If we don't want, we can turn away from him. That is what we are all doing. We have come into this world. Krishna bahirmukha. We have turned away from Krishna. We have come into this material world. Bhogavanchakare. Krishna bahirmukha. Bhogavanchakare. Nikatasta maya. Japati adhare. Very close. When we turn away from Krishna, the first symptom is, we develop independent desires. And moment we develop independent desires, Krishna creates an illusory world. And maya captures us to this world. That is what has happened to us.

Now, to what extent, what percentage, you said? Okay. All living entities have have have free will. But that free will is most 100% manifest in human life. And in human life, in sattvic life, it is 100% manifest. In rajasic life, may be little lesser. Tamasic life, even lesser. And animal life, even lesser. Plant life, the least. That's why you see plants, they just grow. They stand there. Practically, they have no volition. They don't have an ability. No, I want to be here. Animal, at least they can. No, I don't want to be in this room. I want to go there. They can run around. They are moving living entities. Birds can fly. There is a little bit more expression of freedom. And that expression of freedom is most in human beings. And if somebody is a little more enlightened and he has got a life, tranquil, peaceful life, he is more free. I can do many things. I can plan to do. You see, that's called sattva guna. So, you can see manifestation of free will according to the different forms, life forms. And it is most manifest in human body. And that's why human beings, we can understand all these ultimate truth and come out of this illusory world. Animals don't have that ability to come out of the illusion. They are just stuck in the illusion. We can come out of that illusion with proper knowledge from the shastra, from the acharyas. That is the possibility open to human beings. We will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna teaches that we must understand that there is a body and there is a spirit soul residing in the body."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the fundamental concept of the spirit soul being distinct from the body, drawing from the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize the soul's eternal nature and the body's temporary existence.

But everyone should have a spiritual purpose because we must understand our composition in our present situation. This is the first teaching of the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna teaches that we must understand that there is a body and there is a spirit soul residing in the body. The spirit soul is distinct and different from the body. That is why one day this body can have a heart attack or some other kind of a big disease, and finally I will die. When I die, my body will be lying there. The body that everybody was relating with will be lying there. But then people will say, "Oh, he is gone." Who has gone? What has gone? The spirit has gone. So, there is a dual situation here. There is the body and there is the spirit soul. Because of the presence of the spirit soul, the body is animated. I can sing, I can speak, I can do work, I can think, I can solve problems. All this I can do because of the presence of the spirit soul. When the soul leaves the body, it's a dead body. It is just carried and set on fire into ashes. Nothing more can be done with it when the soul has left the body. But the soul, Krishna teaches, is eternal: na jayate namriyate vā kadācin na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the importance of understanding and exploring our spiritual potential, contrasting it with our usual focus on bodily goals and relationships.

And so, we must realize that this body is just an external, temporary covering for the soul. And what happens is, we don't understand these things. We only have goals and purposes and aspirations connected with the body, and my things connected, relations with the body. So, spirituality is about understanding and exploring our spiritual potential, our spiritual aspect of life. And everyone is supposed to do this.

**Key Quote:** "We must have one track called spiritual development track."
**Summary:** The speaker suggests integrating spiritual development as one of the multiple tracks in our lives, alongside professional and personal pursuits, to cultivate a spiritual purpose.

And when you have spiritual purpose, one may think that what will happen to my profession? No. That can also go on. Profession can go on and our spiritual progress also can go on. We can run our lives on multiple tracks. All people do that. People run, they have their professional life, they have their personal life, and they have some hobbies, some music, something they'll be practicing, cultivating. They have that and another track. So, life runs on multiple tracks. And we must have one track called spiritual development track. And we may do many other things: our professional life, personal life. Along with this, we should fire another track in our lives called the spiritual understanding and spiritual development track. And in this way, we can bring in a spiritual purpose to our lives. Not just the professional purpose, personal purpose, and some hobbies and such things.

King Pariksit wondered how a person so attached to wife, children, and home could become so perfectly Krishna conscious. Prahalad Maharaj has said, Matirna Krishne Paratasvatova Mithobi Padhyeta Grihavrata Nam A Grihavrata, one who has taken a vow to execute family duties, has no chance to become Krishna conscious. This is because most Grihavratas are guided by sense gratification and therefore gradually glide down to the darkest regions of material existence. Adanta Ghovir Vishatam Tamisram. How can they possibly become perfect in Krishna consciousness? Maharaj Pariksit asked Shukadeva Goswami to resolve this great doubt.

So we are seeing in the first chapter of fifth canto questions asked by Pariksit to Shukadeva Goswami. He heard about Priyavrata becoming perfect in Krishna consciousness and so that has triggered a thought. And in today's verse he is saying, Samsa Yoham Mahan Brahman. This is my Mahan Samshaya. This is my great doubt. Brahman, O Brahmana, referring to Shukadeva Goswami, O great Shukadeva Goswami. Dara Gara Sutadishu Saktasya Yatsiddhirabhut. Dara, wife, Agara, home, Suta, children, Adishu. This is what happens in a human, in a Grahasta life. One becomes attached to wife, home, and children. Dara Gara Sutadishu Saktasya. One becomes attached. Asakti, sakta, one who has become attached. Yatsiddhirabhut. But you are also saying, Yet Siddhirabhut. But you are also saying, He achieved perfection. Siddhi. Perfection. And what kind of Siddhi? Krishnecha Mathirajyutha Mathihi, Prabhupada has here translated as became attachment. His mind, his consciousness became attached. Mathirajyutha. To Krishna. Krishnecha Mathirajyutha. To Krishna. Krishnecha Mathirajyutha. To Krishna. So this is very surprising that he became Krishne Mathihi. He became attached to Krishna. Became Krishna conscious. So the king continued, O great Brahmana, Brahman, This is my great doubt. Samsa Yoyam Mahan Brahman. How was it possible, For a person like King Priyavrata, Who was so attached, Saktasya, To wife, Dara, Children, Suta, And home, Agaara, To achieve the topmost infallible perfection, Achutasiddhihi. Infallible perfection. In Krishna consciousness, Krishnemathihi.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of the quest for perfection in human life, noting that without spiritual knowledge, people often misinterpret what true perfection is.

Some important points, Prabhupada has pointed out, In the translation, in the purport. So, Siddhihi. Perfection in life. Siddhirabhut. Perfection came about in his life. Priyavrata's life. And what was his life about? He was Dara, Agaara, Suta, Dishu, Saktasya. He was attached to wife, children, home, And all of that. He had a big family, Big palace. He was a king. All of that. And how he became perfect? So, First of all, we must appreciate that there is a, There should be a search for perfection in human life. And, That quest, Understanding, And attainment of that perfection, Should be the, Dominant aspect of human life. But of course, when we are not enlightened, When we have no spiritual knowledge, We don't know what is perfection. There are many people in the world, Trying to, Very, very passionately, Pursue some perfection in their life. Someone is trying to become a big politician. Someone is trying to become a big businessman. Someone may be trying to become a big scholar. Someone may be trying to become a famous person. So sometimes people have these conceptions, Or not sometimes, Most of the times. People have some conception like this. And they are very devoted to that perfection. I must achieve that. So, Quest for perfection is not a, Quest for perfection is not an unusual thing. In human society, Even in our Kali Yuga society, That quest for perfection is there.

**Key Quote:** "But then, where is he now? Where is that person?"
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the transience of material achievements like power and fame by referencing historical figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Napoleon, questioning their current relevance.

Because all of these perfections, Like becoming rich, becoming powerful, This world has seen many, many powerful people, Rich people, successful people, famous people. Prabhupada used to often mention, Wherever Gandhiji went, Because Prabhupada was a contemporary of Gandhiji. Of course, Gandhiji was a few decades older. But Prabhupada had seen, And Gandhiji was a very, very famous and very powerful person. And wherever he went, Wherever he went, People would be glorifying, Bapuji, Bapu, Bapu, Like that. And, Sometimes, Gandhiji would get so fed up, Of people screaming, He would close his ears. They are all screaming, shouting. He would close his ears. And we know that, When finally Gandhiji was assassinated, And then, His procession of his body was being taken, For the final rites in Delhi, New Delhi. You must have seen pictures. Thousands and thousands, And probably lakhs of people, Participating in that. So you can see how powerful he was. But then, Where is he now? Where is that person? Of course, In our country, Every city has, A road named after him. Right? But mostly, It has all become MG Road, And many people don't even know what MG Road is. Right? So this is what happens to, Powerful, Powerful people. Okay, Mahatma Gandhi is in a, In one sense, Quite recent memory, We may say. If you take hundreds of years before that, There were very powerful kings, Napoleon, They were also very powerful, In their own countries, In their own kingdoms. But what is their power now?

Nothing remains. Adyantavantakaunteya. It has a beginning, And it has an end. But interestingly, We are all attracted to these things. Power, Influence, Fame, Learning. It's a fact that these features attract us. Somehow, Inherently, We are attracted to that. If somebody is very powerful, Somebody is rich, Just like, If somebody's son is going to, Son or daughter is going to America, That family, They'll say, Neighbors, friends, My son is going to America. Right? Big thing. Suppose their son got a job in Africa, And he's going. Our son is going. It's not so attractive. You see, America is a, Attractive country. Powerful country. So we are attracted. And that's how Srila Prabhupada explains, The Shastras explain, Krishna has all these opulences to an unlimited extent. And hence, He becomes captivating. That absolute truth has all of these attractive qualities, By which one can be drawn. And hence, That absolute truth, Has the name, Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Just like we have to be devoted, to our partial cause, Father and mother, we should also be, Absolutely devoted, To our absolute cause, Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker draws an analogy between devotion to parents (partial cause) and devotion to Krishna (absolute cause), arguing that we should be absolutely devoted to Krishna as our ultimate source.

Because, We are all, Coming from the Absolute Truth. If somebody is attached to his father and mother, They will say it is a natural thing. If somebody is not at all attached, Then something, What is this? He is not caring for his father, Caring for his mother. They will say like that. Because, We have come from our father and mother, To love them, To show affection to them, And to serve them, Is considered the right thing. But then, Our father and mother, They are, Our source, Our cause, To a limited extent. Not to an unlimited extent. Not the complete cause, A partial cause. So, If we, This is a philosophical aspect, We have to, We have to reflect on it. Yes, What caused me? My father and mother caused me. Now what caused my father and mother? My grandfather, And grandmother, They caused my father, My mother. So in other words, They are, My father and mother were, It's a chain of causes and effects, And they were one cause, One level of cause. And even in that, They were a partial cause. We cannot attribute everything to them, Philosophically speaking. Not that we are minimizing father and mother, But philosophically we are analyzing. Like say for instance, There is a child who was, Who was born blind. If you say father and mother, Are the cause of the child, We must blame that father and mother. Why did you give birth to a blind child? You couldn't do something properly, Child is nicely born. They'll say, What to do? It was not in our control. It was not in your control. That's exactly we are saying. They are partial cause, They are not the ultimate cause. So, Absolute truth, Is the ultimate cause, Of everything, Including us. So just like we have to be devoted, To our partial cause, Father and mother, We should also be, Absolutely devoted, To our absolute cause,

**Key Quote:** "As spiritualists, we do not trust our mind."
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes the importance of controlling the mind and not surrendering to its dictations, highlighting the need for introspection and understanding the forces within the body.

Prabhupada explains that a spiritualist has to be very sober, introspective, thoughtful, grave: vacho vegam, manasa, krodha vegam, jihva vegam, udhara upastha vegam. It means a kind of a force in the body. Prabhupada gives the example, just like our body is designed in such a way, when there is a nature's call, it creates a force, irresistible force. We all have to rush to the washroom. In the same way, there are other forces in this body, and one of them is the force of the mind. As spiritualists, we must know these workings of the mind, workings of the forces in this body, so that we know how to deal with them. Shukadev Goswami is giving one such example. He is saying, "This mind, which is unsteady and which comes with a force, don't trust this mind." This is the first instruction. So, Prabhupada explains, as spiritualists, we do not trust our mind, meaning we do not surrender to the dictations of our mind. The mind comes with a force. Mind comes with an idea: "Let's do this. Let's do that. You do this. You do that." And it comes with a certain force. Don't trust your mind. This is the instruction. Watch the mind's action. So, in other words, this is the instruction. In other words, intelligence is higher than the mind. Soul is higher than the intelligence.

**Key Quote:** "We first become devotees of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the paradox of becoming proud of pridelessness and emphasizes that genuine spiritual qualities arise from devotion to Krishna rather than mental attempts to acquire them.

Some time back, one devotee asked me, what if a devotee becomes proud of pridelessness? Yes, it happens. It can happen. We can become proud of many other virtues that a devotee is supposed to have. But, our method of developing all these qualities is not by trying to acquire those qualities separately. We first become devotees of Krishna. To become genuine devotees of Krishna, we have to come to a spiritual platform. Our principle is, in such a person's heart, all divine qualities will come about. If we make an attempt to become prideless on a mental plane, there is a chance that we will become proud of pridelessness. But our attempt is to come to a spiritual platform. And when one comes to a genuine, spiritual platform,

**Summary:** Prabhupada insists on the name 'Krishna Consciousness' over 'God Consciousness,' explaining that the society will make Krishna known worldwide and that the term was inspired by Rupa Goswami.

Maybe you should call it International Society for God Consciousness because nobody knows Krishna in America. So Swamiji says no God Consciousness is a very vague term and this should be known as Krishna Consciousness and this society will make Krishna known all over the world. If people don't know who is Krishna the society will make Krishna known all over the world. That was the kind of reasoning that Prabhupada had that God Consciousness is a very vague word and he used the word Krishna Consciousness and in fact, the word Krishna Consciousness was also coined by Shrila Prabhupada, which later on he would say that he drew that on the basis of one expression that Rupa Goswami had used in one of his works. Krishna Bhakti Rasa Bhavita Matihi. Matihi means consciousness consciousness. Bhavita means imbued with and consciousness, which is imbued with Krishna Bhakti Rasa. So that's how Prabhupada had coined that word Krishna Consciousness and he wanted this to be a society of Krishna Consciousness for devotees to come together, who are practicing and as per the vision of his spiritual instruction of the spiritual master and as per the prophecy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. This has to be an international society. And that's how the name International Society for Krishna Consciousness came up.

#### devotional service, impediments, Vaishnava Aparadha, Krishna consciousness
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/i5ImCRHRxU8?t=126

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna consciousness is perfect and eternal, and therefore it cannot be lost under any circumstances."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the impediments to devotional service, including Vaishnava Aparadha and the Lord's desire, emphasizing that a devotee advanced in Krishna consciousness cannot be lost.

who has once absorbed his mind in the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead may sometimes be influenced by impediments, but he still does not give up his exalted devotional position. According to Srila Vishwanath Chakravarthy Thakura, there are two kinds of impediments to devotional service. The first is an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaishnava. This is called Vaishnava Aparadha. Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu warned His devotees not to commit Vaishnava Aparadha, which He described as the mad elephant offense. When a mad elephant enters a beautiful garden, it destroys everything, leaving a barren field. Similarly, the power of Vaishnava Aparadha is so great that even an advanced devotee becomes almost devoid of his spiritual assets if he commits it. Since Krishna consciousness is eternal, it cannot be destroyed altogether, but advancement may be checked for the time being. Thus, Vaishnava Aparadha is one kind of impediment to devotional service. Sometimes, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee desires to impede one's devotional service. For example, Hiranyakashyapu and Hiranyakshya were formerly Jaya and Vijaya, the gatekeepers in Vaikuntha, but by the desire of the Lord, they became His enemies for three lives. Thus, the desire of the Lord is another kind of impediment. But in both cases, the pure devotee once advanced in Krishna consciousness cannot be lost. Following the orders of his superiors, Swayambhuva and Lord Brahma, Priyavrata accepted family life, but this did not mean he lost his position in devotional service. Krishna consciousness is perfect and eternal, and therefore it cannot be lost under any circumstances. Because the material world is full of obstructions to advancement in Krishna consciousness, there may appear to be many impediments, yet Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, declares in Bhagavad Gita, 9.31 Once one has taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost. In this verse, the word Shivatamam is very significant. Shivatamam means the most auspicious. The devotional path is so auspicious that a devotee cannot be lost under any circumstances. This is described in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita by the Lord Himself. Parthnaivehanamutra Vinashastasya Vidyavrata My dear Arjuna, for a devotee, there is no question of being lost, either in this life or in the next. In Bhagavad Gita, 6.43, the Lord clearly explains how this is so. Tatratam buddhi samyogam labhate pavarvadehikam yadate chatato bhuyaha samsiddho kuru nandana By the order of the Lord, a perfect devotee sometimes comes to this material world like an ordinary human being. Because of his previous practice, such a perfect devotee naturally becomes a devotee. He becomes attached to devotional service, apparently without cause. Despite all kinds of impediments due to surrounding circumstances, he automatically perseveres in devotional service and gradually advances until he once again becomes perfect. Below Mangal Thakura had been an advanced devotee in his previous life, but in his next life he became greatly fallen and was attached to a prostitute. Suddenly, however, his entire behavior was changed by the words of the very prostitute, who had so much attracted him, and he became a great devotee. In the lives of exalted devotees, there are many such instances, proving that once one has taken to the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, he cannot be lost. Kaunteya pratijanihi namey bhaktav pranashyati The fact is, however, that one becomes a devotee when he is completely freed from all reactions to sinful life. As Krishna states in Bhagavad Gita, 7.28, Esham tuantagatam paapam jananam punyakam te dvandhva moha nirmukta bhajan teman dhrdha vrataah Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of illusion, engage themselves in my service with determination. On the other hand, as Prahlad Maharaj said, Matirna krishne paratas svatova mito bhipadyeta grihavrataana A person who is too attached to materialistic things, family life, home, family, wife, children and so on, cannot develop Krishna consciousness. These apparent contradictions are resolved in the life of a devotee by the grace of the Supreme Lord and therefore a devotee is never bereft of his position on the path of liberation which is described in this verse as Shiva tamam padavim Dasan dhristavak chidantaprabhat So in this chapter of the Srimad Bhagavatam entitled The Activities of Maharaj Priyavrata we just saw Parikshit Maharaj asking different questions about Priyavrata's life how he was a great devotee renounced from all material activities but then he took up he became a grihasta, became a householder had two wives had many children and apparently became attached to family members and he was a ruler, he was a king dealing with all the complications of a king's life how did this happen? because if somebody is attached to family life and such materialistic things he cannot develop Krishna consciousness and if one has become advanced in Krishna consciousness he will not become attached to material things so this looks like Priyavrata's life seems to be a contradiction so that was the question that Parikshit Maharaj has raised and this entire chapter is going to resolve this apparent contradiction and today's verse Shukadev Goswami has begun he is saying bhaada muktam yes what you have said this is what you have said is correct muktam what you have said Parikshit just now bhaadham it is true and then Shukadev Goswami is further elaborating bhagavata utthama shlokasya srimaccharanaravindamakarandharasaaveshita chetasah bhagavata paramahamsadaitakatham it is all describing the position of a devotee bhagavata utthama shlokasya the lord bhagavata bhagavan the lord utthama shlokasya who is glorified by transcendental and eloquent prayers srimaccharanaravinda his lotus feet makharandha the honey or the sweet nectar rasa that is the sweet nectar rasa aveshita chetasaha once whose heart is aveshita absorbed by in the in remembering the lotus feet of the lord which is makharandha rasa bhagavata utparamahamsa and such devotees who are paramahamsas they are liberated daita katham and the lord's activities katham descriptions are daita very very pleasing to them so they are attached to the lotus feet of the lord they are absorbed in hearing the glorification hearing the glories of the lord such devotees kinchit sometimes what happens to them antaraya vihatam sometimes they may be checked by some impediments antaraya vihatam they may be checked by antaraya impediments some obstacles however swam shivatamam padaveem but that padaveem that position shivatamam padaveem that most auspicious position they have attained their own position swam shivatamam padaveem naprayena naprayena hinvanti nahinvanti they never lose that position they never give up that position prayena more or less in that sense almost naprayena hinvanti

**Summary:** This segment explains the meaning of 'Shivatamam' as most auspicious and how devotional service is the most auspicious position, which is never lost even with impediments.

shishukadeva goswami said what you have said is correct badhamuktam the glories of the supreme personality of godhead who is praised in eloquent transcendental verses bhagavata uttama shlokasya srimad charanaravinda by such eloquent transcendental verses by such exalted personalities as brahma are very pleasing to great devotees daitha and liberated persons paramahamsa great devotees and liberated persons is very pleasing one who is attached to the nectarian honey makarandarasa of the lord's lotus feet shrimad charanaravinda and whose mind chetasa is always absorbed aveshita in his glories katham may sometimes kinchit be checked by some impediments vihatam antaraya vihatam but he still never gives up na hinvanti the exalted position he has acquired shivatamam padavim na hinvanti auratam na hinvanti this is the message of shukadev Goswami shukadev Goswami and Shila Prabhupad has explained some very interesting things so here the expression used Prabhupada has pointed out in the purport shivatamam padavim shivatamam शिवा means auspicious and शिवतमाम means just like गुह्यम, गुह्यतारा, गुह्यतमाम, it is superlative. In the same way, शिवतमाम means most auspicious. So, the living entity may come across, may have some things which are auspicious. Living entities may come across something more auspicious. And living entities may come across something most auspicious. And devotional service to Krishna. This position, आवेशित, मकरंदरस, आवेशित, चेतसहा, is the most auspicious. This is the most auspicious position of a devotee. And that position is never lost, even if a devotee has to encounter certain impediments.

**Summary:** This segment discusses two kinds of impediments: Vaishnava Aparadha and the Lord's desire, using the example of Jaya and Vijaya to illustrate how the Lord may impede devotional service for extraordinary reasons.

And then Prabhupada has quoted in the purport, Vishwana Chakravarti Thakur's explanation, Yes, this अन्तराय विहताम, there can be two kinds of impediments. One impediment, the first impediment is वैश्णवा पराथ. If someone commits वैश्णवा पराथ, that's an impediment. But, प्रभुपाद has clarified, even if it is an impediment, one may lose his devotional service, but one will not lose it completely, because devotional service is eternal. consciousness is eternal it cannot be destroyed all together but Advancement may be checked for the time being till the devotee corrects him his Vaishnav Aparath sets it right it may be checked so Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's warning is that one has to be very careful about Vaishnav Aparath so that's one kind of impediment then there is another kind of impediment the other kind is Lord or his devotees own wishes sometimes however the Supreme Personality of Godhead or his devotee desires to impede one's devotional service for some very extraordinary reasons devotee Lord himself wants to impede Lord's devotee wants to impede that must be under some very extraordinary circumstance what was the example Prabhupada has quoted Jaya and Vijaya they were the gatekeepers of Vaikuntha they were serving the Lord personally they had great personal Association of the Lord but then they were sent to take birth three lives and become asuras so that is another interesting pastime of the Lord and why did that happen Why did Lord decide impede their devotional service Lord had it why did the Lord desire like that and Jaya and Vijaya go there and the whole arrangement happened the four kumaras came and they were not

**Key Quote:** "The absolute truth is a personality. And what is the meaning of personality? Personality means somebody who has got desires."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the Lord is a personality with desires for enjoyment, which are variegated and multi-dimensional, and that He sometimes arranges for devotees to take on different roles to provide Him with different kinds of pleasure.

Actually, a conscious person, a very primary characteristic of a conscious person, personality is having desires for enjoyment. That's why ultimately Kama Deva means Krishna. Because Kama, desire to enjoy, ultimately belongs to the Lord. He is the ultimate Kama Deva. So He is the Supreme Personality, means He has desires to enjoy. And enjoyment is not one-sided, it is variegated, it is multi-dimensional. And so, Lord, sometimes everyone is praising me. Okay, let me, somebody should also fight with me. That's another nice thing. So the Lord may decide, okay, my dear two devotees, I will impede your devotional service here. You can do another kind of devotional service by going there and taking birth as Asuras. And I will come and fight. And you should be strong. Don't worry. It is a tough fight. Otherwise, what is the use? I come and fight and then suddenly you surrender. It doesn't please me. So I want you to become powerful demons. Shake the whole universe. Then I will come. Then we will have fight. You see how this is? This is actually, Bhagavatam is establishing the personality. The absolute truth is a personality. And what is the meaning of personality? Personality means somebody who has got desires. And he pursues those desires for enjoyment. And the pursuit of the desire for enjoyment constitutes activities. That is actually the Lord and His associates. That's actually the truth.

**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of a prisoner's perspective to explain how our understanding of the spiritual world is limited by our material existence, emphasizing that the spiritual world is the greater and dominant reality.

What happens is, our view of the world and the creation, it is just like the prisoner's view in a prison in our world. The prisoner is in the prison. He is used to things in the prison. Big walls. He is conditioned. He cannot escape. He cannot relate with the family members. It's all restricted. He wants to enjoy. It's all restricted. So this is actually the perspective of a prisoner. In the same way, our perspective is actually we see from the material world. Actually the truth is, we all know, we all are outside the prison in this world. So we know that how the world is full of irrigatedness. So many activities. There are parks. There are malls. There are restaurants. So many ways to enjoy. By the way, there is one small portion in our city, in every city, called the prison. In the same way, the reality is, the greater reality is, the Lord and His associates and the wonderful pastimes that happen in the spiritual domain. By the way, there is one part of the creation called the material world where all the rebellious living entities are put there. So, this is actually the reality. But, because we are in the material world, we are trying to understand the spiritual reality from the material domain. It's just like the prisoners looking at, oh, there is something called a free world, is it? Oh, there is some park. There are parks there. There are all such beautiful things. Okay, maybe there. So, that's the view of an inmate of a prison. Actually, that's the way we look at when we hear about the spiritual world. But, the greater reality and the dominant reality is the spiritual world.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "One will not lose his devotional position if one is under the order of superiors one is acting in this way."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how the Lord's desires and the orders of superiors can lead devotees to take on different roles, using the examples of Jaya and Vijaya and Priyavrata, emphasizing that following the orders of superiors ensures one does not lose their spiritual position.

The material world is a small portion. So, so this is the, so these are the reasons why certain times the Lord wants, Lord is a personality and He has got desires and He wants to pursue those desires for His pleasure and His own devotees take up different roles to give Him different varieties of pleasure and that is another example. So, this is an example Prabhupada has quoted of Jaya and Vijaya where their devotional service was in one sense impeded but actually not in another sense. It was meant for a larger, another kind of a pleasure of the Lord. So, sometimes we may see this kind of an impediment. Another one is Priyavrata himself. Priyavrata was not, his impediment came not from the Lord but from his devotee. Swayambhuva Manu and Brahma, both great personalities, great devotees, they went and told Priyavrata who was in his, like it is described here, Makaranda Rasa, Aveshita Cheta Saha, he was absorbed in transcendental mellows of the Lord but they went and told him, no, no, now you come, become a king, become a householder, have queens, have children, all of that. So, he may do that but Priyavrata when he is doing that, he never lost his shivatamam padaveena prayena hinvanti. They never lose their spiritual position. That is to be appreciated and understood because Krishna consciousness is perfect and it is eternal and it cannot be lost under any circumstance. So here, important point is following the orders of his superiors Swayambhuva Manu and Lord Brahma, Priyavrata accepted family life but this did not mean he lost his position in devotional service. This is the point that this chapter is going to point out. Bhakti is such that if one is in different kinds of roles, if one is in different kinds of situations, but those roles and situations are under the order of the superiors, then one will not lose his devotional position. This is the crux of the matter. shivatamam padaveena prayena hinvanti One will not lose his devotional position if one is under the order of superiors one is acting in this way.

And this principle and many other principles of the Bhagavatam they were actually demonstrated in the life of Srila Prabhupada. I heard somewhere one devotee describing actually Prabhupada's life is so exemplary. It's not unlikely Vyasadeva will include Prabhupada's life in some part of the Bhagavatam which he composes in some other part of the universe. Because lives of devotees demonstrate spiritual principles and Prabhupada's life is a great demonstration of one of the important principles which is to follow the orders of the superior. Prabhupada's life was fully a manifestation of the following the order of his spiritual master.

**Summary:** This segment shares excerpts from Srila Prabhupada's lectures and letters, emphasizing that his motivation for traveling and spreading Krishna consciousness was solely to fulfill the order of his spiritual master, not for personal gain or recognition.

There was once a lecture Prabhupada gave somewhere in Canada. I'll read some portions of that. Prabhupada is speaking in Montreal 1969. In this old age I have come to your country. Why? Because we are trying to follow the footprints of Lord Chaitanya. Therefore we have come. Otherwise in old age who goes out of home? You see like we sometimes hear about our some spiritual gurus and Swami's spiritual God men in our country. They go open centers around the world and they have temples they have followers. Why do they go? Mostly it is that you know I want to expand my footprint by just India. I have a global footprint. Because you know these are all ideas from the from the world of business. And where they want to expand businesses around the world such ideas are there. Or maybe there are rich disciples there I can get rich disciples and so I can become very prosperous. Whereas when Srila Prabhupada was going what was his motivation? What was the what was actually driving him? It was not some kind of some kind of a global footprint and rich disciple. None of those things. Because my spiritual master ordered I have come I have gone to different parts of the world. In another letter Prabhupada wrote I have come to your country to carry out the wishes of my spiritual master and you are kindly cooperating with me.

**Summary:** This segment continues to illustrate Srila Prabhupada's humility through his letters, where he emphasizes that he is merely abiding by the order of his spiritual master and that all credit goes to him.

So Prabhupada was going to different places and we have Krishna Consciousness our attempts to expand Krishna Consciousness to different parts of the world it is because it was the wish of our predecessor Acharyas. In another letter that Prabhupada wrote to Brahmananda very very interesting letter. We can see the humility of Srila Prabhupada. Personally I am non entity. Prabhupada is saying I am nothing. Personally I am non entity. I have come here on the order of my spiritual master and he has kindly sent you all boys to assist me. So whatever is being done there is no credit for me. But all the credit goes to my spiritual master because he has arranged everything and I am simply to abide by his order. Just see this the mood of Srila Prabhupada. I am simply to abide by his order.

A devotee is not independent. What we do how we do what we like to do all those things we set aside we do what our superiors wanted us to do.

hence for those of us who are here in the material world like in the prison we are cut off from the prisoners are cut off from the free world in the same way we are cut off from the spiritual world we cannot get there in our present situation in our present consciousness we don't know about that spiritual world sometimes an important officer of the government comes to the prison and then he tells them what is the world outside like why are you all suffering here he brings information about the free world such a person is very special isn't it and he tells them if you do these things you can come there you don't have to be suffering like this here you come there there is real enjoyment there is real relationships are there relationships are not excluded in the material world relationships are temporary and it will not always give us happiness in the spiritual world there is a world of relationships between the devotees and the Lord and various other devotees once Prabhupada was asked what will happen to all of us when we go Prabhupada said in the spiritual world there will be another is gone and all of us will associate there so we will be with Prabhupada so this is the reality that Prabhupada was sharing see how when we are in the material world we don't know what it is and so an Acharya comes and his words have to be regarded very very specially and Prabhupada's own life is a demonstration of how he regarded his spiritual master's words so seriously another expression Prabhupada used we should take the words of the spiritual master as one's life and soul and Prabhupada's life is actually a demonstration of these things

in fact Prabhupada recalls another in connection with Bilwa Mangal Thakur I will read this small paragraph this was a class Prabhupada gave in Gorakhpur in 1971 my Guru Maharaj used to say like that finish this business in this life don't delay for the next life you see this kind of an intensity the kind of a seriousness that Srila Bhaktisiddhant Saraswati Thakur brought in his instructions carried down by Srila Prabhupada actually this is the mood of the Bhagavatam this is the mood of the Vedic literatures don't take it in a in a cool relaxed manner okay if I if possible let me make some spiritual advantage if it doesn't happen it's okay life is you know no Thivrena Bhakti Yogena a certain kind of a Thivra Thivra means intense it is expected the Bhagavatam's teachings are to bring that Thivra so that's why Bhaktisiddhant Saraswati Thakur is saying finish this business this business means Prabhupada explained in an earlier part of this lecture this business of lording over material nature like we are all interested to do lord over material nature and enjoy different things material pleasures finish this business lording business in this life don't delay for the next life he was telling also don't give me trouble again to come to deliver you don't give me trouble to don't give me trouble again to come here to deliver you that is the responsibility of the spiritual master spiritual master's responsibility is to take the disciple to Krishna until he is able to to help him to help him to help him that is the verdict of the Shastras just like Bilwa Mangal Thakur his spiritual master delivered him taking the shape of a prostitute just see so this is the position of the spiritual master it is his responsibility to take and see the way Prabhupada is saying until he is able to to help him to help him to help him and to help him if he has become so fallen hunting prostitutes come as a prostitute and help him these are very very transcendental dynamics that happens how the lord his and his devotees make arrangements to uplift a living entity take him back to the spiritual world so these are some very extraordinary things

Contradictory. How can the festival which is joyous be a punishment? How can punishment which is miserable be a festival? So we will see all of that in a short while. Also, this festival conveys a very profound spiritual message. Krishna says, नाहं प्रकाश सर्वस्या योगमाय समावृतः, "I am not revealed to everyone. There is a curtain of Yogamaya that is covering me." So Krishna, who is the supreme personality of God, who is the Param Sathya, who is the Param Tattva, and in this material world, all the living entities are in a spirit of independence from the Lord, don't want to surrender to the Lord, want to lead a life independent of the Lord. To them, the Lord is not revealed easily.

So the living entities who are here in the material world, who have turned away from Krishna, how will they ever be rectified from their illusory, imagined position of being independent of the Lord? So Lord has one immediate expansion tattva called prakasha tattva. The Lord's prakasha tattva's function is to prakasha, to make, to illuminate, to reveal the truth to the living entities, to the living entities who are in ignorance. We are in such an ignorance, just like the sunshine thinking, "I will be independent of the sun," most ridiculous, most impossible. That is our situation. To such ignorant living entities, to bring prakasha, to illuminate them, there is an expansion of the Lord, and that expansion of the Lord is Balaram. So Krishna is the original person, and Balaram is his immediate expansion, and he is prakasha tattva. Krishna is para tattva or bhagavat tattva, non-different. Krishna and Balaram, Krishna and Balaram, both are on the same spiritual absolute position, but Balaram is the one who reveals Krishna, and one who reveals to the living entities about all this is guru, and that guru is actually a representation of Balaram prakasha tattva. This is the understanding. The guru is someone who reveals Krishna. Guru is someone who gives Krishna to the forgetful living entities. So when Krishna came as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Balaram, the prakasha tattva of the Lord, came as

He was longing to be with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to serve his mission, be in his association.

Chaitanya Charitamruta says he mixed bananas and honey to all of this and served Nithyananda Prabhu and all the associates on the banks of Ganga. And at that time, Nithyananda Prabhu made a statement, "We belong to the cowherd clan, and coming on a picnic like this on the bank of a river and having delicious food to eat is something that we love." Actually, this statement is significant because Nithyananda Prabhu is Balarama, and Krishna and Balarama and the cowherd boys would go on the banks of Yamuna and they would have their picnic everyday. All the things that their mothers had brought, had sent with them, they would share, called Vanabhoj. So that's what Nithyananda Prabhu was reminiscing. And at that time, Nithyananda Prabhu by his meditation brought Chaitanya Mahaprabhu there, and only a few fortunate souls, it is said, could see Chaitanya and Nithyananda, and there was ecstatic uproarious kirtan with Chaitanya and Nithyananda and chanting of the holy names which filled the air, and this Chiradahi which was given to Nithyananda and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was served to everyone. So this was a festival, and then towards the end of the festival, mystically Chaitanya Mahaprabhu vanished from the scene and only Nithyananda Prabhu and other associates were there.

**Key Quote:** "So, being a devotee in a transcendental relationship and not being envious of Krishna, these are the qualifications one must have in order to access the confidential knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita."
**Summary:** HG Chanchalapathi Dasa explains that devotion and lack of envy towards Krishna are essential qualifications for understanding the confidential knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita, based on Krishna's statements to Arjuna.

In the fourth chapter, Krishna says, "Bhaktosime Sakacheti Rahasyam Hetaduttamam Arjuna, this is a confidential knowledge, but you can understand because you are my devotee and friend." So, devotion to Krishna in a transcendental relationship, like a friendship relationship, is an important qualification to access that confidential knowledge. Later on, in the ninth chapter, Krishna says, "Idam Tute Guhyatamam Pravakshyamyana Suyave." There also he says, this is very confidential knowledge, but Arjuna, you can understand because you are not envious of me. So, being a devotee in a transcendental relationship and not being envious of Krishna, these are the qualifications one must have.

**Key Quote:** "Because he is absolute, both his anger and pleasure are the same."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while both Arjuna and Krishna are described as angry, Krishna's anger is transcendental and not subject to material nature.

Both Arjuna and Lord Shri Krishna are described here in an angry mood. But Arjuna's eyes were like balls of red copper, whereas the eyes of the Lord were like lotuses. This means that the angry mood of Arjuna and that of the Lord are not on the same level. The Lord is Transcendence. Please note, Transcendence with a capital T. And thus he is absolute in any stage. His anger is not like the anger of a conditioned living being within the modes of qualitative material nature. Because he is absolute, both his anger and pleasure are the same. His anger is not exhibited in the three modes of material nature. It is only a sign of his bent of mind towards the cause of his devotee. Because that is his transcendental nature. Therefore, even if he is angry, the object of anger is blessed. He is unchanged in all circumstances.

#### Ashwatthama, Arjuna's anger, Krishna's anger, Srila Prabhupada's purport

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada is taking this as an opportunity to explain that Arjuna's anger was that his eyes were red. Krishna is also angry that his eyes are like lotus."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the context of Ashwatthama's capture and how Srila Prabhupada uses the situation to explain the difference between Arjuna's and Krishna's anger.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport. It's a very interesting part of the Bhagavatam. Ashwatthama has been captured by Arjuna. He is Rajva Bhadva. He is being tightly bound by the ropes. Ripum, he is his enemy. Shibiraya Nishantam. And it is Arjuna's intent that he should bring him to the Shibira military camp. Praha, at that time, spoke. Krishna spoke. Praha, Arjuna. And to Arjuna, Prakupitaha. Praha, who is angry. Bhagavan, Ambujekshanaha, Lord, who has lotus eyes, spoke. Praha, because in the next verse we see Lord Krishna speaking. So Bhagavan, Ambujekshanaha, Krishna, who has lotus eyes, spoke. Prakupitaha, to angry Arjuna. And in the purport, Srila Prabhupada has expanded the understanding and he has said that not only Arjuna was angry, even Krishna was angry about the whole thing. If you see the next statement of Krishna, which you will see in your next class, he is telling Arjuna, kill him. Obviously, you can't be telling Krishna to kill him in a very happy way. Kill him. So there is anger even in Krishna's voice. So even Krishna is angry. Arjuna is also angry. Kill him. So that's the kind of... It's not a simple, normal conversation that's going on. So it's full of anger. And so, in the purport, we see how Srila Prabhupada is taking action. Srila Prabhupada is taking this as an opportunity to explain that Arjuna's anger was that his eyes were red. Krishna is also angry that his eyes are like lotus.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's position, Krishna's personality, Krishna's form, Krishna's nature, Krishna's name, Krishna's activities, all of these are transcendental."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the transcendental nature of Krishna, contrasting it with the material world composed of Panchabhootas (five elements) and influenced by Kala (time).

That is the difference. Srila Prabhupada takes every opportunity to explain the position of Krishna as a transcendental person. Krishna's position, Krishna's personality, Krishna's form, Krishna's nature, Krishna's name, Krishna's activities, all of these are transcendental. Transcendental meaning, it is something not of this material domain. In the material domain we are familiar with Panchabhootas, right, earth, water, fire, all our bodies, table, all of this is actually transformation of the Panchabhootas. And the Panchabhootas are always undergoing transformation, that is the nature of the Panchabhootas, and they are undergoing transformation under the influence of Kala. So in this material world we see material nature constituting of the Panchabhootas under the influence of Kala undergoing transformations. But Krishna's position is not within the Panchabhootas, not within the Kala, something that is beyond all of this. He is beyond. Whether it is the Rig Veda, whether it is the Upanishad, whether it is the Bhagavad Gita, all of them constantly repeat this

**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's transcendental position using references from the Bhagavad Gita, particularly focusing on how Krishna establishes this in the fourth chapter by stating he spoke yoga to Vivasvan long ago.

point. Krishna's position is Tamasaha Parastaat. Tamasaha refers to the material world, the Panchabhootas under the time. Tamasa also refers to ignorance, also refers to darkness. This nature of the material world is dark, and so Parastaat is beyond. Let's see how this material world is beyond. Let's see how Krishna establishes this, that his nature is very different and he is transcendental in the Bhagavad Gita. They say, there are many places, but in a very early part in the fourth chapter of the Gita, Krishna begins to establish this. Let's see how Krishna does this in a very interesting manner. In the fourth chapter, Krishna begins by saying, imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam. This knowledge, yoga knowledge, yogam, imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam. This avyaya yogam, this immutable, indestructible knowledge of yoga. imam vivasvate yogam proktavan prokta means I spoke. proktavan aham avyayam yogam aham proktan to whom? imam vivasvate yogam unto vivasvan. vivasvate yogam proktavan aham proktavan. avyaya yogam aham proktavan imam vivasvate unto vivasvaan. This imam avyayam yogam. Because in the second chapter of the Gita, Krishna spoke. He concluded about transcendental knowledge. Sorry in the third chapter. Krishna concluded that about thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material senses, mind and intelligence, one should control the lower self by the higher self and thus by spiritual strength conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.

That's how the third chapter ends. And then this, how this evam buddhe param buddhva, by this transcendental knowledge, transcendental intelligence, how you should conquer. So this knowledge concerning transcendence, yoga, this I spoke long ago to Vivasvan. This is how Krishna is beginning the fourth chapter. And when he hears this, when Arjuna hears this, he gets a doubt. And in the fourth verse, Arjuna, as I'm skipping a few verses, keeping focus on a certain point that we are discussing. Arjuna uvaca aparambhavato janma param janma vivasvataha katametad vijaniyam tvam adahoproktavaniti Arjuna is asking, Krishna, you are saying that you spoke this knowledge to Vivasvan. How could you do that? aparambhavato janma param janma vivasvataha You are born, you are very junior.

How can I understand? Just like, suppose I say, we are all here going to celebrate book distribution success, right? So, suppose I tell you this story. Three weeks back, I went to Delhi and I was aware there is some problem. There was a book marathon going on. And even I thought I should distribute some books to some important people. So I went to Delhi. I took with me a carton of books. And there was another devotee with me. We went to Red Fort in Delhi. And there was a big lawn beside the Red Fort. We went to the lawn in the Red Fort. And this devotee was with me with a carton of Bhagavad Gitas. And there I saw, there was a gathering and there was some security men and went through all of that. And there, you know, Delhi means security. All these are big issues. So, went there. And had an opportunity to meet Jawaharlal Nehru. And I told the devotee, I said, you know what? And I told the devotee, bring the books. And he opened the carton. And I presented the book to Jawaharlal Nehru. And next to him was Mahatma Gandhi. And I presented, get another book. And he gave me another. I presented another book to Mahatma Gandhi. He looked through the book. And next to him was Dr. Radhakrishnan. Then I remembered, oh, Prabhupada has criticized Radhakrishnan. He didn't understand Gita. So let me give him. I took another book. Dr. Radhakrishnan, this is Bhagavad Gita. You must read. You will understand better. And they were all very happy. And then I said, thank you very much for receiving. And then me and the devotee with me, we were happy. We gave the books to the first prime minister of the country. And we came back. And I come this and come back to Bangalore. And I tell you all of that. This is what we did. Then you will ask the question. Prabhu, how could you give Bhagavad Gita to Jawaharlal Nehru, your junior? Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhiji, they are very senior. How could you give? This is the question that Arjuna is asking. Just see. Aparambhavato janma param janmavivasvatah. How can I understand? You spoke this knowledge to Vivasvan. Vivasvan is param. He is much much senior to you. Katametadvijaniam tvamadau proktavaniti. You spoke. How can I understand? You distributed Gita to Jawaharlal Nehru.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's answer to Arjuna, emphasizing the difference between them: Krishna remembers his past lives and is unborn and inexhaustible, while Arjuna does not.

And now let's see what Krishna says for this. Only one question, Arjuna. Next verse is Sri Bhagavad Gita. Krishna is answering. bahunime vyatithani janmani tava ca arjuna tanyaham vedasarvani natvam vedtaparanthapa bahunime vyatithani janmani Many, many births, I have taken. Arjuna. bahunime vyatithani janmani many many birds I have passed, you have also passed Arjuna, not that only I have taken many birds and I have appeared many times, even you have taken many birds, TANI AHAM VEDA SARVANI, I am aware of all of those different appearances of mine, NATVAM VETA PARANTHAPA, THVAM NAVETA, you don't understand, you don't remember them, you are not able to remember all of that PARANTHAPA, so immediately Krishna is making a clear point, pointing out there is a difference between you and me just see very clear BAHUNI ME VYATI TANI JANMANI TAVACHARJUNA, TANI AHAM VEDA SARVANI, NATVAM VETA PARANTHAPA and let's see the next verse what Krishna says AJO PISAN NAVYAYATMA BHUTHANAM ISHVARO PISAN PRAKRITIM SWAM ADHISHTAYA SAMBHAVAM YATMAMAYAYA this is my position AJA I am unborn ABYAYATMA I am inexhaustible BHUTHANAM ISHVARO PISAN all existence, all living entities, I am the controller my position is different, Arjuna PRAKRITIM SWAM ADHISHTAYA this is my position situated in my position PRAKRITIM SWAM ADHISHTAYA SWAM PRAKRITI my own nature this is my nature nature, transcendental nature, situated in my adhishthaya, svam prakritim adhishthaya, adhishthaya means being fixed, being situated, prakritim svam adhishthaya sambhavami, I appear in this world, so my appearance, my taking birth here in this world is not the same as you taking birth, it is different, I am Aja, Avyaya, Bhutanam, Ishwaraha, and sprakritim

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Krishna's appearance in the world, using the analogy of a king visiting a prison to distribute sweets, and connects it to Krishna's purpose of protecting devotees, annihilating demons, and establishing dharma.

svam adhishthaya sambhavami, so Krishna is establishing that his position is transcendental, this is a very important point because Krishna is talking about, he is speaking to Vivaswami, he is coming to this world, to help us understand Srila Prabhupada gave an example, a simple example, one day there was a king and it was king's birthday, and the king decided, oh today is my birthday, how shall I celebrate, anyway so many parties and all those kind of things, all that happens, but this time the king decided, let me go to this world, to the prison and distribute some sweets, in the prison, prisoners suffering, so the king came to the prison to distribute sweets on his birthday, and the prisoners were watching, oh Maharaja has come, so the prisoners were discussing among themselves, see Maharaja has come to our prison, that means he has also become a prisoner, so Maharaja has come, now the king may come to the prison, but he maintains his royalty, his position as the king, prakriti svam adhishthaya sambhavami, situated in his transcendental position, he comes to this world, atmam ayaya, after saying this let us see what Krishna says, now you will immediately recognize, this is the famous verse of the Gita, yad kriyay, ya yadayadahi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata abhyuttanam udadharmasya tadatmanam srjamyaham After that, paritranaya sadhunam vinasayacha duskrutam dharmasam sthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge yuge So this is the context in which Krishna is telling how he appears yuga after yuga in order to protect the devotees, to annihilate the demons and to establish dharma. He is telling about his appearance in this world. And he is telling that how prakritim svamadhisthaya sambhavami atmamayaya So that we understand how he appears. Soon after that, let's see the next verse what Krishna says. janma karma chame divyam evam yo vethi tattvatah Just see. My birth, my activities are divyam. This is the position of Krishna. Krishna's position is transcendental. He is not a person of material world. His position is transcendental. His personality is transcendental. His nature is transcendental. His name, form, activities are all transcendental. janma karma chame divyam evam yo vethi tattvatah And if someone learns this, Krishna's nature, Krishna's appearance, Krishna's activities, all of these are transcendental.

We were meeting him in the evening, and he came, and he said, he had, in the morning, he had attended an address by Narendra Modi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and he said, Narendra Modi came to the gathering, and we could see he was full of anxiety. Narendra Modi said, Oh, now I understand, I don't want to worry about this. What happened? There was a kind of anxious appearance. And then he started speaking, and of course, after he started speaking, you know, he is a good speaker, he is a good orator, newspaper, so many kinds of difficulties, right? Very depressing, somebody is shouting India should happen this, that should happen, JNU campus and police attacking this, that. And you read the newspapers, it's very depressing. So many difficulties and our leaders in our country, they must be going through a lot of anxiety. Imagine Prime Minister's situation, so much anxiety and now in a few weeks few few days he has to release the budget for the country. So much tension. So if you look at the material world situation, whether it's in our country or whether it is in our world, you look at the world situation. Terrorists, Bombing and Taliban and this problem, that problem, refugees running away, all kinds of problems, international, national, and look at our own lives.

But this knowledge has an ability to help us come out of all of these problems. How does this work? I'll give you an example. This is an example that Srila Prabhupada also gives. Like say for instance, I am sleeping and in my sleep I am having a dream. And in the dream, I'll just take few minutes, extra minutes and wind up. And in the dream, I go with my friends to Banerjata, picnic, Banerjata we know, famous place. And while I am in the, I am having nice time, suddenly a leopard begins to chase all of us. Right? Familiar story. And we all start running. And we look behind, the leopard is running and we are all running. And here are my friends, here they are all, someone jumps up a tree and climbs. Oh my God, he made it to the tree and I am still running, looking behind. And somebody else goes away this side, that side. And finally I see the leopard has singled out on me. Oh God. And it's chasing me and I am running, running, running, oh full of anxiety and I look behind, all my friends, they are all feeling great relief that leopard has left them and I am seeing them, they are all just feeling it, you know, what, what they relieved, but I am still running and how anxious I will be. And then I am running and running in the midst of the forest. I see one building. Oh, great relief. I run towards the building and the leopard is behind me chasing and I, there is a door there, I push the door open and I jump, run in, get into the building, into that room and then I shut the door, latch it. Oh. And there is a window, I look out of the window, I look outside, the leopard is just there. Oh. Oh. I am so relieved and I look around and inside the room, there are ten more leopards. Oh. And these ten leopards are just getting up from their sleep and they are all, one dozen pairs of leopards staring at me. What an anxiety. What an anxiety it is, right? What shall I do? Again, I am slowly going towards the door, but I am remembering there is a leopard outside. What an anxiety I will be going through. How can someone help me? There is one way, one wonderful way to help me. Wake up. And I wake up and I say, oh. Oh. There is no leopard. There is no one dozen leopards, there is no one leopard, nothing. It was all a dream. How relieved I will be.

**Key Quote:** "Material existence is actually a dream... Each one of us being his part and parcel are also transcendental."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that material existence is like a dream, and that we are all transcendental beings belonging to Krishna's world, but are currently absorbed in material energy.

So, material existence is actually a dream. What Krishna teaches in the Bhagavad Gita, in the Bhagavatam is that, not only is Krishna transcendental, each one of us being his part and parcel are also transcendental. We don't belong to this material domain at all. We belong to another world. Our coming into this world, taking this body made of Panchabhutas, our existence in this Panchabhuta existence of this material domain under Panchabhuta and Kala is itself a dream-like existence. And in the dream we will be having, we'll come across a lot of situation. This material domain is designed in such a way it constantly creates one anxiety after another anxiety. And that's what we are all going through individually, collectively, nationally, internationally. Just like you see how very good leaders in our country, in our world, brilliant people constantly applying their minds, constantly applying their intelligence, solving one problem after another problem, another problem, but still another new problem comes up. Just like you see how it is. Now this is our position. We are transcendental. We belong to Krishna. We belong to Krishna's world. But we are right now completely absorbed in the material energy, in the material domain. And it is said in the Vedic literatures When the living entity Jeeva is absorbed in this Panchabhuta, Kala existence, Swatha Yin yang by ourselves we cannot figure out what they really are because we can't actually come up with the exact meaning they really are. What is happening? We will go on solving one problem. By then another problem comes. Yet another problem will come. Like this we will be suffering. Maya Mugdha Ji. Nahi Swatha Krishna Gyan. Who is Krishna? Who we are? This knowledge we will not understand by ourselves.

#### renunciation, Krishna consciousness, anger, liberation, sense control

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Becoming liberated does not necessitate losing one's sensual activities; sense activities continue even in the liberated stage."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's purport, focusing on the role of a sanyasi, Krishna as the best friend, the nature of anger in liberated souls, and the continuation of sense activities in Krishna consciousness.

Purport by Srila Prabhupada According to the Vedic system, a sanyasi, a person in the renounced order of life, is dressed in saffron-colored garments. This saffron dress is practically a passport for the mendicant and sanyasi to go anywhere. The sanyasi's duty is to enlighten people in Krishna consciousness. Those in the renounced order of life have no other business but preaching the glories and supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, the Vedic sociological conception is that a sanyasi should not be restricted. He is allowed to go anywhere and everywhere he wants, and he is not refused any gift he might demand from a householder. The four Kumaras came to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. The word Suhrtama, best of all friends, is important. As Lord Krishna states in the Bhagavad Gita, He is the best friend of all living entities. suhrtam sarva-bhuta-anam No one can be a greater well-wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is so kindly disposed towards everyone that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord, He comes Himself. Sometimes personally, as Lord Krishna appeared on this earth, and sometimes as His devotee, as did Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and sometimes He sends His bona fide devotees to reclaim all the fallen souls. Therefore, He is the greatest well-wishing friend of everyone. And the Kumaras wanted to see Him. The doorkeepers should have known that the four sages had no other business, and therefore to restrict them from entering the palace was not apt. In this verse, it is figuratively stated that the younger brother of desire suddenly appeared in person when the sages were forbidden to see their most beloved personality of Godhead. The younger brother of desire is anger. If one's desire is not fulfilled, the younger brother anger follows. Here we can mark that even great saintly persons like the Kumaras were also angry, but they were not angry for their personal interests. They were angry because they were forbidden to enter the palace to see the personality of Godhead. Therefore, the theory that in the perfectional stage one should not have anger is not supported in this verse. Anger will continue even in the liberated stage. These four mendicant brothers, the Kumaras, were considered liberated persons, but still they were angry because they were restricted in their service to the Lord. The difference between the anger of an ordinary person and that of a liberated person is that an ordinary person becomes angry because his sense desires are not being fulfilled. Whereas a liberated person like the Kumaras becomes angry when restricted in the discharge of duties for serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the previous verse, it has been clearly mentioned that the Kumaras were liberated persons. Vidit Atma Tatva means one who understands the truth of self-realization. One who does not understand the truth of self-realization is called ignorant. But one who understands the self, the super-self, their inter-relation and activities in self-realization is called Vidit Atma Tatva. Although the Kumaras were already liberated persons, they nevertheless became angry. This point is very important. Becoming liberated does not necessitate losing one's sensual activities. Sense activities continue even in the liberated stage. The difference is however that sense activities in liberation are accepted only in connection with Krishna Consciousness. Whereas sense activities in the conditioned stage are enacted for personal sense gratification.

**Key Quote:** "They were eager to see their beloved master Lord Hari, and that was stopped by the two doorkeepers, and hence they became very disturbed."
**Summary:** The speaker breaks down the verse, explaining the context of the Kumaras' attempt to enter Vaikuntha, their qualifications, and the reason for their anger: being prevented from seeing Lord Hari.

So this verse is talking about So we have been reading about the sages trying to enter Vaikuntha and the two doorkeepers stopping them from entering the Vaikuntha Loka. These sages were, it is described here, Suarhatama. They were very, very qualified. They were not some unqualified persons trying to enter Vaikuntha. They were Suarhatama. And still, Nishidhyamanaha, they were forbidden. And when they were forbidden, Animesheshu Mishatsvu, there were many other personalities of the Vaikuntha. Animesha, Animesha refers to unblinking eye. It refers to Vishnu and it refers to Vishnu's associates. So Animesheshu Mishatsvu, they were all other residents of Vaikuntha. They were also watching over this. Nishidhyamana Suhratamahyapi Hare Pratiharapabhyam, Hari's Pratiharapabhyam, His doorkeepers, His associates, Pratiharapabhyam, they stopped them. So the sages began to speak, Uchuhu. From the next verse onwards, Munaya Uchuhu, sages will be speaking. So why were they and how did they speak? They were with angry words they spoke. Kamanujena sahasata upapluthakshaha, upapluthakshaha, their eyes became very agitated. And with what? With the Kama Anujena. Anuja means a younger brother. Kama Anujena refers to a younger brother of desire, Kama. And so Prabhupada has said that figuratively it means the anger. Kamanujena sahasa, suddenly they became angry. And importantly why did they become angry? They were suarhatta maha, they were most qualified. And in the previous verse we saw viditaatma tatvam, they were self-realized. And why did they become angry? That is disclosed in this verse. Because suhrthama didrikshita bhanga, they were didrikshita, very eager to see. They were eager to see whom? suhrthama, their beloved master Lord Hari. And that was bhanga, that was stopped by the two doorkeepers. And hence they became very disturbed. When the Kumaras although by far the fittest persons suarhatta maha api were thus forbidden entrance nishidhyamanaha by the two chief doorkeepers of Sri Hari Hare pratihara pabhyam while other divinities looked on animisheshu mishatsu Their eyes suddenly turned red upaplu thakshaha because of anger kamanujena due to their great eagerness didrikshita to see their most beloved master suhrthama didrikshita bhanga Sri Hari the personality of Godhead.

**Key Quote:** "The sages are carriers of the message of the Lord; they have no interest other than to share the information about the Supreme Lord, the purpose of life, and what is that we should do in this human form of life."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on Prabhupada's points about the Vedic sociological conception, emphasizing the importance of saintly persons (sadhus) in society and their role in disseminating spiritual knowledge.

So Prabhupada has touched upon many important points. The first one is that the sages were not to be forbidden because it is so in the, it is the sanyasi or a mendicant or a sage is permitted to go to any place and no one shall stop them. That is the, what Prabhupada has said here. This is the Vedic sociological conception. How a Vedic society is organized, how the Vedic society conducts is what is being described. Why is it so? Why is it that the sages should be allowed to go anywhere and no one should stop them? Because the sages are carriers of the message of the Lord. They have no interest other than to share the information about the Supreme Lord, the purpose of life and what is that we should do in this human form of life. So they have, they are meant to enlighten the society and hence they should not be stopped. This is the, important position of the sadhus in the Vedic sociological conception. From this we see, the important position given to a saintly person in the Vedic society. He is discharging a very important duty of enlightening the people about the spiritual values of life.

**Content Type:** story
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Giving knowledge about self-realization is even far superior and more important than becoming a king and ruling over a kingdom."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of King Vena to illustrate the elevated position of brahmanas and the importance of spiritual knowledge over material power in Vedic society.

In another place, in the Bhagavatam, King Vena was a very impious king. And then, in the Vedic system, the king has to follow the directions of the brahmanas and rule and encourage and not only maintain the citizens in his kingdom, fulfilling their material needs, he also has an obligation to ensure that their spiritual needs are also fulfilled. But King Vena was not a good king. He was a sinful person and he didn't care for the brahmanas and he was not encouraging any spiritual activities in his kingdom. At that time, all the brahmanas in his kingdom come together and they discuss what is to be done. And they decide that they should kill King Vena. And they kill him. And then, it says, from Vena's body they created another person and made him the king. Now the question comes, if the brahmanas were so powerful that they could kill and dethrone a king, why couldn't they become the king themselves? After dethroning King Vena, because after all he was a bad king. And there Prabhupada explains, no, the brahmanas would not become the king because they had more important duties than becoming a king, which is, they were engaged in self-realization and they were engaged in teaching others in the society in the matter of self-realization. So you see from all of these kind of instructions, where Srila Prabhupada positions that activity of giving knowledge about self-realization is. It's even far superior and more important than becoming a king and ruling over a kingdom. So this is the kind of conception that Srila Prabhupada in all his teachings he brings about, about the role of a saintly person in the human society. And hence in the Vedic conception, such a saintly person should have free access to move around in the human society and give this knowledge to whoever was ready to receive this.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the reason for the Kumaras' anger, emphasizing their eagerness to see Krishna and the frustration of being prevented from doing so.

Then the important thing that we have been discussing in these verses is the sages becoming angry and the reason why they became angry is very nicely described in this verse. That is, suhrutthama didrikshita bhanga. Didrikshita means great eagerness, I want to see. So that was the drive for the sages. They were heading towards Vaikuntha to see their beloved Lord, suhrutthama didrikshita. They wanted to see their beloved Lord and bhanga and that was stopped. And hence they became kamanu jena sahasa.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the meaning of 'suhrutthama' (best friend) and introduces the question of why a benevolent God allows suffering.

Hence they became angry. Here Prabhupada has explained in the purport, suhrutthama. Suhrut means friend. Suhrutthama means the best friend. A superlative. Just like we have in Bhagavad Gita the words guhyam, guhyatama means the most confidential knowledge. In the same way here, suhrutthama, suhrut, suhruttara and suhrutthama. Suhrut means friend. Suhruttara means greater friend. Suhrutthama means most well-wishing friend. So the superlative is used. So Krishna is such a friend of all living entities.

**Key Quote:** "People suffer so much when there is a death in the family, rightfully someone very beloved to them."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts a personal experience of witnessing a family's grief after a death, prompting reflection on the nature of suffering and God's role in it.

Sometimes people ask this question. Especially when there are some miseries in this world, somebody is suffering. Why God is giving this suffering to me? Very recently I was in a, you may know that we had a program in Lucknow. So we were staying in a, in a devotees house. And so early in the morning at about 2.30 am I was suddenly woken up. What sounded like, you know sometimes in the night you hear the howling of dogs or something. It sounded like that. So woke up for a moment for a while. And then okay some dogs, stray dogs everywhere you know. And went back to sleep. And then again after a while at about 3.30 I was woken up. And then I realized what I had heard was not actually howling of dogs. It was wailing of people. And it was much louder at 3.30 am. I woke up and I tried to intently hear. I could make out there were at least two male grown up men's voice wailing. And many women wailing. And some children also wailing. Crying out. It was a very shocking thing. And you know it's all very cold in North India this time. So the windows were all shut. So I went to the window and tried to see. And then with great difficulty pushed the window open and I immediately as, as the cold wave hit, similarly there were loud wailing voices. Just hit me back. Just shut the door and I didn't know what to do. Something's wrong with the neighbors. And then I turned on the light and then I came out. And then the devotee of the house, the host where we were staying, he came down the steps and he said Prabhu, wait, wait some neighbor I'll just go see and come. And he wrapped himself with him. And then he walked out. And then and this wailing was continuing. And then after a while he came back and he said Prabhu, the neighbor somebody passed away. Some some old woman. And at 2.30 they rushed her to the hospital. And then at 3.30 they brought her back and they are dead. And she is dead. And there are her sons and daughters and grandchildren eight of them all of them are living there. And so then he went back and then by then I just got ready and we were chanting. So in the morning when I was chanting at that time it went on for about an hour. Loud wailing of men women children. So at that time when I was chanting you know when you come across this kind of a thing multiple thoughts come to your mind. At that time I was particularly thinking about how people suffer so much when there is a death in the family. Rightfully someone very beloved to them. And then I was also thinking about how people suffer when there is a death in the family. And it went on and on and on for nearly one hour. You know to be wailing like that so intense. And here we see Krishna is the best well-wishing friend of all living entities. And Krishna the Supreme Lord the Supreme Powerful Lord He has sanctioned such a misery to a family. Everyone is suffering. Why is this so? How do we understand why the Lord has sanctioned such intense suffering that people are crying so much? Why there is death like this? At that time I was

**Key Quote:** "Krishna devotes an entire chapter on the modes of material nature because they are very important for spiritual life."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of the three modes of material nature (sattva, rajas, tamas) from the Bhagavad Gita, explaining their influence on our consciousness and their importance in spiritual life.

reminded of one verse in the Bhagavad Gita. Very interesting verse. In the fourteenth chapter of the Gita Krishna is talking about the modes of material nature. Krishna devotes an entire chapter on the modes of material nature. Of course Krishna talks about modes of material nature very early even in the second chapter onwards. But there is an entire chapter devoted even in the eighteenth chapter Krishna is talking. But there is a there is a this fourteenth chapter is specially dedicated for the three modes of material nature because they are very important for spiritual life. Why it is important is very nicely described before I come to the verse connected with the wailing family members. Here Krishna says, sattvat sanjayate jnanam rajaso lobha evaca pramada mohav tamaso bhavato ajnanam evaca In summary Krishna describes in this verse what happens because of the influence of sattva, rajas and tamo gunas. sattvat sanjayate jnanam From sattva guna jnana comes about. So that is why for spiritual life sattva guna is very important. sattvat sanjayate jnanam rajaso lobha evaca By rajas greed comes about. sattvat sanjayate jnanam rajaso lobha evaca pramada mohav tamaso bhavato ajnanam evaca And because of tamasa three things Krishna is listing. One is pramada madness moha illusion ajnana bhavata ha and ignorance comes about. Just see because of tamo guna, because of tamasic influence. So this is the influence of the rajas, tamas, sattvam, rajas and tamas. And hence if we are under tamo guna we will be mad, we will be in illusion and we will be ignorant about the realities. So after describing all these effects of the three gunas, Krishna says something, as a last verse in this discussion. And then Arjuna asks a question. And the last verse that Krishna is describing in this, not the last verse of the chapter, but in this series of verses describing the three gunas and their influence and what happens and all of that. guna netan atitya triyam deha deha samud bhavan janma mrtyu jhara dukhair vimukto amrutam ashnute

**Key Quote:** "One will be freed from the dukkha of janma mrutyu jara dukkhair vimukta and amrutam ashnute, and one can enjoy immortality."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how to transcend the three modes of material nature, leading to liberation from birth, death, old age, and disease, and the attainment of immortality.

And then Krishna is saying there is one state of existence. What is that? etan gunan etan triyam gunan atityah gunan etan atitya triyam There is a state of existence when we can transcend the three modes of material nature. atitya triyam gunan atitya Dehi deha samud bhavan Deha samud bhavan The three modes, the three gunas are associated with the body. Deha samud bhava They are produced in this body. It's connected with the body. It's not connected with the Dehi. Dehi is the soul. Dehi is the occupant in the Deha. So there is Deha and there is Dehi. And the Deha, Deha samud bhavaha Trigunan The three modes of material nature are associated with the body. Gross body and the subtle body. Whereas Dehi, the soul is not connected with this and he is, he can be situated in a atitya gunan atitya ha stage. Then what happens if we do that? If we come to that stage of being transcendental to the influence of the three modes immediately Krishna gives a wonderful benefit. What is that? janma mrutyu jara dukkhair vimukto amrutam ashnute One will be freed from the dukkha of janma mrutyu jara dukkhair vimukta and amrutam ashnute ashnute means to enjoy. And one can enjoy immortality. One can enjoy what is deathlessness. In other words one will come to a transcendental state. One will come to a spiritual state when one understands that I am not the body I am a spirit soul and when he is able to understand that he is a spirit soul and nothing can affect that spirit soul. No weapon can destroy. Nothing can touch that spirit. Material things can touch that spirit soul. So janma mrutyu jara all these are things connected with the body and he will be freed from the sufferings. janma mrutyu jara dukkhair vimukto amrutam ashnute So the Supreme Lord Krishna is very concerned about our suffering. He is the Supreme Friend. And he is naturally concerned about our suffering. And hence he has given us a process how we can become freed from that. And we close our eyes to all that become influenced by the rajoguna and tamoguna become greedy in the material world become involved in material activities because of the tamoguna become mad after material things be in illusion be in ignorance and then complain what is this so much suffering Krishna is giving us in this material world? This is not fair. So Krishna has given us a process of becoming enlightened. If we don't take up this process by nature we will be like that especially in Kali Yuga. Kali Yuga things are not at all congenial for spiritual life. So in Kali Yuga the circumstances are arranged in such a way that rajas and tamas influence is very strong. So we have to take up some methods some spiritual process by which we will come out of the influence of rajoguna and tamoguna and then we will strive to come out of these influences come to sattva guna and even beyond guna netana tityatrin dehi deha samudbhavan we can come to that state. And this is what Krishna is teaching.

**Key Quote:** "Human life is meant for something very serious, something very grave; something serious is happening around us, there is suffering in this world, and we must know what to do, how to solve this problem."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes superficial approaches to spirituality, emphasizing the seriousness of human life and the need for genuine spiritual wisdom to address suffering, especially in Kali Yuga.

And that is why Srila Prabhupada says so this is not some kind of a magic thing magical thing some ashes are given some other magic is given some gold is given these are all actually very silly things. Human life is meant for something very serious something very grave something serious is happening around us there is suffering in this world and we must know what to do how to solve this problem there is some there is a spiritual wisdom connected with this and how to get that spiritual wisdom our most well wishing friend Krishna has provided that information instead of taking all these things very seriously very frivolously we consider we pursue spiritual life somebody is giving some ashes somebody is solving some problem somebody is giving some gold and people run after all these this is simply because of ignorance not knowing what is spiritual life what is going on in this world and very unfortunately there are many many people like this in Kali Yuga who are misleading people

**Key Quote:** "No one can be a greater well-wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead; he is so kindly disposed towards everyone that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord, he comes himself."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Krishna's unparalleled kindness and willingness to reclaim fallen souls, even when they have forgotten Him.

so Krishna being the well wishing friend Prabhupada has made a very nice point just like sometimes it happens in our human interaction if someone doesn't recognize us or respect us we will become very upset and turn away from that person next time he is coming this way you turn away that side look at that man he didn't recognize me last time why I should even smile at him we become very upset like that in the same way in a sense we have turned away from Krishna we have forgotten Krishna Krishna Baheer Mukha and that's what Prabhupada is saying here no one can be a greater well wishing friend to any living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead he is so kindly disposed towards everyone that in spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord he comes himself sometimes personally we have forgotten him we have no interest in him and yet he comes personally Krishna comes personally as Lord Krishna appeared on this earth and sometimes as his devotee as did Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and sometimes he sends his bona fide devotees to reclaim all the fallen souls

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the unity of purpose between Krishna, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and the spiritual master in delivering spiritual knowledge and reclaiming fallen souls.

so sometimes Krishna comes himself in fact it is explained that Krishna came Prabhupada explains this Krishna came and he gave the spiritual knowledge he gave this there were many many occasions where Krishna gave this information but still people of Kali Yuga did not pick it up they did not understand so Krishna had to come once again next time as a devotee to demonstrate what is spiritual life and that happened as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu so Krishna coming or Krishna coming again as a devotee Chaitanya Mahaprabhu coming and then here something to be surprising very to be noticed in the same way it is of the same category Lord's descent Lord Chaitanya's descent a spiritual master appears in this world it's not a small thing because they have the same mission Krishna's mission Chaitanya's mission the spiritual master's mission is the same to reclaim the fallen souls to give that spiritual knowledge by which we can become janmam rutyu jhara dukhair vimukto amrutam ashnute how we can come to the platform of enjoying ashnute means to enjoy to relish that to relish that transcendental state free from immortality free from any worries about death disease old age all these things to give that wisdom the spiritual master appears so that is why the spiritual master appearance such a spiritual master who appears with this knowledge with this information with this purpose of giving this knowledge such a spiritual master

**Key Quote:** "The Guru is actually non-different from Krishna. Guru is Krishna Roopa. Krishna Roopa Hane. Shastrera Pramane."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes Chaitanya Charitamrita to explain that the spiritual master is non-different from Krishna and delivers devotees on Krishna's behalf.

is not to be considered lightly this very there is a very nice verse in Chaitanya Charitamrta which describes this position of the spiritual master it says I had mentioned this some time back also I noticed another very interesting feature in this verse guru krishna roop guru krishna roopahana shastrera pramane guru roope krishna krupa karena bhaktagane this is a this verse says shastrera pramane by the evidence of all the vedic literatures shastrera pramane guru krishna roopa has one word here krishnaroo is one word that is why in Sanskrit when we read Bra היא s books if you see a hyphenated word if you go to the original you will see it is a one word just for the sake of reading it it has been hyphenated but here it is a guru krishna roopa krishna roopa is one word one word it is a hyphenated word guru krishna roopahana Shastrera Pramane. The Guru is actually non-different from Krishna. Guru is Krishna Roopa. Krishna Roopa Hane. Guru Krishna Roopa Hane. Shastrera Pramane. And in the next line, Krishna Das Kaviraj Goswami is writing, Guru Roopa. Guru Roopa is one word now. Guru Roopa Krishna Krupakarena Bhaktagane. Krishna Krupakarena. Krishna will deliver Krupakarena Bhaktagane. He will deliver the devotees. Krishna will do that. But how? Guru Roopa. In the form of the spiritual master, Krishna delivers. It's Krishna who is delivering. But how does he deliver? Guru Roopa. So Guru Roopa is one word. Guru Roopa Krishna Krupakarena Bhaktagane. So that is why Prabhupada translates this as, from the evidence of all the Vedic literatures, the spiritual master, Krishna Krupakarena Bhaktagane. So that is why Prabhupada translates this as, from the evidence of all the Vedic literatures, the spiritual master is to be considered as good as Krishna himself. Guru Krishna Roopa Hane. In the form of the spiritual master, Krishna delivers his devotees. Guru Roopa Krishna Krupakarena Bhaktagane. So this is the position of the spiritual master, who comes to deliver. He is playing the same role.

**Key Quote:** "The best use of intelligence is to realize, recognize, and realize this intimate relationship we have with Krishna, because that realization is going to put an end to all our suffering."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of realizing our intimate relationship with Krishna, who is our greatest well-wishing friend, and how this realization can end all suffering, connecting back to the initial verse about the Kumaras' eagerness to see Krishna.

He is playing the same role, same purpose that Krishna descended, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu descended, and the spiritual master descends for the same purpose, to reclaim the fallen souls. And they are playing the, representing Krishna, who is Suhruddhama. He is the best friend. And in one class, Prabhupada mentions, that if there is a, if there is a very close friend, with somebody we have a very close intimate relationship, just like our father and mother, we all have intimate relationship, right, because we, they gave birth to us, they looked after us when we were small. And we naturally recognize father and mother. And if we don't recognize father and mother, they will say, what kind of a man you are? Right? You are supposed to have, you are supposed to recognize the role of father and mother, with whom we have an intimate relation. But actually we understand that relationship is on a bodily level. We understand that ultimately we are a spirit soul. Now in the same way, or in a real way, as spirit soul, we have an intimate relationship. As a spirit soul, we have an intimate relationship. We have an intimate relationship with Krishna. He is Suhruddhama. He is the best well-wishing friend. Now, the best use of intelligence is, to realize, recognize and realize this intimate relationship we have with Krishna. Because that realization is going to put an end to all our suffering. And hence, when we don't recognize Krishna and come to the point of Krishna realization, if we don't come, we have not used our intelligence wisely. So, this is the message of the Gita and the Bhagavatam, that our greatest well-wishing friend is Krishna, and we must realize our relationship, we must recognize this, and come to the point of realizing that relationship. Suhruddhama. And because these sages were rushing to see their Suhruddhama, and because they were stopped, they became very angry like this. We will stop here.

**Key Quote:** "People should learn Bhagavad Gita and accept the Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna as the Lord of everything, they should practice satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord instead of trying to satisfy their own senses."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the Srimad Bhagavatam verse and Srila Prabhupada's purport, discussing the causes of falling into the material world and the path back to Vaikuntha through Krishna consciousness.

Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 15, Text number 34. He is stated in Bhagavad Gita, 7th Chapter, Verse 27. It is stated that as long as a living entity is pure, he is in complete harmony with the desires of the Supreme Lord. But as soon as he becomes impure, he is in disharmony with the desires of the Lord. By contamination, he is forced to transfer to this material world, where the living entities have three enemies, namely, desire, anger, and lust. These three enemies force the living entities to continue material existence, and when one is free from them, he is eligible to enter the kingdom of God. One should not, therefore, be angry in the absence of an opportunity for sense gratification, and one should not be lusty to acquire more than necessary. In this verse, it is clearly stated that the two doormen should be sent into the material world, where criminals are allowed to reside. Since the basic principles of criminality are sense gratification, anger, and unnecessary lust, persons conducted by these three enemies of the living entity are never promoted to Vaikunthaloka. People should learn Bhagavad Gita and accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna as the Lord of everything. They should practice satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord instead of trying to satisfy their own senses. Training in Krishna consciousness will help one be promoted to Vaikuntha. Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport.

**Key Quote:** "Let them go to this material world, where paapi asaha, sinful people live with three enemies."
**Summary:** The four Kumaras' curse on the doormen is explained, focusing on the doormen's destination: the material world, a place of sin and the three enemies (desire, anger, and greed).

So we are seeing in this part of the Bhagavatam, the four Kumaras trying to enter Vaikuntha, and they have been stopped by the two doormen, and the sages have become angry, and now they are speaking their angry words. And we are seeing in this part of the Bhagavatam, in this particular verse, they sort of take an action, what should be done with these two doormen. Manthadhi means intelligence. Manthadhi means they are not acting very intelligently. Manthadhibhyam, these two. So let us consider, dhimahi, let us consider what should be done. Karatumprakrshtumiha, we should do something to them that will actually eventually benefit them. Karatumprakrshtumiha. And what do they decide? Lokan itho vrajatam. Let them itaha, from here, in this Vaikuntha. Lokan vrajatam, let them go, go away from here. Lokan itho vrajatam, because, antharabhava drishtya, they have developed a vision of antharabhava. They have, the Lord has one bhava, but they have developed an antharabhava. So, they have developed this kind of antharabhava drishtya. So they should not be here. Lokan itho vrajatam. They should go away from here. Where should they go? Paapi asas, place where paapi asa, paapis, sinful, wicked people, go. And where? Traya ime ripavo asya yatra. Ripaha, ripavaha, is enemies. Traya ime ripavaha, is enemies. Traya ime ripavaha, traya ripavaha, where people in this material world, let them go to this material world, where paapi asaha, sinful people live with three enemies. Ripavaha, traya ripavaha, let them live there, let them go to the place where living entities live with three enemies. Therefore let us consider, dhimahi, how these two contaminated persons, mandadhibhyam, should be punished. Kartum prakristam. The punishment should be apt. For thus, benefit can eventually be bestowed upon them. Prakrshtam ehah! Since they find duality in the existence in vaikunta life. Antharabhava drishtya. They are contaminated, mandadhibhyam, and should be removed from this place, vrajatam, to the material world, lokan, itho vrajatam, where living entities have three kinds of enemies,

**Key Quote:** "The reason why pure souls come into existential circumstances of the material world, which is the purport of the material world, is because of the purport of the material world."
**Summary:** This segment discusses why pure souls enter the material world, referring to it as the 'criminal department' of the Supreme Lord, as explained in Bhagavad Gita.

traya ime ripavo asya yatra ha. So Srila Prabhupada has mentioned some very significant things in the purport. This is an example of two perfected living entities in the spiritual world, the doorman. The doorman of Vaikuntham, lokan, itho vrajatam, living the spiritual world and coming to this material world. So Prabhupada has used this word in the purport. The reason why pure souls come into existential circumstances of the material world, which is the purport of the material world, is because of the purport of the material world. The purport of the material world, which is considered to be the criminal department of the Supreme Lord, is stated in Bhagavad Gita, chapter 7, verse 27. So how the living entities, pure souls, come into this material world, what causes that? Why they come into this material world? And that is what is happening here, and that is explained, Prabhupada is saying, that the purport of the material world is said in the purport of the material world. As the çünkü.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The living entities, bewildered, come into this material existence."
**Summary:** The lecture explores the fall of living entities from the spiritual world, citing Bhagavad Gita 7.27 and explaining the concepts of 'dvandva moha' (delusion of duality) and its connection to desire and envy.

So this verse, Prabhupada referred to this verse. Even during Srila Prabhupada's time, there would be discussions among devotees. So the living entities fall from the spiritual world. If they're in the spiritual world, the moral Ninevayas must be perfect. But, they fall to the material world. How does that happen? So that is explained in the seventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita. Ichcha dvesha samuthena dvandva mohena bharata. Sarva bhutani sammoham sargeyanti parantapa. Sarga means creation. Remember that verse in the Bhagavatam we read some time back. There are ten topics in the Bhagavatam: Sarga, visarga, creation, secondary creation, and so on. So Krishna is referring to the creation. Sargeyanti. Yanti means to come or to go, to go to the sarga, to go to the material creation. Yanti deva vratan devan. So yanti means to go. Sargeyanti parantapa. So this is actually referring to living entities going to the material creation. So living entities falling to the material world. So why does that happen? Sarva bhutani sammoham sargeyanti parantapa. The living entities, bewildered, come into this material existence. What is that bewilderment? Dvandva mohena bharata. Ichcha dvesha samuthena dvandva mohena bharata. Dvandva moha. Delusion of duality. That's what Krishna is saying here in the Gita. The same thing we are seeing here in the Bhagavatam. Antarbhava drishtya. Dvandva moha. Dvandva means duality. Having a desire and interest different from the Lord. That is called dvandva moha.

**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Having a desire and interest different from the Lord. That is called dvandva moha."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on 'dvandva moha' as having desires different from the Lord, using the analogy of parts of the body serving the whole and then suggests reading verses before and after for context, like looking up surrounding words in a dictionary.

Just like here, antarabhava drishtya. So as living entities, we are part and parcel of the Lord. It is natural that we must have an interest like the Lord. Our interest must be perfectly aligned with the interest of the Lord. But when we develop a different desire, a different understanding, a different mentality, antarabhava, then that is called dvandva moha. And then, because of that dvandva moha, itchha dvesha samuthena comes about. Prabhupada has explained very nicely what is this itchha dvesha. Itchha means desire. Here it is specifically referring to desire to become the supreme. In fact, if you see in this material world, everyone in every field tries to become the foremost. Businessmen try to become the richest. Students try to become the smartest. Famous people try to become the most famous. Powerful people try to become the most powerful. So they are actually, this is the desire. The living entity is driven by that desire. Itchha. And dvesha is envy of Krishna. When you hear that Krishna is the supreme, the thought, why should I accept Krishna is the supreme? Why Krishna is the supreme? Why can't I be the supreme? These two desires, itchha dvesha samuthena dvandva mohena bharata. Actually, a living entity is not expected to have this kind of a thinking. A living entity is part and parcel of the Lord. Just like every part of the body tries to serve the whole body. That is natural. And when the part develops a different attitude, it is called antarabhava drishtya. Dvandva moha. Sarvabhutha nisamoham sargeyanti paranthi. Actually, it's interesting to see in what context Krishna says this. It's good to, like I remember sometime long ago, someone had told, when you read a, when you see a word in a dictionary, like sometime, of course now you don't see a dictionary, all these days are gone. You google. When you see a word in a dictionary, some, you know, some old people's good advice, you see one word before that and one word after that and learn two words, so you learn three words. In the same way, when you read a verse in the Gita, it's good to see one verse before and one verse after, and you'll get to see the context, and it'll help us develop a certain interesting perspective.

**Key Quote:** "All living entities are born into delusion overcome by the dualities of desire and hate, this is the reason why they don't know me."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the verses surrounding Bhagavad Gita 7.27 to understand why Krishna says people don't know Him, attributing it to delusion, duality, desire, and hate.

So let's see why Krishna is saying this in the seventh chapter and we'll come back to the Bhagavatam verse soon after that. Krishna is saying, vedaham samatitani vartamanani caarjuna bhavishyani chabhutani mamtu vedana khaschana. Krishna is saying, I know, vedaham, aham vedah, I know samatitani, atitani sama, I know equally atitani, what is in the past, vartamanani, what is in the present, bhavishyani, what is in the future. I know the past, present, and the future. Chabhutani, and I know all the living entities. I know the past, I know the present, I know the future, I know all the living entities. Mamtu vedana khaschana, but me nobody knows. Mamtu vedana khaschana, khaschana mam na vedah, they don't know me actually. Krishna is developing this idea how people don't know me. Naham prakashasarvasya yogamaya samavrta hamudoyam na, anyway I won't go into those things. There is a very interesting line of thinking that Krishna is developing and then he has come to this point, mamtu vedana khaschana, me nobody knows. Why they don't know? Krishna is explaining in the next verse why is it that they have come to this state that they don't know me in the material world because, O son of Bharata, O conqueror of the four, all living entities are born into delusion overcome by the dualities of desire and hate. This is the reason why they don't know me because they are born into this material existence with this duality, delusion of duality and they have become, they have been overcome by this desire and hate, iccha dvesha samuttena. But what is this iccha? What is this dvesha? We need the help of the acharyas to understand that iccha refers to desiring to become the supreme ourselves. Dvesha means not willing to accept Krishna as the supreme, why can't I be the supreme? That envy, the desire and the envy and dvandva moha, duality, delusion of duality, a difference of understanding that we should not have actually.

**Summary:** The lecture shifts to Bhagavad Gita 7.28, explaining how to return to the spiritual world by ending sinful activities, performing virtuous deeds, and serving pure devotees.

In the next verse Krishna explains who is eligible to go back to the spiritual world. This first, this verse is talking about how the living entities came to this world, now how can they go back to the spiritual world that Krishna is saying in the next verse. Ye santmantagatam papam jananam punyakarmanam tedvandvamohamirmukthabha bhajanthemam dhrudabhrataham. Ye santmantagatam papam, those who have ended sinful activities, antagatam papam, jananam punyakarmanam, and performing pious and virtuous activities, tedvandvamohamimukthah. They have become freed from this duality, having a different idea. They worship me with firm determination. We will come to this verse a few minutes later. There are some interesting things. So, the sages are deciding that these two living entities, they have developed this, so they should leave this Vaikuntha and they should go to the material world. And what is that material world? Actually, the word Papi, we all generally understand, as one who has done Papa, right? Papi and Papa. So, actually, originally the meaning word, the word Papi means most wicked person, evil person, such a person. So, let them go to the place where such evil, wicked people go. People. And what do they do? They live with three enemies. Let them go to that world. See? That is why here, in this verse also, this contrast is there. Punya also, again, one understanding is pious. Papa means sinful. Actually, Punya means very elevated, very exalted, very exalted. Opposite of Papa, means very wicked, lowest. So, here, Punya-Karmana means activities in relation with Punya, virtuous. Acharyas describe that Punya-Karmana refers to serving a pure devotee.

If you read the purport also, Prabhupada is talking about that. It is stated in the Srimad Bhagavatam, that if one actually wants to be liberated, he must render service to the devotees. See, Punya-Karmana actually refers to serving devotees, because they are the most exalted people, and should have ended antagatam papam, that sinful desires, sinful activities, one should have ended. So, here, the sages are saying, they should go to Papiyasaha. Papiyasaha. Praya ime ripavo asya yatra. The three enemies, that is also Prabhupada has referred. That is also here in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna refers to in the 16th chapter, the three enemies of the living entity. Trividham narakasyedam dvaram nashanam atmanah. This is the chapter which we are all chanting now, 16th chapter. Dvaram nashanam atmanah. Kamah krodhas tatha lobhas tasmad etat trayam tyajet. So, Krishna is saying, Nara idam narakasyat dvaram. These three, Trividham narakasyat dvaram. Trividham narakasyedam dvaram nashanam atmanah. And this is one which, na atmanah nashanam. This can destroy. How soul can never be destroyed? What do we mean by that? Here, it is referring to degradation of the soul. Atmanashanam. It does not mean that soul will be destroyed, because soul can never be destroyed. It is already, na jayate namriyate. It is understood. Here, atmanashanam. That is why when we are reading the Vedic literatures, we should see it is to be, the meaning should be taken according to the context. So, Trividham narakasyetam dvaram nashanam atmanah. And what are the three things? The three doors to hell. Narakasya, kamah krodhah tatha lobha. Lust, anger, and greed.

**Key Quote:** "One should give up these three activities, kama, krodha and lobha."
**Summary:** The lecture discusses how lust, anger, and greed are glorified in modern society, making Kali Yuga a difficult age for practicing Krishna consciousness.

And Krishna's recommendation is tasmad. Therefore, see, Prabhupada says, whenever tasmad is used, it is like a conclusive statement. Krishna is making a conclusion after having analyzed something. These three are the gateways to hell and leads to the degradation of the soul. So, therefore, tasmad etat trayam tyajet. One should give up these three activities, kama, krodha, and lobha. And if you see in the material world, in our present civilization, these three qualities are highly glorified. Kama, lust. It is highly promoted. Kama, krodha. Okay, krodha to some extent it is very, even for good living, comfortable material living, is not very encouraging. So, it is not so much advised. Lobha, greed. There is no such thing. One can be, one could, material civilization, Kali Yuga civilization encourages one to rise to higher and higher and higher. Keep trying, keep struggling, working hard. So, these are the three which are considered to be ripavaha, enemies of the living entities. And, this is a world where paapiya sahatraya ime ripavo asya yatra. So, just see the, the things that are, how in the material world, how we look at things. And this is highly glorified. All the newspapers, media, everywhere, cinemas, everything, karma is encouraged. And, there is nothing wrong about it, people think. It is highly promoted. And, on the other hand, Krishna is saying, tasmadetatrayam tyajet. So, that is why, Kali Yuga is considered a very unfortunate age for those who are trying to practice Krishna consciousness,

**Key Quote:** "Material world is an abominable place."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the common perception of the material world as great with the perspective of enlightened sages, who see it as a terrible place where living entities are disturbed by the three enemies without even realizing it.

maybe we will find many, many kinds of hurdles. So, paapiya sahatraya ime ripavo asya yatra. And, we also see a certain perspective, the sages are showing. These two people, who have antarbhava drishtya, lokaan ito vrajatam. They should go away from here, and go to, paapiya sahatraya ime ripavo asya yatra. They should go to the material world. Actually, we here in the material world, we think, oh, our world is so great. Our country is so great. Our place is so great. Our, you know, so many nice things are there. But, the living entity, the great sages, in their estimation, material world is an abominable place. This is not a great place. That is why, Srila Prabhupada always quoted Bhaktisiddhant Saraswati Thakur saying, this is not a place, this is not a place for a gentleman. This is the perspective actually we must have. When we, this is an enlightened perspective. We should have a perspective of enlightened persons. The sages are enlightened persons. How they look at the material world, it's actually a terrible place. The living entities, they are caught up in this material world. And the three enemies are constantly disturbing them, and they don't even know that. Imagine you are thinking, he is your great friend and you are having always, you are always having him with you. You are always consulting him. But actually you don't know he is your enemy. How unfortunate. And he is always advising us and we are following that. Lust, anger, greed, these things are constantly influencing us, and we are accepting that influence and we are working in that direction.

**Summary:** The lecture concludes with Srila Prabhupada's recommendation to learn Bhagavad Gita, accept Krishna as the Supreme Lord, and practice Krishna consciousness, emphasizing the importance of pleasing a pure devotee.

Just see. And, finally, Srila Prabhupada concludes very nicely. People should learn, since the, that is why Prabhupada uses the word paapiya saha in the sense of a crime, criminality. In these last two purports, if you see, Prabhupada is using this, using the word criminal department. This material world is a criminal department in the sense of paapiya saha. Since the basic principles of criminality are sense gratification, anger, and unnecessary lust, persons conducted by these three enemies of the living entity are never promoted to Vaikunthaloka. People should learn Bhagavad Gita and accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna as the Lord of everything. So this is Prabhupada's recommendation here towards the end of the purport. People should learn Bhagavad Gita and accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna as the Lord of everything. They should practice satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord instead of trying to satisfy their own senses. And for doing this one, training in Krishna consciousness will help one be promoted to Vaikuntha. So there is a certain training that is required. Training in Krishna consciousness that will help one be promoted to Vaikuntha. And Srila Prabhupada has established an institution for training. And in this institution, in the process for this training to go back to Vaikuntha, a very important principle again and again explained in the Vedic literatures is that one should please a pure devotee.

**Key Quote:** "If you serve Tamal Krishna and Vishnu Jana nicely, I'll be very happy."
**Summary:** The speaker illustrates the principle of pleasing a pure devotee through the example of Prabhupada instructing devotees to serve Tamal Krishna Maharaj and Vishnujan Maharaj, highlighting the importance of serving leaders within the institution to fulfill Prabhupada's mission.

This is an inescapable principle. So how has Prabhupada instituted this in this institution where Prabhupada has said that this institution can train us to go back to Vaikuntha? One very interesting example where Prabhupada points out this principle. During Prabhupada's time there were several devotees. It was headed by Tamalkrishna Maharaj and Vishnujan Maharaj. These two sannyasis they were heading a group of Brahmacharis called it was called Radha Damodar Traveling Sankirtan Party. RDTSKP it was called those days. So it became a very successful Traveling Sankirtan Party. The two sannyasis both very good preachers leaders at that time those days and they were traveling in from one city to another city conducting programs in American universities and they recruited many many devotees hundreds of devotees they were recruiting and they had three big buses and they used to have Radha and Damodar Deities that's why it was called Radha Damodar Traveling Sankirtan Party. So one time these some of these devotees they were who were made devotees they were all they had joined the temples or joined the traveling party and Prabhupada had come to one place and then these devotees were all lined up about hundred of them American young boys clean shaved up and they were all given a rose flower and they lined up and they came and offered the rose flower to Prabhupada offered their obeisance and then and Prabhupada was very happy and then he all of them were sitting there and then Prabhupada addressed them young Bhaktas all young from the American universities so in that short address Prabhupada says if you serve Tamal Krishna and Vishnu Jana nicely I'll be very happy so this is an actually Prabhupada showing an important principle if you serve Tamal Krishna and Vishnu Jana nicely I'll be very happy so this is the system that Prabhupada created in the institution institution has certain leaders and if we work to serve them nicely this is exactly this is what the devotees some of them recalled and they said Prabhupada said if you serve Tamal and Vishnu Jana nicely I'll be very happy and that will please the spiritual master because this is an institution serving Prabhupada's mission and in an institution it is expected that there is somebody playing the role of a leader and everyone following the leader's direction and the vision and going ahead and doing different activities and if we do this as an institution it is serving Prabhupada's mission that will please him so it's actually a very important principle of course the leaders have a very big responsibility they have to represent Prabhupada they have to themselves be following Prabhupada's instructions properly and they should be constantly having that vision of serving Prabhupada's mission that's the responsibility of the leaders and if the devotees are serving them in fulfilling the mission of the institution that is pleasing pure devotees spiritual master Srila Prabhupada this is the institutional system that Prabhupada has set up and if we work in this institutional set up we will be trained training in Krishna consciousness will come about and will help one be promoted to Vaikuntha so even in very simple occasions like this Srila Prabhupada what he said is something very significant and this is an important principle that is actually working in the institution and if the leaders are playing their role properly and if the devotees are serving the leaders and following the systems and the services that have been assigned then this whole training process will be working and Srila Prabhupada will be pleased and Prabhupada will be blessing the devotees and we will be making progress to go back to the spiritual world

**Key Quote:** "Although by chance the doormen committed a mistake by checking the brāhmaṇas from entering the gate of Vaikuntha, they were at once aware of the gravity of the curse."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the verse and explains how the doormen of Vaikuntha reacted to being cursed by the Kumaras, understanding the gravity of offending devotees.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 15, Text No. 35: teṣām itīritaṁ bhāvava dhārya-gōraṁ tam brahma-dandam anivāraṇaṁ astra-pūgaiḥ sadyo hareranu ca rāvuru bhibhyatāstāt pāda-gṛhāva patatārāṁ tāmatikātare nāṁ teṣām itīritaṁ bhāvava dhārya-gōraṁ tam brahma-dandam anivāraṇaṁ Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupāda: "When the doormen of Vaikunthaloka, who were certainly devotees of the Lord, found that they were going to be cursed by the brāhmaṇas, they at once became veiled. They were very much afraid and fell down at the feet of the brāhmaṇas in great anxiety, for a brāhmaṇa's curse cannot be counteracted by any kind of weapon. Although by chance the doormen committed a mistake by checking the brāhmaṇas from entering the gate of Vaikuntha, they were at once aware of the gravity of the curse. There are many kinds of offences, but the greatest offence is to offend a devotee of the Lord. Because the doormen were also devotees of the Lord, they were able to understand their mistake and were terrified when the four kumaras were ready to curse them." Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport.

**Key Quote:** "So in other words, when they were told, go to the material world, that was considered to be a curse."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the doormen's fear of being sent to the material world, emphasizing that it was considered a curse by residents of Vaikuntha.

So we are seeing here, the four kumaras, who were checked by the two doormen of Vaikuntha from entering the Vaikuntha loka, and they were angry and they cursed the two doormen, and here we are seeing the response. We saw them cursing, or considering, in the previous verse, and in this verse we see their reaction of the two doormen. When they heard that they were cursed to go to the material world, they understood what a grave thing, mistake, they have done: avadharya ghoram. tad brahmadandam anivaranam astrapugaihi. And they also realised, they became fearful about brahmadandam, the curse of a brahmana, which is anivaranam, nivaranam, anivaranam, which cannot be counteracted. astrapugaihi. One may think that I am very powerful, I have so many weapons, you may have any kind of weapons, but by these weapons you cannot, anivaranam, you cannot counteract brahmadandam. So realising this, avadharya ghoram, brahmadandam, anivaranam, astrapugaihi, anivaranam, what did they do? sadyaha, immediately, harer anucarao, those devotees, who are followers of hari, uruvibhyatas, full of fear, tadpada grahao apatatam, they fell at the feet of the sages, holding to their feet, apatatam, fell down, atikatha rena, with great anxiety in their heart. So when the doorman of Vaikunthaloka, who was certainly devotees of the Lord, harer anucarao, found that they were going to be cursed by the brahmanas, brahmadandam, they at once became very much afraid, uruvibhyatas, and fell down, apatatam, at the feet of the brahmanas, pada grahao apatatam, in great anxiety, atikatha rena, for a brahmana's curse, brahmadandam, cannot be counteracted, anivaranam, by any kind of weapon, astrapugai. So, we can see here, and Prabhupada has mentioned, because they were themselves devotees, they understood how grave ghoram it was to have offended the sages, and the sages becoming upset with them, and cursing them. So they became, they were, they became aware, they understood, avadharya ghoram, they understood what a grave mistake they have committed, and they became fearful, urubhibhyataha, and they fell at the feet of the brahmanas, atikatha rena, with great anxiety. And, so, what was the curse that the brahmanas, the sages had pronounced on them, that we saw in the previous verse, loka nitho vrajatam, go to the material world. So that was the curse about which they became very fearful, they became very anxious. So in other words, when they were told, go to the material world, that was considered to be a curse.

**Key Quote:** "If you want to know the value of something, say some ornament... you have to go to a goldsmith... So in the same way, we have to get an estimation of anything, we have to go to a goldsmith."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a goldsmith valuing jewelry to illustrate the importance of understanding the material world from the perspective of enlightened individuals.

So now we should understand, we are all here in this material world, what people of the spiritual world, how they estimate this world. This is a world where people, when they are cursed, they go there. Right? But we think this is a very wonderful place, maybe some things are not alright, we will fix it. In course of time, we will fix it, and we will make it a very good place to live. In, in Indian government language, there is one expression, "punishment posting." If some IAS officer, bureaucrat, they don't cooperate with the politicians, or something, then the politicians will transfer them to Andaman, Nicobar Islands. And that's considered to be a punishment posting. So in the same way, this material world is considered to be a punishment posting for those living entities who are not willing to cooperate and be in harmony with the spiritual atmosphere. If we want to estimate, so in this way, we have to look at how this world is estimated by enlightened sages, or by residents of the spiritual world, how they rate this material world. We get a certain understanding from this verse. Just like if you want to know the value of something, say some ornament, sometimes we, some people drop some, some jewellery in the hundi, and then when we get that jewellery, and we want to make an estimate, how much it is, is it real gold, or some imitation jewellery, somebody dropped, now if you want to make an estimation of that, you have to go to a goldsmith, a goldsmith will check out, and then, because he is an expert in that, he will tell you it's worth how much money. So in the same way, we have to get an estimation of anything, we have to go to a goldsmith. If you go to a blacksmith, and take a piece of jewellery, you are not going to get very good understanding. So in the same way, we have to get an understanding of this, of this world, from those who are enlightened. That is the spirit, that is the perspective.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna is using the word, you must approach, tatvadarshinah, those who have, those who have seen the truth."
**Summary:** The speaker quotes the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize the importance of seeking knowledge from those who have realized the truth and are detached from sense gratification.

Because if people who don't, who are not enlightened, their views are not very important. That is why when Krishna says, tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya, upadekshanti te jnanam jnaninas tatvadarshinah, Krishna is using the word, you must approach tatvadarshinah, those who have, those who have seen the truth. In other words, those who are experiencing the truth, tatvadarshinah, no use going to an ordinary person if you want to get spiritual knowledge. In this context, Prabhupada also said, we should read books written by tatvadarshis, those who have actually seen the truth, very enlightened people. From their point of view, we should understand our life, our situation, our world, everything. Then we will be able to derive benefit from that. There is another verse in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna refers to the similar thing, that how, actually many times, but in this particular place, yasya sarve samarambha, kama sankalpa varjitaha, jnanagni dhadda karmanam, tamahuhu panditam buddhaha. In the chapter 4, text number 19, this is same as the, tamahuhu panditam buddhaha, these people are considered to be buddhaha, wise, by panditas. Sometimes somebody may consider them to be a wise man. Right? Like all our parents consider us to be very intelligent, my son is so intelligent. We may not be doing very well, but still our parents, out of love, they may say. So that's not important, we have to, whether we are wise, considered to be buddhaha, by panditas, tamahuhu panditam buddhaha. That is important. So Krishna is saying here, yasya sarve samarambha, kama sankalpa varjitaha, jnanagni dhadda karmanam, tamahuhu panditam buddhaha.

**Key Quote:** "In all endeavors, kama sankalpa varjitaha, they have given up the desire for enjoyment, kama, self-enjoyment, or sense gratification."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of 'kama sankalpa varjitaha' from the Bhagavad Gita, highlighting the importance of giving up desires for sense gratification to attain true knowledge.

In all endeavors, sarve samarambha, in all endeavors, kama sankalpa varjitaha, they have given up the desire for enjoyment, kama, self-enjoyment, or sense gratification. Because in every endeavor, a conditioned soul tries to enjoy. What is it that I can get for my sense gratification? Because that's the nature of the conditioned soul, when we come to spiritual life also, in spiritual life also we will be seeing how I can get some sense gratification. So that's the sad part. That is what we have to be watching out. So, yasya sarve samarambha, kama sankalpa varjitaha, so they have given up varjitaha, kama sankalpa, that determination or that desire for kama, varjitaha, jnanagni dhadda karmanam, such people who have become free from desire for sense gratification, in all their endeavors, such people have actually burned their fruitive reactions in the fire of knowledge. Which means, Prabhupada points out very nicely, kama sankalpa varjitaha is a result of being situated in jnana. So, if we are situated in transcendental knowledge, the effect of that is, in all our endeavors, we will not be looking for sense gratification. Conversely, if in all our endeavors we are looking for sense gratification, that is an indication we are not situated in jnana, we are still in ajnana. So, this is what great learned men consider. One is understood to be in full knowledge, whose every act is devoid of desire for sense gratification. He is said by sages to be a worker whose fruitive action is burnt up by the fire of perfect knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "This kind of a perspective, we must have an understanding, we must have an estimation of this material world. What is this material world about? From the perspective of enlightened people."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the need to view the material world from the perspective of enlightened individuals, using the analogy of animals praising each other to illustrate the importance of qualified praise.

This kind of a perspective, we must have an understanding, we must have an estimation of this material world. What is this material world about? From the perspective of enlightened people. And they consider this place to be a place, a most undesirable place, when compared to the spiritual world. If we don't have an estimation from enlightened perspective, we will be very mislead. Bhagavatam says, there is another verse in the Bhagavatam, shva-vid-varaha-ustra-karai samsthuta-purusha-pashuhu. Samsthutaha means to be praised by another person. samsthuta-purusha-pashuhu. In the material world, sometimes we come across one person praising another person. If one person is praising another person, who is that person who is praising? That is important. Otherwise, the example here given is shva-vid-varaha-ustra-karai shva-vid-varaha-ustra-karai, shva is dog, vid-varaha is a hog, pig, and ustra is a camel, karaha is a donkey. If these kind of animals, samsthutaha, they are glorifying, oh, he is such a great man. So these kind of animals will glorify another animal only. Because that is their perspective, after all. So, samsthutaha-purusha-pashuhu. Another person, they are glorifying, he is also like another, he is an animal only. So, the person who is praising must have requisite qualifications. So, if he is qualified, then his estimation, oh, he is praising somebody, he is praising something that has value.

**Summary:** The speaker describes the material world as a terrible place where living entities are in disharmony with their constitutional position and the Lord, emphasizing the lack of cooperation.

So, we see from the perspective that is presented here in the Bhagavatam about the material world, is that this is actually a terrible place. Constantly the living entities are absorbed in sense gratification. They are completely in harmony in disharmony with their constitutional position. They are completely in disharmony with the Lord. Although they are part and parcel of the Lord, they are not in harmony. Just like any part of our body, if it is not in harmony with the rest of the body, that part of the body, that organ of the body will become, is considered to be a diseased part. It will be a source of pain for us. So, all the parts of the body are meant to cooperate for the whole body. That's the constitution, that is the makeup, that is the way this body is constituted. If any part of the body is not in harmony with the whole body's well-being, then it will become a problem. So, just see what is our position in this material world. All the living entities who are not willing to cooperate with the Supreme Lord. And ours is a society full of people who are in this kind of a mentality. We are all, this material world is meant for people who are unwilling to cooperate. This is the understanding. And so when the two doormen heard that these sages are cursing us to go there. Oh! Uruvibhyataha! Became very, very fearful. Aniva... Avadharya ghoram! Oh! What a mistake! What a ghoram! What a big thing, mistake we have done. They started realizing that. So, this is how, this is the conception we must always maintain about this material world.

**Key Quote:** "Then we will not become attached. We will not become attached to any particular circumstance, particular situation. We can remain detached. And it will help us to be focused on Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that understanding the undesirable nature of the material world leads to detachment and focus on Krishna consciousness, quoting Srila Prabhupada's view of the modern world as a great calamity.

Then we will not become attached. We will not become attached to any particular circumstance, particular situation. We can remain detached. And it will help us to be focused on Krishna, Krishna Consciousness. Otherwise there is every chance that we will become very attached to this material world, not knowing actually this is not a very desirable place. Once in 1974, Srila Prabhupada wrote a letter. He had one disciple who had some law background and educated person. And then Prabhupada was encouraging him to... I mean he was also in a very senior position. At that time he was a GBC. And Prabhupada was saying, Prabhupada was encouraging him. Even in an earlier occasion, Prabhupada had encouraged him after he became a devotee, he should try to participate even in American politics. And... And Prabhupada had a wish that if devotees can become leaders in the society and if the society can be changed in that way, then it can be great. It is a great benefit. So in 1974, Prabhupada writes in a letter, "At the present moment, there is nothing but great calamity. But by injecting Krishna consciousness into the masses, we can change the situation greatly." So Prabhupada saw our material world, modern world situation to be, there is nothing but great calamity. In Kali Yuga, material world itself is a very fearful place. And in the material world, there are phases of time and Kali Yuga is considered the worst of all the phases of time, of all the Yugas. And we are here in this material world.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual learning is a very vast learning. And any learning requires qualification. If one does not have the qualification, you cannot learn higher things."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the gradual development of spiritual knowledge, highlighting the need for qualification and the compassionate role of Lord Buddha in addressing the misuse of Vedic principles.

Some time back, just about 2-3 weeks back, I went to a place, a Buddhist place. And then there was a Buddhist leader and there was a big gathering of Buddhist followers. And then the organizers told us there are 30,000 people here, all Buddhists and following and from all over the world they have come. Then suddenly dawned, I was just reflecting, 30,000 people from all over the world practicing Buddhism seriously. They have come and hearing some discourses and all that. And we understand from the from the parampara knowledge, it is Lord Himself who came as Buddha. Right? And He gave a certain knowledge. But actually that knowledge was, is not the highest knowledge. It was a knowledge that was essential for that particular circumstance. Because people had, were completely misled. And they were not following the real principles of the Vedas. They were completely misled. And so at that time, Buddha came and He had to teach a certain aspect. Because spiritual learning is a very vast learning. And any learning requires qualification. If one does not have the qualification, you cannot learn higher things. Just like if you want in our modern day, if you want to do law, you must be a graduate. And after you have done your graduation, then you can go for law. That's the system. Because you cannot appreciate. Legal things are all very complex. A young mind cannot understand that. One has to grow up a little bit and mature, and then can understand legal complications, why law exists, and all of those kind of things. So in the same way, spiritual knowledge also, there is gradation, and there are very advanced aspects of spiritual understanding. And if you have to understand higher and higher aspects of spiritual understanding, it requires higher qualifications. And the whole Vedic program is to gradually build that qualification in the human society, over many lifetimes, even if it takes many lifetimes. So not understanding all of these things, there was an occasion, there was a situation in our country, in our world, when people had misunderstood. And so at that time, Lord Buddha appeared. Nindasi Yajnavidera Shruti Jatam Shruti Jatam Yajnava Nindasi and he condemned, he rejected. Why? Sadaya Hrudaya Pashugatam Out of sadaya, daya, feeling great compassion for Pashugatam, for the killing of the animals. Animals were being killed, not understanding the real purpose, and why they were killing animals? And when they were questioned, they said Shruti Jatam Yajnava It is the Yajna according to the given in the Shruti, in the Vedic literatures. So they were citing their example. So Buddha said, Nindasi Yajnavidera Shruti Jatam. So it was a temporary arrangement. And then after Buddha, we understand came Shankaracharya. He set right several things. And then came many other Acharyas. So like that, the whole, there was a gradual, and progressive, development of the spiritual thought, spiritual understanding, and that reached its pinnacle, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came, Krishna himself came, and gave this knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "Srila Prabhupada has given that highest knowledge, in an easily understandable way, and we have come in touch with that."
**Summary:** The speaker traces the history of spiritual knowledge propagation through various Acharyas, emphasizing Srila Prabhupada's contribution in making the highest knowledge accessible and the importance of viewing life through the prism of transcendental knowledge.

But then, after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu left, one or two generations after that, two or three generations after that, again Chaitanya's knowledge, Chaitanya's understanding, what he had taught, was also misunderstood. And again there were Acharyas like Bhaktivinoda Thakur, who had to come and restore that. And then Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, continued the work, and then Srila Prabhupada. So if you see the whole, if you trace this history, last five thousand years, history of spiritual development, or spiritual knowledge propagation, in the last five thousand years of Kali Yuga, it has gone through ups and downs, and how it has been gradually elevated. And then, Srila Prabhupada has given that highest knowledge, in an easily understandable way, and we have come in touch with that. Being in the material world, a place which is actually meant for all those who are not law abiding, conditioned souls, a place where cursed people from the spiritual world are sent here. And for us, we have come in contact with this knowledge. And we are able to, and so, when, if we want to have an understanding of anything in this world, about our lives, what should be or how we should act in our life, we should see from the, through the prism of transcendental knowledge, given by Srila Prabhupada. Then we will understand things properly, in proper perspective. And, the proper understanding is that this is a great calamity, there is nothing but great calamity at this moment. But things can be greatly benefited, can be changed, by injecting Krishna consciousness. This was the understanding that Srila Prabhupada always had. This was the spirit of how to look at this material world.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Brahma gives in the Bhagavatam, a formula, which, we will never go wrong, with our words, we will never go wrong, with our mind, we will never go wrong, with our senses."
**Summary:** The speaker explains how to avoid mistakes in the material world by controlling our words, mind, and senses through constant devotion to the lotus feet of Hari, following the example of residents of the spiritual world.

And in the material world, we generally act through three things, according to Vedic understanding: by our words, we act. Right? By words we interact in this world, with our mind, and with our senses. And, sometimes, we have all experienced, sometimes we say something and things go wrong, in our relationship, or something happens. And we hurt somebody, and then after that we regret, oh my god, my words were not, I shouldn't have spoken like that. Or some emotions, or some thinking, through our mind also, we may sometimes make a mistake. But we act. And then, or through our senses, we act, knowledge acquiring and active senses. We act, and then we regret, oh I made a mistake, I shouldn't have done that. Right? These are the three ways by which we interact in this material world. And we can make mistakes in this. So, Lord Brahma gives in the Bhagavatam, a formula, which we will never go wrong with our words, we will never go wrong with our mind, we will never go wrong with our senses. And he says, if we follow this, we will be very safe. What is that? na bhārati meṅga mṛśopalakṣyate na bhārati meṅga mṛśopalakṣyate. Bhārati means untruth, or false, or a wrong path. Bhārati, Bhārati, generally refers to Mother Saraswati, right? But in studying Vedic literatures, we must see the context and understand. Here the word Bhārati means one's words. na bhārati meṅga mṛśopalakṣyate. Lord Brahma is saying this to Narada Muni, "My dear, my words never fail. My words never go wrong. My mind never goes into a... My senses will never go astray. How am I ensuring that?" That is by... Here the word used by the... In this verse... Because in my heart... Utkanta means similar sense as... With great anxiety... With great fervor... I am constantly holding on to the lotus feet of Hari. If we hold on to the lotus feet of Hari, with great eagerness, with great zeal... Prabhupada translates that word Utkanta. Utkanta is connected to the word Vaikunta. Vaikunta means free from anxiety. Utkanta means with full... Not exactly anxiety... With full zeal... With a great deal of fervor I am holding on constantly to the lotus feet of Hari in my heart. But because of that... So this is the formula that Lord Brahma is giving, that how we can ensure in our life our words, our mind and our senses don't go astray. And that is by holding on firmly to the lotus feet of Hari all the time. Holding on to the lotus feet of Hari means always living by Harer Anucharaha. In the spiritual world, the residents are all Harer Anucharaha. They're always Anucharaha. They're constantly following the directions of Hari. That is the position of the pure living entity in the spiritual world. So by doing that, even in this material world, which is great calamity around us, we can be very safe. This is the instruction of the Bhagavatam.

**Summary:** The Lord intervenes to prevent harm to his devotees, as stated in the Bhagavad Gita.

In Bhagavad Gita, the Lord declares that his devotees cannot be vanquished at any time. The Lord could understand that the quarrel between the doorman and the sages was taking a different turn. And therefore, he instantly came out of his place and went to the spot to stop further aggravation so that his devotees, the doorman, might not be vanquished for good. Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport.

**Key Quote:** "So, the Lord arrived there."
**Summary:** The lecture begins to explain the Srimad Bhagavatam verse about the doormen, the sages, and the Lord's arrival.

We are reading in the Srimad Bhagavatam, in this part, about the two doormen stopping the sages. And the sages becoming angry, and we just saw in the previous verses, they cursed that they should go down to the earthly planet. And we also saw that the two doormen very graciously accepted the curse that was delivered to them. And in today's verse, we are seeing how the Lord responded when he was aware that this was going on at the seventh gate of his Vaikuntha. evam tadhaiva bhagavan aravindha nabhah svanam vibhudhya sadatikramam arya hridyah tasmin yayo. He arrived there. evam in this way. Thus, tadhaiva bhagavan. At that moment, the Lord appeared there. And the Lord appeared there how? Sahashrihi, along with Lakshmi. So, this verse talks about the Lord at that moment arriving at the scene where the sages and the doormen and all of this cursing and humbly accepting and the sages being angry, all of this is going on. As Prabhupada mentions here, the Lord did not want further aggravation and something more should not happen to his devotees, the doormen. So, the Lord arrived there.

And so here, the svanam sadatikramam vibhudhya. Svanam, his own servants, sadatikramam, they had, atikramam, they had committed an offense. They had gone beyond what they should do. Atikramam towards whom? Sadatikramam towards the great sages, the four sages. Sadatikramam, svanam sadatikramam vibhudhya. The Lord became aware of that. And immediately, the Lord tasmin yaya. And how did he go there? Charanau chalayan yaya. With his own feet, he arrived there. Sahashrihi, along with Laxmidevi. Now, what is the Lord's lotus feet like? There is an interesting adjective here: Paramahamsa mahamuninam anmeshaniya charanau. Anmeshana means to search out or to seek after that lotus feet. So, the lotus feet which are sought after by whom? Mahamuninam, Paramahamsa mahamuninam. Paramahamsa means the most elevated transcendentalists. And mahamuninam, and very, very great sages, transcendentalists, great sages, they seek out that lotus feet. Anmeshaniya charanau chalayan sahashrihi. Walking on those lotus feet, which is sought after by the great transcendentalists and the great sages, the Lord arrived there.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord who is the delight of the righteous."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to explain the verse, focusing on the Lord's qualities as Aravindanabha and Arya Hridyaha.

And another expression that is used here is Arya Hridyaha. The Lord who is Arya Hridyaha, the Lord who is Aravindanabha, Bhagavan Aravindanabha, one who has a lotus in his navel, referring to the Garbhakshayi Vishnu, and from the lotus sprouts, from his navel sprouts the lotus on which Lord Brahma is situated and all the lokas are in the stem of the lotus, so he is known as Aravindanabha. And here he is also described as Arya Hridyaha. Arya, righteous, Prabhupada has used that word, Hridyaha, the delight of one who is attracted to. So, Arya Hridyaha, the Lord who is the delight of the righteous, who is Aravindanabha, and whose lotus feet are sought after by Paramahamsa Mahamuninam Anveshaniya Charanah Chalayan Sahashrihi along with Lakshmi Devi, he arrived there. At that very moment, Tadaiyava, the Lord who is called Padmanabha, Bhagavan Aravindanabha, because of the lotus grown from his navel, and who is the delight of the righteous, Arya Hridyaha, learnt about the insult, Vibhudhya, Sadatikramam, learnt about the insult offered by his own servants, Svanam, to the saints, accompanied by his spouse, the Goddess of Fortune, Sahashrihi. He went to the spot, Yayav, Tasmin Yayav, on those very feet, Charanah, sought after, sought for by the recluses and great sages. Paramahamsa Mahamuninam Anveshaniya Charanah Chalayan Sahashrihi. So, very beautiful verse.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Lord's concern for his devotees and contrasts the Vedic concept of a civilized person (Arya) with the modern materialistic view.

Describing how the Lord is so concerned about his devotees and what was happening in the Vaikuntha, and he personally arrived there immediately along with Lakshmi Devi. So, there are some very interesting points here from the verse. The Lord here is described as Arya Hridyaha, the delight of the righteous. This word Arya Prabhupada also describes in other places. Arya refers to a civilized person. Aryan refers to civilized. In the Bhagavad Gita when this word comes up in the second chapter, Prabhupada explains the word Arya is one who knows the progressive values of life. So, human life is meant for progressing in values in understanding, and one who is conscious of this, that human life we can achieve something which is very special which is not possible in other living entities. So, human life and human consciousness is very special and so we must attain that higher understanding. One who is conscious of this, they are called Aryans, one who is conscious of the progressive values of life.

**Key Quote:** "A person has to be judged by his tastes."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that true civilization is defined by refined consciousness and elevated tastes, not just external appearances.

Unlike in today's world, you see who is called a civilized man? A man who is wearing a nice suit and a tie and a boot and going in a big car and living in a big house, and these kind of things, he is considered to be a very civilized man. That is what is thought of. But actually in the Vedic culture, it is not just your attire. So, somebody may be in those kind of a very polished attire, but in his consciousness may have some other kind of a very lowly understanding. So, that is not important. What is important is Arya Hridyaha, and so the yardstick, the test that is used here, what Srila Prabhupada is setting forth is Arya Hridyaha, a person has to be judged by his tastes. What are his tastes? What is he attracted to? What is he, what delights him? You see. So, Arya Hridyaha means those who are very civilized, who know the progressive values of life, who have a refined consciousness, who have actually refined their consciousness, and how do we know they have refined their consciousness? Because their tastes have changed. That is the test. What is it that delights them? What is it that they are attracted to? What is it that they go after? So, that is an indication of the level of consciousness of the person.

**Key Quote:** "They are attracted to the transcendental Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that evolved individuals are attracted to the transcendental Lord, highlighting the Lord's position as the source of everything.

So, Arya refers not simply external dressing and those kind of things, but somebody who is evolved in his consciousness, and hence his likes, what engages him, what attracts him, those objects have changed and they are not some lowly material objects of this world, but the highest level of consciousness, they are attracted to the transcendental Lord. And so, the Lord is known as Arya Hridyaha. In that sense, Arya Hridyaha means those Lord who is the delight of the most civilized people. So, the Lord is the delight of the most civilized people, most enlightened people. That is why Krishna says itimatva bhajante maam budha bhavasamanvitah. They are enlightened, Buddha, and they are bhavasamanvitah, their heart is filled with bhava for the Lord because they are enlightened and they know who is the Lord, what is Krishna's position, He is the source of everything. So, this is the position of the Lord and there is another expression

**Key Quote:** "Shukadeva Goswami is charmed by Hari's transcendental qualities and his mathihi his consciousness is charmed by the transcendental qualities of Hari."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Shukadeva Goswami's attraction to the Lord's qualities with the superficiality of modern society, emphasizing the deeper understanding of an evolved person in Vedic culture.

in the Bhagavatam, a very interesting expression about Shukadeva Goswami, who is the speaker, great celebrated speaker of the Srimad Bhagavatam, and Bhagavatam when it is introducing Shukadeva Goswami, Bhagavatam says Shukadeva was harer gunaakshiptha mathihi. harer gunaakshiptha, akshiptha is a similar word like hridyaha, aarya hridyaha, akshiptha means charmed by, what is it that is, what is it that he is charmed by, and it is said that Shukadeva Goswami is charmed by harer guna, Hari's transcendental qualities and his mathihi, his consciousness is charmed by the transcendental qualities of Hari, so harer gunaakshiptha mathihi. So, we can see the contrast in modern society, we have people, they are just dressed up very well, but their consciousness, their tastes are actually very, very ordinary, they are attracted to women, they are attracted to some material sense gratification, they are full of greed and jealousy and all of those things, so those things are manifest, that is what is there in their heart, but externally they are dressed up very well and they appear like great civilized gentlemen. So, we can see the yardstick in the Vedic culture, such a much more deep understanding of a person who is an evolved person, and according to the evolution of the person, his tastes will differ, what he is attracted to will differ, you see in the 17th chapter

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "According to the level of development of consciousness we are attracted to different things."
**Summary:** The speaker references Bhagavad Gita chapter 17 to illustrate how different modes of nature influence our faith, understanding, and attraction to different types of food, reflecting our level of consciousness.

which we are chanting in the morning, Bhagavad Gita, Krishna also talks about the different kinds of Shraddha, the chapter is called divisions of faith based on the three modes of material nature, so Krishna talks about how according to the modes of material nature we are influenced, we have different kinds of faith, we have different kinds of understanding, and when it comes to food, Krishna talks about this is what they are attracted to, so people who are in the mode of ignorance, tamasa, tamasika, they are attracted to one kind of food because that is their nature, that is their consciousness is affected in that way, if they are in rajoguna, they are attracted to some, if they are in satvaguna, they are attracted to some other kind of food, if they are in mode of transcendence above all the three modes, they are attracted to something else. So, this is the important point, according to the level of development of consciousness we are attracted to different things, and what we are attracted to, from that you can conclude what is the level of the consciousness.

**Summary:** The speaker shares a story about Prabhupada discussing a popular Ramayana edition and emphasizing that true spiritual literature should bring readers to the spiritual platform.

So, arya hridyaha and similarly this another word paramahamsa mahamuninam anveshaniyacharanam, what are the paramahamsas and mahamunis, what are they seeking, what is it that they are looking for, that lotus feet of the lord, anveshaniyacharanam. So, this is the important thing, there was one conversation with Shila Prabhupada and some devotees brought up, some Indian guests brought up the discussion about one very popular edition of a Ramayan which is very well known in our country, and then they brought up that book and the discussion about that, and then Prabhupada started discussing, telling about that author and that how the author does not come in a proper parampara and is understanding his mixed with mayavada understanding, impersonal understanding, although he has written on Ramayana and so on, and then when the discussion went on, at one point Prabhupada brings out something very interesting, he says by reading that book, I have not come across one person who has come to the spiritual platform, not a single person has come to the spiritual platform. So, this is the intent of the original Vedic literatures or for that matter any spiritual literature, it is meant to bring the reader to the spiritual platform, it is a very wonderful test that Prabhupada sets out.

And if there is a literature and we want to judge that literature, we have to see if that literature is able to bring the readers and the followers of that literature to a spiritual platform. So, spiritual platform means the brahmabhuta platform, it means the liberated platform, and once you are on that liberated platform, your tastes will be different, you are charmed by different things, you are delighted by different things, and what are you delighted? The most exalted spiritualists, they are delighted by Lord Shri Krishna, his personality, his name, his form, his service, his pastimes, remembering them and chanting about the Lord's pastimes, chanting the Lord's holy name, this is what delights them.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the transformative power of Prabhupada's books with a news article about Pope John Paul II, setting the stage for a discussion about the contrast between worldly and spiritual tastes.

So, this is the important point that Prabhupada brings out that a literature has supposed to bring about the readers to the transcendental platform. We see that happening with Shri Prabhupada's books and the Gita and the Bhagavata, when we read these books, it brings about the change in the heart of people, we are inspired that yes, this is the goal of life, this is what we should be doing, not that we should be running after sense gratification like cats and dogs do, running after the senses. So, there was another news article just a few days before BBC released a documentary film and there was a news about that, the news is about Pope John Paul the second, he was the Pope, the Vatican, the head of the Catholic Church and he was the head for about 27 years.

**Key Quote:** "Look at his tastes, what are his tastes and what is he attracted to."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the controversy surrounding Pope John Paul II's letters to a married woman, questioning his tastes and attractions in light of his status as a saint.

And he was, and then they have somehow come to know, the BBC filmmakers got access to some about 350 letters that he wrote to one married woman over 30 years, and those letters reveal an intense friendship that he had with her which lasted for 30 years, and then they have analyzed the letters that some of the letters become intimate and so on, and so it goes on like that, and after about few years after he died in some time and then after his death he was also declared, they have a process, the Vatican church has a process and by which they declared him to be a saint also. So, we see on the one hand this is, he is considered to be a saint, a Pope for so many decades and look at his tastes, what are his tastes and what is he attracted to, and then it also says that how he went on a skiing holiday, he went on a camp and he went on a so on and so on with that married woman and so on, all those kind of things. So, we can see that by these kind of things and of course Srila Prabhupada made the very, very strong objection about all of them eating meat, so they are eating meat, they are having these kind of understanding and all of, so these are the things that delight them.

**Summary:** The speaker shares an anecdote about priests at a seminary who are allowed to watch movies and drink alcohol on weekends, contrasting this with Prabhupada's standard of reaching the spiritual platform through religious practice.

I remember once not very far from our temple here, there is one seminary and I had an encounter with some of the priests of that seminary, then when I was talking to them, they said that over the weekend they are allowed to go out of the seminary and go to a cinema, you can go and watch a cinema that is allowed, but in the seminary they should not watch anything, they should be very strict, and then they also said that in the seminary when they are in the seminary they have to be very strict, they cannot drink alcohol, but over the weekend when they are outside they can take a little bit of alcohol. So, this is the kind of thing, so you can see what there, what is the, in today's world, what is the understanding of spirituality and look at the standard that Srila Prabhupada sets, it should bring, one, one should come to the spiritual platform, Brahmabhuta platform, by the practice of religion, by the practice of spirituality, we should come to the Brahmabhuta platform, to the spiritual platform.

**Key Quote:** "Rasopyasya paramdrishtva nivartante."
**Summary:** The speaker analyzes the verse 'niraharasya dehinam' from the Bhagavad Gita, explaining the difference between abstaining from sense objects and achieving complete detachment through transcendental experience (paramdrishtva).

It's a very interesting verse, the verse talks about two things: niraharasya dehinam. One meaning of the word nirahara means not eating food, ahara nirahara, so not eating food, but here niraharasya refers to negative restricting principles, negative principles, don't do this, don't do this. vishaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinam rasavarjam rasopyasya. Here the niraharasya dehinam, one who is abstaining, following all of these negative restrictions, niraharasya dehinam, dehinam, a person who has an embodied person, a living entity, niraharasya dehinam vishaya vinivartante rasavarjam. vishaya vinivartante means he is abstaining from the vishayas, that's what the meaning of niraharasya, he is not supplying the vishaya. vishaya refers to indriyavishaya, so he is abstaining from vishaya, vishaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinam rasavarjam, only vishaya vinivartante rasavarjam, vishaya meaning rasa other than rasa, rasavarjam means apart from the sense of enjoyment, in other words the sense of enjoyment is still there, so he may be niraharasya dehinam vishaya vinivartante, but rasavarjam vishaya vinivartante, he is still attracted to that rasa for enjoying the vishaya is there, other than that, other than that he is abstaining from the vishaya, but rasopyasya paramdrishtva, what is that paramdrishtva nivartante, but when you do paramdrishtva, when you have the transcendental experience, raso api nivartante, even the desire, even the sense of enjoyment goes away. So, it is not that he is only abstaining strictly on the basis of certain principles that no I must not, one he has, one who has developed paramdrishtva rasopyasya paramdrishtva nivartante, so the first point in this verse is

vishaya vinivartante niraharasya dehina rasavarjam, this is the first point, he is niraharasya dehina, abstaining from vishaya and but his desire for enjoying the senses may still remain, but rasopyasya paramdrishtva nivartante, one who is paramdrishtva, one who has had the transcendental experience, even the taste goes away, that is the important thing. So here we see arya hridyaha, so in other words they are naturally drawn to the Lord. This is an indication, this is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu talks about, after sadhana bhakti one comes to the stage of a spontaneous devotion, one is drawn to Krishna, drawn to serving Krishna, chanting the holy names, hearing about Krishna, remembering Krishna, so that is the stage that one can come to. So, this is a great revelation by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, otherwise religion is considered simply to be a set of rules and following the rituals and doing this, doing that and all of those things, but no, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches that all of that is meant to change your heart and you should become arya hridyaha, you are delighted by Krishna, you are drawn to Krishna, you are charmed by Krishna's qualities, that is the stage one should aspire to come to.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the descriptions in the Bhagavatam are actual transcendental accounts of events in the spiritual world, as taught by the acharyas.

And here we see directly there is a mention in these kind of descriptions in the Bhagavatam that the Lord arrived there sahashrihi along with his consort, spouse, Prabhupada has used the word along with his consort, Sri Lakshmi Devi, so the Lord and Lakshmi both arrived there in the spiritual, in this particular place. So, we understand as the acharyas have described, have taught that these are all actual transcendental descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord, what happened in the spiritual world and we have to take this as it is.

**Key Quote:** "What kind of consciousness you have at the time of death decides the next body."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the trivialization of Vedic stories as myths by modern thinkers and Mayavadis, referencing the Bhagavad Gita to emphasize the importance of consciousness at the time of death.

Unfortunately in modern times we come across people who don't have this understanding and even the mayavadis have joined that kind of an understanding and they trivialize all of these things as no no these are all just mythical stories, these are fictitious stories, this is just a fiction, these are just not true stories, but that is not the way acharyas have described, like in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna is telling in the eighth chapter that we must always think of him, right? tasmat sarveshu kaleshu mam anusmaram yudhya ca mayarpitam anuva buddhir mam eva yasyasi asamsyeh and Krishna says that in what context, because Arjuna has asked the question what happens to, what state, what state one will attain after he leaves this body, so for that Krishna has said that what state of consciousness one has at the time of death determines the next body and then after saying that Krishna is saying therefore yamyam vapi smaran bhavam tyajatyante kalevaram, so what kind of consciousness you have at the time of death decides the next body and therefore tasmat sarveshu kaleshu mam anusmaram therefore think of me always and fight.

**Key Quote:** "You should think of me as one who has achintya roopam."
**Summary:** The speaker explains Krishna's instructions in the Bhagavad Gita on how to remember Him, emphasizing His inconceivable form (achintya roopam) and transcendental nature (tamasah parastat).

Now soon after that Krishna explains how we should think of him, it's a very nice instruction by Krishna, he says kavim puranam anushasitaram anoraniyam anoraniyamsam anusmaret yaha, so he says sarvasya dataram achintya roopam, very clearly Krishna is saying you should think of me as one who has achintya roopam aditya varnam tamasa parastat and his achintya roopa, this is how we should think of him, kavim puranam anushasitaram kavim, he is the most learned one who knows everything, the Lord is the knower of everything, kavim puranam he is primeval, most ancient, anushasitaram everything is under his anushasana, he is the giver of the rules, everything is under his control, kavim puranam anushasitaram anoraniyamsam and he is smaller than the smallest, the soul is considered to be very small, very fine and Krishna is so fine he can enter even the finest soul anoraniyamsam anusmaredhya in this way one should remember me, sarvasya dataram one who is the giver, one who is the maintainer of everyone, achintya roopam one who has got an inconceivable form, he has a form but that form is not conceivable by our material senses, he has a different kind of a spiritual form aditya varanam and his form is always luminous never in ignorance tamasah parastat he is parastat he is transcendental to this reality, this reality is called tamasah reality, dark reality because in this world everything is dark because of the sun, because of the light bulbs we have light otherwise this goes back to a dark state that is why this world is considered to be dark because of the sun this world is considered tamasah parastat and he is transcendental to that. So, very clearly in the Vedic literature this is, this aditya varanam tamasah parastat is a statement that comes in the Rigveda, is a statement that comes in the Shvetashvatar Upanishad.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the transcendental reality described in Vedic literature cannot be accessed through material senses or intellect, requiring spiritual learning and faith.

Many other Upanishads in the Bhagavad Gita, so again and again Vedic literatures have described that his position is transcendental, cannot be accessed by these materials, the material senses and the material mind and intelligence, you need another kind of a spiritual learning then you will be able to access that, then you will be able to experience param drishtva, you will be able to see, you will be able to experience that transcendental reality, there is a process one has to go through that process, by that process you can have access to that higher reality and so all of this is described, but still the mayavadis along with the other materialistic people who don't have faith in the Vedic literatures, they say all of this is myth, these are not to be taken seriously, if at all it has got some message, some good message you can take that, so that is why people think that

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by reiterating that the Bhagavatam teaches the ultimate, transcendental reality and should be understood as presented by the scriptures and acharyas, not through modern or Mayavadi interpretations.

educated people, intelligent people, they think that these are all just some entertaining stories and if you check the mayavadis even they will think in the same way, yes these are all some, it has a message and it has got no reality, but this is not the way acharyas have presented, this has a transcendental vedhyam vastu matra vastu vedhyam vastava matra vastu shivadam, this Bhagavatam is teaching us the reality, ultimate reality, vastu vedhyam, it enables us to understand the ultimate reality and that ultimate reality is a transcendental reality, not seen, not accessible to the material senses. So, these pastimes of the Lord have to be taken as it is and as it is given by the scriptures and as it is given by the acharyas and not be confused by these modern interpretations and the mayavadis interpretations. We will stop here grantharaj shivad bhagavatam ki sila pravupad ki.

**Key Quote:** "The Supreme Lord cannot be seen by ordinary eyes But he now became visible to the eyesight of the Kumaras"
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Supreme Lord is not visible to ordinary eyes but became visible to the Kumaras due to their devotion and meditation.

In this verse we find the word Achakshat Akshavishayam. The Supreme Lord cannot be seen by ordinary eyes, but he now became visible to the eyesight of the Kumaras. Another significant word is Samadhi Bhagyam. Meditators who are very fortunate can see the Vishnu form of the Lord within their hearts by following the yogic process, but to see him face to face is a different matter. This is only possible for pure devotees. The Kumaras, therefore, upon seeing the Lord coming forward with his associates, who were holding an umbrella and a chamara fan, were struck with wonder, and they were seeing the Lord face to face.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on how devotees, through love of God and devotional service, can see the Lord within their hearts and eventually face to face.

It is said in the Brahma Samhita that devotees, being elevated in love of God, always see Shama Sundara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, within their hearts. But when they are mature, the same God is visible before them face to face. For ordinary persons, the Lord is not visible. However, when one can understand the significance of his holy name, and one engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, beginning with the tongue by chanting and tasting Prasad, then gradually the Lord reveals himself. Thus the devotee constantly sees the Lord within his heart, and in a more mature stage, one can see the same Lord directly, as we can see everything else.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of the President of India visiting their temple, highlighting the extensive preparations and the large entourage that accompanied him.

Some years ago, we had a president of India visiting our temple here, and we had gone and invited him in Delhi, and then he agreed to come, and when he came, there were a lot of preparations made, and security personnel, protocol officers, they would advise us how to, what he should do, etc. And finally when he came, he didn't come alone. There was a motorcade of 24 cars all over on Hare Krishna hill. By the time the long motorcade came, and he got off, and there were a few cars before, and a few cars behind him, and all of them stood, the next two hours or so that he was there, all these cars were parked on the road, and all big cars, and big officials, like that. And when the president of India comes, it is a protocol that the chief minister, or the chief minister himself must come, the governor must come from the state. So all of them were there. So it's not a small thing when the president comes. And quite recently we had president of India coming to our temple in Vrindavan, which is far away. And there when he came, three helicopters landed. And so we were all waiting there and receiving, to receive him. First the governor's helicopter came from Lucknow. So that was another one. And then these three, Indian Air Force helicopters, massive helicopters. And they all landed there. So, when we see in this material world, a big person coming, it's marked with his entourage, and all of these kind of manifestations of his power and position.

And that's natural. And so here we see, when the Lord is appearing, naturally, and he also has his associates and entourage, all of them appear, and it's a grand appearance. Long ago, I had, I remember one interaction with a doctor. I had fallen sick, not very sick, some extent sick. And I had gone to a doctor. And this doctor was very friendly, very, very, he talks a lot with, he engages in a conversation with the patients. That's his one of his techniques, and puts them in comfort, and talks to them nicely. So he started talking to me, and he saw me because I was a devotee. Then he started asking, I can't remember the exact subject that we discussed. Something I mentioned about Krishna, Radharani, Lakshmi, Vishnu, and something like that. When you should please Lakshmi, then Narayana will be pleased. You please Radharani, Krishna will be, something like that we were talking. And then he heard all that and he said, very interesting. All of these are anthropomorphic concepts.

**Key Quote:** "Some people think and say, that our human ideas, we are imposing on, God. So this is called, anthropomorphic concepts."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the idea that some people believe religious concepts are human ideas imposed on God, dismissing them as mythology.

Meaning, he was saying that anthropomorphic means having human attributes. Like here we see, we have experience, if you want to get the check from a big man, our devotees often do. They go and please his wife. And when the wife is pleased, there is a good possibility you will get the check. So these kind of things are human experiences. And so some people think and say that our human ideas, we are imposing on God. So this is called anthropomorphic concepts. So this is what he was trying to say. And of course, I don't remember what I said, maybe I was not well enough to answer this kind of a question. So anyway, so people think that these are all ideas that have come from human society, now we are mapping on to the spiritual domain. And this is a kind of a human creation. Basically, it's an idea that it's a human creation. So that's how some people think. And the Mayavadis also have a similar idea. And they say that these are all just stories. Vishnu, Vishnu having four arms. Okay, here we have a human experience of two arms. And for the, because he is God after all, he should have something more than us, and let's give him four hands. You know, these kind of ideas. So these are all just mythology.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the anthropomorphic view with the traditional understanding of Acharyas, who do not dismiss these concepts as mere mythology.

They dismiss it like that. And they think that you should see some ideas, some good message behind that, that you must appreciate. So how do Acharyas explain this? If you study, none of the Acharyas, including Mayavadi Acharyas, will say like this, especially the Vaishnava Acharyas. They never derided these as mythological stories, a human idea carried forward to a spiritual realm. This is not the kind of an expression. No Acharya has ever said these things. Even Shankaracharya, he said, Narayano Paro Vyaktad. He said, yes, Narayana's existence, Para, is transcendental. So none of the Acharyas have said these things. And Srila Prabhupada, also following this, the line of the Acharyas, Srila Prabhupada, none of our Acharyas in our Sampradaya, none of them have said that these are all mythological, imaginary, some human idea imposed on divinity.

**Summary:** The speaker explains Srila Prabhupada's perspective that Krishna is not accessible to the mundane senses and is transcendental.

This is not the understanding. How does Srila Prabhupada explain this? Srila Prabhupada, like here it is explained in this verse. He is, Desa, Achakshata, Akshavishayam. Vishnu is not Akshavishayam. He is not a Indriyavishaya. But here, Achakshata, Akshavishayam, he, they began to see him. So, Vishnu's position, Krishna's position is, he is not Akshavishaya, he is not a Indriyavishaya. He is not seen, he cannot be accessed by our senses. This is again and again explained in the Vedic literature, Athashree Krishnanamadhi, Nabhavet Grahya Mindriyaihi. Indriyagrahya Nabhavet. Senses cannot access him. He is beyond the senses. He is beyond sense perception. This is what the Vedic literatures have often explained about Krishna's position. And Srila Prabhupada also says that, Yes, Vishnu or Krishna, he is transcendental. He is beyond material sense perception. He is not the subject matter of the mundane senses. And he is beyond the range of human sense, and mental and intellectual conceptions.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna's reality is beyond the reach of our limited mundane senses, which can only perceive a fraction of reality.

This is the understanding. This understanding is presented throughout in the Vedic literatures. And Srila Prabhupada also says the same thing. He is, Krishna's reality, the reality of Krishna or Vishnu, is inaccessible to our mundane senses. Our mundane senses can only access a certain amount of reality. Not even all of the material reality. Right? Our senses cannot understand. Our eyes cannot see the mind and intelligence. But we know people have mind intelligence, and they are working, and it is working. We can see the effects of the mind and intelligence, although we cannot see the mind and intelligence. So our senses have limitation. Even our mind and intelligence has limitation, what they can access in this reality, as material reality. So there is a certain reality beyond what is accessible to the mind, senses and intelligence. And Krishna or Vishnu belongs to that higher reality. So our senses don't have the powers to access that realm of reality.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a mobile phone unable to make international calls to illustrate that the limitations of our instruments do not negate the existence of a higher reality.

That is the important point. Just like suppose you have a mobile phone. And your mobile phone, you don't have international, you only have facility to make local calls, India calls. You can't make any call outside of India. And somebody comes and tells you, I have a friend in America, and this is the number of my friend. And you use your phone and try to call that number. It's an American number. Call will not go through. You try many times, it will not go through. Now somebody may say, no, no, you charge properly, then it may go through. You can have charge many times, still it will not go through. Somebody may say, no, no, you change your phone version, get a upgrade, a better phone. You can get a better phone, still you try, it will not go through. Go to a place where there is very good signal, and try. You can do anything you want, anything you want, you will not get the call. Then can you say, see, I have tried so much. I don't think you have a friend in America. Or even better, I don't think there is something called America. Because if there is, I must be able to make a phone call and talk. No, it is not so. Just because our phone, our instruments, cannot reach out, we cannot say such a reality does not exist.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the spiritual reality is beyond the reach of our senses, but there is a process to perceive the Lord, such as through samadhi.

This is the principle that is used by the Acharyas, by Srila Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada gave very contemporary articulation of this idea, that this reality, this spiritual reality is beyond the access, beyond the powers of our senses. This is the perception, this is the perspective that is presented in the Vedic literature. Now, if this is the reality, how do we ever know that reality? Is there a way to know that reality? Yes. Although the senses cannot perceive, atha shri krishna naam aadhi na bhaved grahyam indriyaihi sevon mukho hi jihvadau svayam eva sphurathi adaha. This is the way, this is the method that is given in the Vedic literatures, how to perceive the transcendental reality. And here in this verse, in today's verse, also it is described, that he is, he became akshavishayam, although he is not akshavishayam, he is adhokshaja. Adhokshaja means not accessible to the senses. Because, and he was samadhi bhagyam, sva-samadhi bhagyam. Lord is seen in samadhi, in trance. This is the idea. The senses ordinarily cannot perceive, but there is a process. If we follow that process, then we will be able to perceive the Lord in samadhi.

In the Vedic literatures, like in this verse in the Bhagavatam, it is describing how anupasyanti, pasyanti means to see. The Vedic literatures talks about tatva darshi vihi, those who have seen the truth. They are seeing the truth. So there is a way to see that truth. How to see the truth? yadangri abhidhyana samadhi dhautaya dhiyanupasyanti hi tatvam atmanah atmanah tatvam Atma here refers to Paramatma. Vishnu. Vishnu Tatva. So tatvam atmanah tatvam anupasyanti How one can see that? yadangri abhidhyana samadhi dhautaya Angri means the lotus feet of the Lord. Angri. yadangri abhidhyana When one does abhidhyana of Angri, the lotus feet of the Lord, and becomes mature, samadhi, reaches samadhi, fully absorbed in the lotus meditation of the lotus feet of the Lord, and by such meditation, dhauti, yadangri abhidhyana samadhi dhautaya dhautaya, dhauti means to become purified. And when one's intelligence is purified, samadhi dhautaya dhia dhautaya dhia When one's intelligence is purified, then, anupasyanti hi tatvam atmanah This is the way one can perceive

**Key Quote:** "Most people don't take the trouble of actually following the process, purifying the senses, purifying their consciousness by intense meditation, absorption on the lotus feet of the Lord. And hence they don't have a perception of the truth."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that most people don't achieve true realization due to a lack of dedication and instead rely on mental speculation, contrasting this with the Hamsa Guhyas prayers.

the transcendental reality. And then, in this verse, Shukadeva Goswami says, vadanti chaita kavayaya tharucham. And most people don't have this, come to this realization. Most people don't take the trouble of actually following the process, purifying the senses, purifying their consciousness by intense meditation, absorption on the lotus feet of the Lord. And hence they don't have a perception of the truth. But they still talk about the truth, and they talk in their own way, without proper understanding. That is why innumerable ideas and opinions have come about in this world about God. Those who have seen God, truly experienced God, they have one understanding, all the bona fide acharyas. So, vadanti chaita etat vadanti yatharucham vadanti kavayo As they want, their own opinions, they talk. But the Lord can be perceived in this way, same mukundo bhagavan prasidatam May that Lord Mukunda be pleased with me, and reveal His true nature. That's the prayer of Shukadeva Goswami. So, Lord can be, like it is explained here, samadhi bhagyam. They were seeing the Lord in their samadhi. And now, He became akshavishayam. They were able to see Him. In another place in the Bhagavatam, which we also chant, we used to chant, probably we chant occasionally, called the hamsa guhyas prayers in the Bhagavatam,

**Key Quote:** "Only ones whose heart has become completely pure, such people, can be experienced, that Lord, when one is in a state of complete purity, one will be able to experience the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Hamsa Guhyas prayers and emphasizes that only those with pure hearts, in a state of complete absorption, can experience the Lord.

a similar idea is described. Hamsa guhyas prayers were actually spoken by Prajapati Daksha. And generally, Daksha is not considered to be a very exalted person. Of course, he is one, in one sense in the material domain, considered an exalted person because he serves the Lord in his mission of creation of this material world, and populating the world. But still, his prayers are considered very special, and it has become part of the Bhagavatam, because Bhagavatam explains that he did not compose those prayers himself. Already those prayers were there in the Vedic literatures since time immemorial. And so those prayers, which were already present in the Vedic literatures, which he was trained in, so he offered those prayers, and hence, hamsa guhyas prayers have a transcendental significance, and it is part of the Srimad Bhagavatam. So, in this verse, in the hamsa guhyas prayers, Prajapati Daksha says, yaiyate kevalayasva samsthaya, hamsa yatasmai shucisadmane namah. Here again, hamsaya, the Lord's position is completely pure. Hamsa, generally, hamsa in Sanskrit means pure. It also refers to the swan, which is very pure, white, pure. And that's how very exalted persons are called paramahamsas, because they are very very pure. hamsaya tasmai shucisadmane namah. shucisadma, shuchi means pure again, sadma means an abode of purity. Only ones whose heart has become completely pure, such people, sadmane, yaiyate kevalayasva samsthaya, yaiyate, yiyate means to perceive, just like anupashyanti, tatvadarshinaha, seeing the Lord, experiencing the Lord, yaiyate, to experience, to perceive the Lord. kevalayasva samsthaya, again, kevalaya means in a complete absorption, state of complete absorption, swasamsthaya, in his original position, yaiyate, can be experienced, that Lord, hamsaya, shucisadmane, when one is in a state of complete purity, one will be able to experience the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "When our consciousness is saturated, spiritually saturated, in that state, one can perceive. This is the message in the Vedic literatures consistently."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights the consistent message in Vedic literature that spiritual perception requires a consciousness saturated with transcendental service.

So this is the position that the Vedic literatures have consistently presented. Whether it is in the ancient prayers of Hamsa Guhya, whether it is in the prayers of Shukadev Goswami, or it is in the Padma Purana, which Prabhupada often quotes, ata shri krishnanamadhi nabhaved grahyam indriyaihi sevonmukohi jihvadam, jihvadam. In one place in the Bhagavad Gita, when Prabhupada is quoting this verse, Prabhupada translates the words, the words, sevonmukaha, as when one is spiritually saturated with transcendental service. When our consciousness is spiritually saturated, saturated, we understand that when it is completely absorbed, and nothing else is there, remember in chemistry we used to study, concentrated, saturated solution, means it won't, it is fully saturated, nothing else, you can't add any more salt and it won't dissolve anymore, because the solvent is now saturated. In the same way, when our consciousness is saturated, no material conception, no material desires, no material contaminants, no contamination, no anartha, when it is saturated, spiritually saturated, in that state, one can perceive. This is the message in the Vedic literatures consistently.

**Key Quote:** "If we want to have a perception, a spiritual perception, a transcendental experience, we have to have, these words indicate, there is a certain amount of intensity, there is a certain amount of dedication, and absorption, that is essential."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the need for intensity, dedication, and absorption in spiritual practice, acknowledging the difficulties that may arise in service.

So now we can see, the Lord, the literature, Vedic literature is talking about Samadhi, here Samadhi Bhagyam, Dhyanupashyanti, Samadhi, Dautaya, and Shuchi Sadmane, spiritually saturated, which means, if we want to have a perception, a spiritual perception, a transcendental experience, we have to have, these words indicate, there is a certain amount of intensity, there is a certain amount of dedication, and absorption, that is essential. It's not some kind of a frivolous thing. And if we take it in a very frivolous way, like Shukadeva Goswami says, vadanti chaitat kavayoyata arucham, we will have our own understanding on, based on our mental speculation. But this is not a subject matter of mental speculation, spiritual reality, it is something that we can experience. And for that, it requires a certain dedication, certain intensity, certain absorption. So we should remember this, because life takes us through certain difficulties. When we are doing our service, even with devotees, very often difficulties will come about. Somebody will speak to us in a very harsh way, we will be hurt. Sometimes we will be discouraged by some experience, or we attempt something, and we don't get the result, some discouragement may be there. All of these kind of things will happen, and is bound to happen, in the life of a devotee.

**Key Quote:** "We should remember, what is the purpose of our existence? What is the purpose of our, what we are doing? Isn't it for that single purpose, of that spiritual experience, that we have come to Krishna Consciousness?"
**Summary:** The speaker reminds the audience that the purpose of their existence in Krishna Consciousness is to achieve spiritual experience, which requires dedication and intensity.

At that time, we should remember, what is the purpose of our existence? What is the purpose of what we are doing? Isn't it for that single purpose of that spiritual experience that we have come to Krishna Consciousness? It is not for some better material experience, for a more enhanced and amplified sensual experience, we are here. It is not for some kind of an honor, and distinction, and adoration, and good words from other people, that's not the purpose we are here. So we should remember that it is for that transcendental spiritual experience of the Lord, which the Vedic literatures are promising, the great Acharyas are offering. It is for that. And for that, it requires a certain amount of intensity, dedication. And when we remember that, and all of these material difficulties will become very simple and trivial. We will know how to face all these things. This is the greatest spiritual potency that comes about by our absorption, and that we can face any of the difficulties in this material world. So here we see that these sages now they saw what was actually, what they were seeing in their trance. Now they saw face to face. And throughout the purport, Srila Prabhupada has explained that yes, this is the way it is. At one stage of spiritual development, one will see the Lord in the heart, as Paramatma. And when one becomes more mature, in other words, there are in our spiritual progress, there are gradations. We can become mature, more mature, more mature, and become most mature. And when one becomes most mature, Prabhupada is making a statement, just like we see other things, we can see. Thus the devotee constantly sees the Lord within his heart, and in a more mature stage, one can see the same Lord directly, as we see everything else. You see. And Srimad Bhagavatam is presenting all of these ideas, so that we gradually, we understand the transcendental technique, the science and the technique,

of spiritual perception. And here in these cantos, early cantos of the Bhagavatam, describing about how Vishnu can be seen, and how the great sages saw Vishnu, in all regality, transcendental regality. Because Bhagavatam further intends to present even more higher concept, higher aspects of the absolute truth. Because the highest conception of the absolute truth is not even Vishnu. It is Krishna. And that Krishna, when the Bhagavatam describes about Krishna, and when you see Krishna in Goloka Vrindavana, He will not come with the transcendental regality, and the splendor that you are seeing in the Vaikunthaloka. He will just come with cows and calves, holding a flute, holding a stick, with simple cowherd boys. That is the highest conception of absolute reality. If you cannot have Vishnu conception, if you cannot experience Vishnu, no, forget it. You cannot have access to even higher concepts of the absolute truth. Krishna.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing how the Bhagavatam gradually prepares us to understand the transcendental realm, including the interactions and pastimes in Vaikuntha, to better understand Krishna's reality.

So we can see here how the Bhagavatam is gradually training us about the transcendental reality, gradually understanding. And what is this happening here? With all the chamara, beautiful swan like, appearing like swan, and on all the different paraphernalia, with the associates in grandeur, Vishnu made His appearance. Actually, this is Shantarasa. This is Shantarasa and Dasyarasa, which is prominent in Vaikuntha. Now, if you want to know the highest aspect of the absolute truth, then you must be familiar, and you must know even higher rasas, and what the transcendental interactions with the associates in higher rasa is like. So Bhagavatam is gradually preparing us, telling us about the different transcendental realm. How this transcendental realm of Vaikuntha, how the interactions and the pastimes happen there. Then we will be able to understand even further about Krishna, and Krishna's reality.

You go to a big store and there'll be CCTVs in different places. They'll put a board: "This area is under CCTV surveillance." That means they put a CCTV and they're informing you. Somebody could be watching or somebody is recording. And if we see such a board there, "This is a CCTV surveillance zone," we are careful. We become alert. We don't do some wrong things, right? In the Bhagavatam, it is said, Krishna is the witness of the innermost core of our heart. And the highest yogi is one who is devoted to Krishna in the innermost core of his eye. That is why in Bhakti, we cannot cheat at all. We may cheat externally, others, but Krishna is seated in the heart and He is watching. So we are...

**Key Quote:** "Prabhupada wants us to pursue very sublime, very noble, very exalted goal that is love of Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of having a mission in life, particularly self-realization and developing love of Krishna, as the most exalted goal.

We must have a mission in our life, so you should be preoccupied. There must be something very exalted in your life that you are pursuing. That's what gives meaning to your life, otherwise life is miserable. I was reading one Australian psychologist, he says, "When you get up in the morning, that exalted thing that you are pursuing in life should be the foremost thing that comes to your mind, and that energizes you. Wow, let me get up and do the work." Vedic culture tells us that the most exalted thing in human life that we should all be doing is self-realization. There are different grades of self-realization, and then there is the highest level of self-realization, and that is awakening our own relationship with the Lord. That should be the dominant thing in our life when we wake up in the morning. That should come to our mind. Prabhupada wants us to pursue very sublime.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "If you are able to somehow resist the temptation of these three exits, then you can head towards the supreme personality of Godhead."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of an expressway to illustrate how karma, mukti, and yogasiddhi can be diversions from the path of bhakti-yoga.

You're driving on the expressway, you're heading very quickly, but then you see exit, food court, and so you exit, and then you'll see so many different kinds of food all displayed there, and then you get absorbed and lost there, and then you missed the purpose that you were heading in the expressway. So, the shastras point out, when you are trying to advance in the mission of human life, you will encounter three exits. The first exit is called karma. The second exit is called mukti, and the third exit is called yogasiddhi. If you are not careful, you can take that exit, and you can be lost there completely, and forget coming back to the exit. So, you're driving on the expressway, and heading towards the goal that you set out. If you are able to somehow resist the temptation of these three exits, then you can head towards the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because, if you want to associate with Krishna, you should be free from the temptations of karma, jnana, and yogasiddhi. That is a pure devotee, who only wants to serve Krishna.

Then Srila Prabhupada came into our life, gave us spiritual knowledge, then we prepared ourselves for spiritual activities. So activity is a natural outcome of a certain knowledge and understanding.

Our bodies are activated, are animated, because there is Prana in this body. One day Prana will go, then the body will just remain. The body that we care for, the body that we feed and nourish, the body that we dress and give nice dwelling, will just become Panchabhutas. It will return to Panchabhutas, because Prana Shakti, Prana has gone. So Prabhupada translates Prana as the living energy. It's an energy. Chathai, Jaso, all of them are products of passion.

Now this passionate egoism, generally in the material world also people say, don't be so egoistic, right? If somebody is projecting oneself too much, then we say, you're so much ego you have, yes.

**Summary:** The lecture discusses how ahankara gives a sense of identity based on the body, such as gender, which is a false sense of identity.

This is an eighth element in the body, just like mind, we think, intelligence, we solve problems, we discriminate, this is right, this is not right, these are all functions of intelligence. In the same way there is an element of ahankara in us which gives us a sense of identity, I am. But it gives a sense of identity in terms of the body. I am a man, I am a woman, that's the first identity we all have, isn't it? Just as soon as we are born, a father, a mother, oh, boy is born, girl is born, you see? Connected with the body, the gender connected with the body. So. So this sense of identity, I am a man, I am a woman, from birth till death that continues.

This life we have taken a male form. In our previous life what we were? Maybe female form, maybe some other form. And in that body we think I am male, I am female. And because we have a male or a female human form, we think I am a human being. This is also part of our self-identity. You see, Vedic knowledge is dealing with these subjects about identity. What is going on in our mind? What is going on in our consciousness? Let's understand. What is the truth behind these things? And since we are born in India, we think I am an Indian man. I am an Indian woman. Someone else born in some other part of the country, they think I am American man. I am German woman or whatever.

This is the kind of a false egoism that is so intrinsic. We live with it. It comes with us all our life. Many things are decided because of these things. I am a man, I am Indian, I am woman.

Like this, many, many, many descriptions of ourselves, ourselves, in terms of the body, we create all through our life. This is the Ahankara manifestation. Next thing the Vedic literatures are pointing out. Now this Ahankara can come under three kinds of influence: Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. And this verse is discussing about this Ahankara under the influence of Rajas.

**Key Quote:** "The most important thing that Rajoguna does is, it puts us in a framework as I am an enjoyer."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how Rajoguna leads to the desire for enjoyment, often mixed with Sattva Guna (enlightenment) and Tamoguna (ignorance).

The most important thing that Rajoguna does is, it puts us in a framework as I am an enjoyer. So, I am an enjoyer. I must enjoy. Now I have a body. I must enjoy with this body. Sattva Guna creates a certain kind of an understanding. It enlightens. But usually in the material world, Sattva Guna is never alone. It gets mixed with Rajoguna. So, with a certain kind of an enlightened outlook, we try to become enjoyer. And it is not just that, Sattva Guna and Rajoguna mix. There is also always an element of Tamoguna. And Tamoguna's influence is to create ignorance. So, a sense of enlightenment and knowledge and understanding, with the fundamental desire to enjoy, but covered with a certain amount of ignorance.

**Key Quote:** "Intelligence to counteract the hard struggle for existence, is assisted by the senses for acquiring knowledge. And the living energy maintains himself, by manipulating the active organs, like the hands and legs."
**Summary:** This segment explains how knowledge, when combined with the desire to enjoy, leads to manipulating the world for personal gratification, resulting in a struggle for existence driven by passion.

This is actually what each one of us are. There is some knowledge. And knowledge, when it is charged with enjoying tendency, we look at this world, and we look at, we develop knowledge about this world, and how to manipulate this world, with our knowledge and understanding, for our enjoyment. You see? That's why Prabhupada says in the purport here, the living condition in material existence, depends more or less on one's intelligence and powerful living energy. Intelligence to counteract the hard struggle for existence, is assisted by the senses for acquiring knowledge. And the living energy maintains himself, by manipulating the active organs, like the hands and legs. But on the whole, the struggle for existence is an exertion of the mode of passion.

**Summary:** The lecture discusses how modern knowledge and technology are often used to manipulate the material world for personal enjoyment, stemming from a false sense of identity as a citizen of this world.

Today, there is so much knowledge of science, technology, economics, management. So, all of this is a certain kind of a knowledge. But, it is charged and influenced with Rajas. And so, we use our intelligence, we use our systematic thinking, we use our school and college education, everything, how to manipulate the material world, for my enjoyment. Now, this thinking that, I am a citizen of this world, and I must enjoy this world, this is actually an aspect of ignorance. Because we are not really a citizen of this world. We have come here. We are not these human bodies. We have got a human body. We see around us, there are so many other non-human bodies also. And there are living entities there also. So, this passion, knowledge, and ignorance, combine together, in different ways, and create the material world.

**Summary:** The lecture introduces Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings on detachment from material desires like wealth, followers, and sensual pleasures, contrasting them with the desire for pure devotion.

So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches, na dhanam, na janam, na sundareem, kavitam vajagadisha kamaye, kamaye, na kamaye, I don't want to desire, these things, na dhanam, kamaye, na janam, kamaye, na sundareem, kamaye, na kavitam.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts fleeting material pleasures with the pursuit of moksha and ultimately emphasizes Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's establishment of pure devotional service (bhakti) as superior.

So, in spiritual, in Vedic culture, we learn, these are all not, these are all fleeting things, all the pleasures, of the senses, the pleasures of wealth, the pleasures of women, the pleasures of honor, and fame, and position, and all these things, they are fleeting. Even going to swargaloka, that is also fleeting. Next, we should aspire for moksha, so that we can end, this birth and death cycle, and we can be situated in moksha, and in that way, in moksha there is, ananda of moksha. Again, ananda came there, enjoyment came there. No. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is saying, mama janmani janmanishvare, bhavata bhakti rahayi tukitvayi, I just want to render service to you, life after life. So, I do not want even moksha also. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is establishing the principles of pure devotional service.

**Key Quote:** "When we serve Krishna, we get happiness naturally."
**Summary:** The lecture uses the analogy of the hand feeding the stomach to illustrate how serving Krishna naturally brings happiness, contrasting it with the unnatural attempts at happiness through karma and jnana.

But of course, we are constituted in such a way, that when we serve Krishna, we get happiness naturally. The other methods were not natural to our constitution. Just like, if the hand puts food into the stomach, the hand gets nourished. Natural. But the hand putting the food in the stomach, is a natural constitutional activity. But if the hand says, no, I won't put food in the stomach, I'll only be touching the food. I'll only be mixing rice, chapati, dal, and just, I won't, why should I feed the stomach? Stomach should enjoy, is it? No, I won't allow. Only I'll be touching. Or I'll be only seeing food. We know that won't nourish us. You see, in the same way, all attempts of karma, all attempts of jnana, are attempts for happiness, in an unconstitutional manner. Constitutional meaning, Swaroopa, our makeup, how we are made, how we are constituted. This is the most important thing.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Krishna is the ultimate enjoyer and our purpose is to make Him happy, comparing our current material situation to a diseased and uncooperative part of Krishna's body.

That we are not the enjoyers. Krishna is the enjoyer. Krishna alone is the enjoyer. We have only business is to make him happy. Just like the hands, only business is to keep the body in a comfortable situation. We want to have bath, the hands and the legs will work to give bath. We want to dress up, we want to put tilak, hands and legs assist me to put the tilak. We want to eat, hands and legs help. See how hands and legs are parts of the body, they are constantly working for the upkeep and well-being of the whole body. If hands and legs don't cooperate, it is called a diseased condition. We have to go to a doctor, we have to take some treatment, we have to take some treatment. Hand is not working, I am not able to lift my hand, I can't bend, fold my hand. Oh, you have to go to your doctor, you should examine. See hand is not able to work for the whole. Today our material situation is, we are also components, parts of Krishna, but we are the diseased, uncooperative, unwilling to serve the pleasure, for the pleasure of Krishna.

We are that ailing arm. We are the diseased part of the body. This is what we have become today. This is our position. And this is coming because of our spirit of enjoyment. And that spirit of enjoyment is not natural to us. It is infused through the Rajoguna. Why, who is doing this? Krishna is only doing this. Oh, Krishna is, why Krishna is doing? Because we want it.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna has created this material world. You need a platform for activity."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna created the material world as a platform for our spirit of enjoyment and that even after entering spiritual life, the desire to be the enjoyer and controller persists.

He has given us a material body with the five senses, dasha indriya, dasha buddhi, and he has created this material world. You need a platform for activity. Suppose I am a great singer, or I am a great dancer, I am a great performer. All the artists, they always say, can we come to your temple and sing? Can we come to your temple? Of course, they are devotional people, they say. Because they want a platform for their activity. In the same way, we want a platform for our spirit of enjoyment. So Krishna has created this material world. See how this is what's happening. Now another thing that happens to us, Srila Prabhupada, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu won. Now we come to spiritual life, spiritual understanding, we come to a spiritual organization, but that spirit for enjoyment won't go away so easily. In the spiritual society, in the spiritual organization, we will try again, I should become the enjoyer, I should become the controller.

To free ourselves from that enjoying spirit, first is our determination and our desire that yes, I want to be free from this. And when Krishna sees that, when Balarama sees that, when Nithyananda Prabhu sees that, they will bless us. Because by our own we cannot get out. It's a Daivi Guna. These forces of Rajoguna, they are all divine. So it's very powerful.

That is why we must desire, we must make that desire sincere, and we must make that desire strong. And a strong desire is nothing but determination. And through that determination, we demonstrate to Krishna that I want to abstain from acts of enjoyment. We use our body, we act, we feed our body, take care of our body, to the extent of, to the extent required for self-preservation only. If you don't feed the body, we cannot do, the body will not have energy, we cannot do anything productive. So, some Shakti is required. So we eat, we sleep, we accept these some comforts, only to the extent of self-preservation. And otherwise, our intent is to only give pleasure to Krishna. So, this enjoying tendency created by passion, how this is all brought about...

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding our situation and constantly reminding ourselves of Vedic knowledge through classes, reading, and discussions for self-purification, especially in Kali Yuga.

So we should know our situation, we should know this, what is happening, so that we can be constantly reminded in Kali Yuga, or in every time in a material existence, a mind is weak. And we need to constantly remind ourselves. That is why the Shastras are there, Vedic knowledge is there, so that we refresh our memory, our intelligence, our understanding, daily, by class, by reading books, like Srila Prabhupada has given those, these books. So, and by discussing among ourselves, and by telling others, because when we are telling others, first person who is hearing is ourself. I am giving class, but the first hearer is, some of you may slightly doze off a little, you won't, something you may miss. But one person who is not missing anything, very attentively hearing the class, is myself. So it is for my own purification. So, we speak in different kinds of forum, one on one, one to many, or different ways, mean our purification, self-purification, self-purification. This is the most important thing that we should try for.

And what is just like you study in anatomy you see there is a bone stress skeletal structure that gives strength to this body there is a muscular structure there is a nervous structure nervous system in the same way that what is energizing this body is the consciousness and that consciousness is the sitting place ultimately of karma that karma sitting in consciousness it will just sit there no it will come through mind intelligence and senses so that we can act and we can fulfill that karma for our karma is not a static thing desire is not a it is it is dynamic force you see and the dynamism is brought through these instruments of mind intelligence and sense organ like that so kama is sitting in all these places krishna is describing.

**Key Quote:** "In an ideal pure devotee state even he is in the material world we He is called a Jeevan Mukta."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that spiritual advancement involves decreasing the desire for personal enjoyment and increasing the desire to serve Krishna, culminating in the state of Jeevan Mukta, where one is fully devoted to Krishna even while in the material world.

Our desire to enjoy the material world is 100, our desire to enjoy to serve Krishna 0 in one sense. But okay, we have moved up in spiritual life, maybe 95 percent is desire to enjoy and 5% we want to serve Krishna, we have understood little bit. This is our situation, we have a mixed situation. So the material world is a platform, is an opportunity where we can try to experience that ninety-five percent desire to enjoy oneself and also 5% to serve the Lord. And as we become spiritually advanced, 95 keeps decreasing, the five keeps increasing. And in an ideal pure devotee state, even he is in the material world, he is called a Jeevan Mukta. He is in this material world. 100% desire to serve Krishna, 0% to enjoy himself. He is called Jeevan Mukta.

There is a dual situation like you are describing. But the struggle of a spiritualist is how I can minimize my self-enjoyment, sense my self-enjoyment, how I can maximize Krishna's enjoyment. In the spiritual world, everyone, 100% is engaged in serving the Lord and giving pleasure to the Lord. That's another world. Just like here you see there is one world here. Everyone. Everyone is trying to enjoy for oneself. But we have some religious, due to culture. Our parents were taking us to temple. We had some religious functions in our home. So there is some cultural religiosity is there. By culture there is some, which recognizes God. And hence, we go to God. We go to a temple and pray. Krishna, I've got these so many desires. Can you please bless me so that I can enjoy in this world? Yes. But we are going to temple. That's Bhakti. Yes, that's Bhakti. It is called Mishra Bhakti. Karma Mishra Bhakti. It is Bhakti, but largely combined with the desire for enjoyment.

**Summary:** The lecture explains that through bhakti, unwanted desires (anarthas) gradually diminish, leading to a stronger desire to serve Krishna and becoming a strong devotee.

But by doing Bhakti, Anartha Nivrutti Syat, what happens is that all these desires for enjoying, gradually diminishes. Anartha. These are unwanted things. They are valueless things. Anartha. Artha means valuable. Anartha means no value. They have no value for us. Truly. But we are holding on to it. Now Bhakti makes us release all that. Nivrutti. Anartha Nivrutti. So gradually that desire for self-enjoyment diminishes. And the desire to serve Krishna increases. And when it is more and more stronger, then we are called strong devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that Svargaloka offers enhanced material enjoyment but lacks true spirituality, reiterating Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's preference for pure devotion over the path to Svarga.

Yes, the body changes. Yes. What? . No. Svargaloka, these are all different arrangements for more material enjoyment. Not much of spirituality there. In Svarga, you will get a body which has a long life. We only live for about 100 years. Out of 100, after 70, what enjoyment you can do? Your body has become very old. So, in Svargaloka you will have 1000 years life. So long you can enjoy. So, Svarga is nothing but an opportunity for enhanced enjoyment. For one's own enjoyment, not for Krishna. But that also with Krishna's blessing. So, this is the kind of a situation. Svarga is also not desirable in that sense. That's why Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is saying, Na kavitam. I don't want to follow this path of Svargaloka, Vedic path and go to Svarga. I don't want that. Janmani janmani Ishvare bhavatad bhakti rahaituki. Bhavatad bhakti. Your devotion is only, I am asking.

**Summary:** The speaker establishes that everything, including our bodies and strength, belongs to Sri Rama, and we should use them in His service.

I have come into this world, I have this Panchabhuta Sharira, Antribhuta Sharira, Sukshma Sharira. To whom does all this belong? Am I the owner of all this? Am I the owner of this body and the owner of the senses? Am I the owner of myself? To whom do I belong? Oh, we have this body, whatever strength we have, may not be much, but all of this belongs to Sri Rama, and we all belong to Sri Rama. We must use all of this to serve Rama. This is the thinking of a Bhatta. This world belongs to the Lord. Isha Vasya Midam Sarvam. Everything that is there, everything, the Lord is the owner. The Lord is the owner.

Rishabhadeva, Paramahamsa in Avadhoota Vesha, he appeared. Unless one comes to the stage of Paramahamsa, one cannot experience Krishna Bhakti in its full form. Paramahamsa stage, where you are uncaring for the material world. You don't care for honour, dishonour, pleasure. You are no more searching for pleasure in this material world. Bhagavatam describes Parikshit Maharaj, who was an emperor, was a Paramahamsa. He was in kingly robes. Prabhupada writes, Paramahamsa is required in every field of human activity, because Paramahamsa always thinks, how I can do good for others. But this Paramahamsa Dharma can be practiced in other ways, in Avadhoota Vesha also. Somebody who is a ruler, he should be a Paramahamsa. Somebody who is a businessman, he should be a Paramahamsa. Somebody who is a housewife, she should be a Paramahamsa. Somebody who is a child, a child can also be a Paramahamsa, like Prahalad Dhruvavahar. That should be the goal of human life, to come to the Paramahamsa stage, because in that Paramahamsa stage, one can actually experience...

#### Lord's enjoyment, free will, rasa, relationship
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=167
**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So that one personality becomes many for the purpose of relationship, for the purpose of enjoyment."
**Summary:** The Lord creates living entities to experience relationships and enjoyment, granting them free will to facilitate genuine rasa.

So, it's a battle for the demon, but it is a friendly fight, a playful fight for the Supreme Lord. Because the Supreme Lord does not have to fight with anybody. Right? He can only fight with one person. That is himself. There is nobody else to fight with. But being the Supreme person, being a personality with all the emotions in its most supreme, excellent position, he also has the tendency to fight. What does he do? Just like he has a tendency to exchange emotions, he has a tendency to enjoy rasa, raso vai saha. He is full of rasa, and he is the enjoyer of all the rasas. So, what does he do? He has to create Radharani. He has to create all the sakis. He has to create all the devotees. He has to create all the living entities. So that one personality becomes many for the purpose of relationship, for the purpose of enjoyment. But if there has been enjoyment, and if there has been a relationship, then one thing he has to give up. He has to give up one thing. That is free will. If it doesn't give free will, if he is controlling the living entities he has created, if he is controlling all the people he has created, then it becomes... There is no rasa in that. Rasa comes when there is unexpected situations. You don't expect something. Suddenly something comes up. Then the enjoyment is more. If you already know what to expect, then there is no enjoyment there. When you receive something unexpectedly, then the rasa, the taste is more. You suddenly go somewhere you don't expect, suddenly get nice prasadam. Even though it is not tasty, you feel it is very tasty. You are very hungry. You didn't expect. So, to give that, rasa of the unknown, the Lord gives up the free will. So the living entities have only one thing. That is his free will. Everything else is Lord. He is also part of the Lord. Part and parcel of the Lord. There is no difference between the living entity and the Lord, except for the quantum. Both are spirit. Quantity wise maybe. So he gives that free will. So that is the free will which is used by the living entities. And using that free will, the Lord makes the living entity give him pleasure. The living entities are part and parcel of the Lord. So just like the part and parcel is used by the whole, the Supreme Lord uses the living entities by making the living entities act the way he wants.

#### material world, friendly fight, Lord's love

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "All the bad words you throw upon the Lord is received as a loving flower."
**Summary:** The material world is a place where living entities try to imitate the Lord, but the Lord responds with love, even to negative actions.

But many of the living entities are not qualified. All of them, like us, find place in this material world. So that is how the Supreme Lord exchanges relationships. So for him here, it is a friendly fight. Just like a father would fight. The gloves also father has given to the son. Right? Everything that the son has to fight the father. Suppose the father is a king. He wants to fight with the son. He gives a sword to the son. All the elements to fight is given by the father. And the father says, now you fight. Right? Sometimes the father shows he is also defeated. Because the father feels pleasure in the success of the son. Similarly, the Lord also feels pleasure in the success of the living entities. Only one thing is not possible when the living entities start imitating and acting like the Lord. That is not possible. Because there is only one Lord. So when Hiranyakasya, Hiranyakashipu, all the living entities try to act like the Lord, then, still the Lord is loving. The Lord doesn't say, you are dismissed. You are banned. If he bans, where will the living entity go? So he himself has to create the living entity's place. So he creates a material world. And he says, all of you go there and try to become like me. So we have Hiranyakasya and Hiranyakashipu here. Trying to fight the Lord. But what is the use of fighting the Lord? All the bad words you throw upon the Lord is received as a loving flower. All the beating that Hiranyakasya does to the Lord is also received to him as pleasure. So you cannot overcome that. You cannot overcome the Lord in any way. That's not possible. The living entity can get overcome by the Lord's love. So that is the interaction between the Lord and the living entities.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord doesn't mind even taking such an so-called abominable, so-called lowly, so-called not cared for form of varaha."
**Summary:** The Lord takes even the most humble forms, like Varaha, for the pleasure of Himself and His devotees, demonstrating His all-encompassing nature.

And this material world, of course, is created. And in this material world, the Lord comes in most abominable form also. He doesn't mind. Paraha. Hedgehog, they say. Most abominable. Like before we saw Hiranyakasya, he is saying, you are such a lowly being you are. Lowly being of this, of a hog, of a varaha. Wild boar. Nobody cares for a wild boar. Why did he take the form of a wild boar? Because earth is lost. It has been sniffed. It has been smelled and found out. And nobody is as expert as smelling like wild boar. You cannot keep anything away from a wild boar. It will sniff and find out. It is a very lowly animal, but very expert. His sense of smelling is so strong. Right? Hiranyakasya cannot even hide earth from it. He will smell and find out. That is why boar incarnation. Just smell out the earth. Right? So human beings don't care for this. The Lord doesn't mind even taking such an so-called abominable, so-called lowly, so-called not cared for form of varaha. He doesn't mind. Varaha is very useful also. The mud which is tilled by the horns, by the horns of the varaha is very useful. They say, when for worship, we use this soil from the anthill, we use soil from the tulasi root, we use soil from the horn. In the morning, in the night, the hogs come and they till the soil to take the roots and eat. So that soil is used. When we do Brahmosa, we do Ankura Arbana, we use soil from different places. One of the soil is the soil from the horn, tilled by the horn of varaha. So we may not understand the usefulness of varaha anyway. So the point here is, the Lord doesn't mind taking this kind of form also for the pleasure of His pleasure and the pleasure of the devotees.

#### dodging death, transcendentalism, detachment

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So the process of dodging death, that is the goal of life."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Lord dodges the maze of Hiranyaksha like a transcendentalist dodges death, which is achieved by disconnecting from the material world and identifying as spirit soul.

So that is the situation here. But here, Sukte Goswami very clearly explains, the Lord is dodging the maze of hidden action. So if you look at it, He is dancing, sidestepping, maze fight. Duryodhana, Bhima, all these people are great maze fighters. So we look at the maze fighters, if you look at any fighter, you have to see, you have to block others beating, you have to avoid others beating, you have to give a punch. So it is a real fighting. There is a big war going on there. So the Lord is dodging the maze, maze blows of hidden action, just like a transcendentalist would dodge death. So He gives that comparison. So the transcendentalists are expert in dodging death. How does that happen? Well, in the sense, dodging death means you avoid the influence of the material world, because death is part of this material world. Soul doesn't die. So when soul doesn't die, who is dying here? Transcendentalist doesn't die. He is soul. How can soul die? It is the body which is dying. Body which is a part of the material world, which is dying. Body which is the product of the influence of the three modes of material nature, which is dying. And He was never that body. So transcendentalists never die. It is the living entities who think that He is a body, which has an end, think that there is death. For a spiritualist, there is no death. So the Lord is dodging this maze, just like a Vaishnava, a Brahmana, a qualified spiritualist who avoids death. Well, not only the Vaishnavas, even a Mayavadi tries to dodge death. Any transcendentalist, whether he is a Mayavadi, he is a yogi, he is a Brahmana, he is a Vaishnava, they all dodge death. But dodging death is possible only when you disconnect with the material world. Until that disconnect comes, because you think, I am the body. As long as we think that we are the body, and the body ends, we cannot dodge.

#### goal of life, body consciousness, transcendental qualities

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The goal of life is to avoid death."
**Summary:** The goal of life is to avoid death by understanding that we are not the body, leading to freedom from anxiety and a sense of unlimited abundance.

So the process of dodging death, that is the goal of life. For the living entities who are this material world. Most of the people in the material world do not know what is the goal of life. So if they ask us, we will say, the goal of life is to avoid death. A scientist will say, not possible, you are wasting your time, because you have to die. Because he is thinking that he is the body. But a devotee is thinking that he is not the body. He knows he is not the body. The fact is that he is not the body. When he is a spirit soul, how does death overcome spirit soul? Death overcomes spirit soul as soon as the spirit soul mis-sanitizes himself as a dieable object. So people in the material world, when we are absorbed in sense gratification, absorbed in the body, conscious of the body, the consciousness is always thinking of the body, the body's pleasures, body's pains, avoiding body's pain, acquiring body's happiness, when the entire action in his life is centered around the body, then he becomes body conscious. When he becomes body conscious, then he becomes death conscious. A transcendentalist is not death conscious. Because he doesn't die. He doesn't disappear into thin air. He is always existing. So when he understands that, the first thing that comes in his heart is happiness. Because all unhappiness is because you think this is going to finish. All sadness, all anxiety happens because I think I am going to lose this. So when you know that you are always going to exist, there is no point in finishing, then you don't have anxiety. So first sign of transcendentalist is free from anxiety. First sign is his tripti, he is satisfied. Why? Because he has no anxiety, he doesn't finish. So he is always rejoicing, he is always happy. So the quality of a transcendentalist is this, he is free from this fear, he is free from this anxiety, he is free from this dissatisfied situation of material things that I have only this much. I have everything. Because the Lord has everything. I am part of the Lord. Whatever belongs to the Lord is mine. There is no limit for a devotee. There is no limitation for a transcendentalist who thinks that he is not the body. So that is the qualification

**Key Quote:** "So as soon as you become free from the three modes, you become free from death."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that dodging death is a daily fight to balance the trigunas and tridoshas, ultimately leading to freedom from the influence of the material world.

of a transcendentalist. The point, how does he avoid? So that is the process every individual person, a sadhaka, like us, the whole day, whole life is spent in how do we dodge? We dodge disease, illness. Nobody wants disease. Keep good health. I know they say, tridoshas, you have tridoshas. Any imbalance in this tridoshas creates ill health. So we maintain this balance of these tridoshas so that you don't become ill. There is no disease. The same way it is said that you have to maintain trigunas, balance of trigunas because mind is influenced by these trigunas. So as much as the balance of the trigunas are important for the body, the balance of the tridoshas are important for the body, the balance of trigunas are important for the mind because happiness is what? It is a mental concept. Body is unhappy when it is diseased. Mind is happy when it is free from the influence of three modes or it has more of sattva guna. So this is the daily fight a transcendentalist faces. How does he balance or rather how does he avoid the three modes of material nature? Triguna rahitaha. How to be free from the influence of three modes? So as soon as you become free from the three modes, you become free from death. For such a person, there is no death. Vaishnava has never died. In fact, no living entity dies. But Vaishnava has never died because he is totally free from this concept of death. He is free from the influence of the three modes of material nature.

#### material world, upside-down tree, three modes
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/1sZaBCmjaYQ?t=1057
**Verse References:** BG 15.1
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This world is nothing but an upside down of a good world."
**Summary:** Drawing from the 15th chapter of Gita, the speaker describes the material world as an upside-down tree, nourished by the three modes of material nature, and sustained by the actions of living entities.

So that is why Krishna as in 15th chapter he says, a person who understands this material world, he understands very clearly what is happening in this world. Hence he says, what is this world? In 15th chapter of Gita, most important chapter, where Krishna says, urdhamulam adasyakam. You want to know what this world is? This world is nothing but an upside down of a good world. This is a perverted reflection of the right world. This is a wrong house. This is an upside down house. You belong to a house which is totally different. But I can try to explain to you, this world is an upside down world. And this is like a tree which is standing on a reservoir. The reflection is seen on the reservoir. The roots are up. The branches are down. The leaves are down. The leaves are the Vedas. The twigs are the fruits of the senses, objects of the senses. Sense activities. And this tree also has new roots coming. This tree also has new shoots coming. And this tree is fed by the three modes of material nature, sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna. It is like growing up a tree using manure. What is the manure for this tree? Urea for this tree is sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna. These three gunas are the nutrients by which the tree is growing. And what is the fruit of the tree? The new twigs. And all this is resting in the action of the living entities. If the living entity is acting in this material world, using these three gunas, sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna, which are the nutrients, naturally new roots will come. Just like in a banyan tree, new roots come. Very thin roots come. When they are very small, easy to pick and throw. But as they touch the ground, and they also start sucking the three gunas, the nutrients, they also grow strong. So by the action of the living entities, by the influence of three modes of material nature, the nutrients are going to this tree called samsara. And this tree called samsara is growing and growing and growing. And it comes to a point where you cannot cut it anymore easily. The more nutrient is taken, the tree becomes very strong. You cannot cut it. A tree which is very small, you can easily take it away. But allow it to grow. Allow the extra roots to come. Who is feeding it? Nobody external is coming and feeding it. We ourselves are feeding it by our action. What kind of action? The actions which are influenced by either sattva guna, raja guna, tamma guna or a combination of these. So actions in this material world,

**Key Quote:** "Actions in this material world, is a cause of bondage."
**Summary:** Actions influenced by the three modes cause bondage, but by using free will to act in a way that leads to liberation, one can dodge death.

is a cause of bondage. And Lord says, he who knows this tree, he can dodge death. He can be free from the influence of this tree. Don't try to understand this tree. You figuratively know what this tree is, but don't try to go deep to the tree. But what the transcendentalist do? He doesn't go deep. He takes a knife and cuts the roots. As fast as possible, he can cut the roots and come out of this bondage to this earth. And you belong to a different world. Not that bhaa sheti, surya ho, na shashanko, na pavaka ha. A world where there is no need of any artificial light. A world where there is no need of any sadness, no sorrow, no limitation, no anxiety. A world which is totally free. So we belong to a world which is as free as them. As free as that. But now we belong to a world where there is limitations by death. Hence, a transcendentalist becomes expert in dodging death. Cheat death. How does he do that? The medicine is with him. His own actions. When a transcendentalist uses his action through his free will, in a particular way, he gets bound. When he uses his free will in another way, he gets liberated. So that one item what the Lord has given, that is a free will, action means free will. You are free to act whichever you want. So he has given that free will. The same free will with which you would give pleasure to the Lord is now misused to become sad. Is misused to be limited by death. Is misused to be mixed in anxiety. So spiritual life only means that taking that aspect of action and putting that action in a different place which gives better result and the result is liberation. And when these actions are used in the activity of liberation, then you are called a person who is dodging death.

#### dodging death, constant vigilance, Lord's emotions

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "You have to dodge death every minute because any second you can get stuck."
**Summary:** Dodging death requires constant vigilance and cutting the roots of material attachment, and the Lord also displays emotions like fear and anxiety for the sake of His devotees.

And that is the goal of life. Every minute, every second, that is a Buddha Yoga. This is not some artificial emotion, this is a Buddha Yoga. It is a minute to minute thing. You have to dodge death every minute because any second you can get stuck. Like in Gita, Krishna says any one of the senses, inattentively, can create another root. Root is going so fast. So you have to be a very smart fighter. Take the knife and you have to be very fast. Every time keep cutting, cutting, cutting. What am I doing this medieval? Keep cutting the roots. Thin the tree down. Don't allow the tree to go lost. And this tree, where is the tree growing? In our hearts. So if this material tree is made to grow thick by our misused actions, misplaced actions in the material world, then we end up in dying. The moment we take it out, we become free from death. No death. Hence just like a transcendentalist who is trying to dodge death, the Lord is fighting. So the cue here is how does a transcendentalist dodge death? That becomes the goal of life. Apparently it looks like the Lord is in anxiety. He is trying to get freedom from this maze, powerful maze of Hirinaksha. He is scared of Hirinaksha. Lord also shows his emotions of fear. Arjuna caused so much of fear to the Lord. We know when Abhimanyu was killed. Arjuna was so struck with sorrow. He forgot what he see, what he should say. He said, if I don't kill this person tomorrow, I will die. He said, what are you saying? This is exactly what the Kauravas are looking at. Either to kill you or make a situation where you die yourself. Kshatriyas are like that. If they don't commit, if they don't do what they say, then they say, okay, I give up this. I give up that. I kill myself. I enter fire. Arjuna said, I will enter fire. The Lord said, the Lord said, I didn't sleep in the night. The Lord also doesn't sleep in the night. He also has anxiety. For what? For the cause of the devotees. So the Lord has this rasas. Why? Because this world is real. There is pain and pleasure in this world. There is endeavor in this world. There is hard work in this world. There is frustration in this world.

#### endeavor, karma, Lord's sanction, dodging death

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This world is made so real, that one has to endeavor."
**Summary:** The material world is a place of endeavor, limited by karma and time, but ultimately controlled by the Lord's sanction, and dodging death means dodging these influences.

This world is made so real by the Lord that we have to struggle. Three things are there in this world. One is our endeavor. Every time we endeavor for something to success, achieve something. Free from hatred, free from happiness, free from unhappiness, or achieve happiness. These are two things we do. Endeavor is always there. But we are limited. We are not free to endeavor. Not that you do anything, you will get the result. You are limited by time. Limited by our past. Limited by our own karma. Right? And then, even if you have good karma, sometimes you may not get it. Why? Large interference is there. So this world is made so real, that one has to endeavor. While endeavoring, one is limited by one's past. And even if it is limited by the past, if the Lord's sanction is there, you get it. So by seeing this world, one understands there is something different. Somebody is controlling this world. I am not free. If I was free, I should work hard and I should get the result. But you see people working hard, opposite result. Viparyaya, you get the opposite. You try for something, but you get the exact opposite. Or sometimes people don't work at all, he is getting everything automatically. So big debate in Shastra is, what is the reason for result in this world? Is it endeavor? Is it karma? Or the Lord? Of course, it is a combination of all these three. So Krishna has created this world where he makes the living entities endeavor. Work hard, work hard, work hard. Again action. Again free will. The same free will what he has given to the living entities, he is making the living entities work hard. Endeavor, endeavor, endeavor. But, you have come and gone many times here. So many pending accounts are there. It depends upon that. Even great athletes work hard day and night they work. On the day of the play, no result. So they say, I didn't have a good day. So having good day is important or struggling for so many years is important. Why struggle at all? Some people don't struggle at all. You have a good day by your past karma. So the world is made so real by the Lord, by a combination of all these things. And the living entities who understand this, he knows, I am limited by all these things. And finally, I am limited by death. So how do you dodge death? Say a person dodging death means he dodges all these influences of karma, influences of time, influences of the three modes. Then he can dodge.

**Key Quote:** "Totally be absorbed in expanding this movement."
**Summary:** Spiritual life is not sentimentalism but practical action, and Prabhupada advises devotees to be absorbed in expanding the Krishna consciousness movement as the best way to be free from Maya.

So this world is a very practical world. It is not just, and spiritual life is not just sentimentalism. Like Prabhupada said, it's an art of working. It's a place of action. A lot of activities are happening. The devotees are engaged. When devotees ask Prabhupada, what is the best way to be free from Maya? How to be free? It's very difficult to be free. We are sitting in Maya. Sitting in the influence of all these modes. Prabhupada says, totally be absorbed in expanding this movement. It's very difficult to be free. Totally be absorbed in expanding this movement. Because expanding this movement means what? This problem, that problem, this thing, that thing, this devotee, that devotee, man, material, all kinds of problems are there. So sometimes we think, is this spiritualism? I thought ashram means vishram. Ashram means vishram. Prabhupada said, this is not a place of vishram. It's a place of action. It's a place of great battle. Great problem. We don't think. We come in a temple, we sit and everything is there. Prasad comes in time. Dress comes in time. Vehicle comes and stops. So sometimes we forget. There is a great endeavor required to achieve all these things. But Krishna gives all these things free for the devotees.

**Key Quote:** "Engage in Krishna consciousness. Engage in expansion of Krishna consciousness."
**Summary:** Dodging death is easily achieved by engaging in Krishna consciousness and expanding the movement, and the material world is real because it gives the real fruit of liberation.

Why does Krishna give these things free for the devotees? So internally, he can engage all these things in Krishna's service. So Prabhupada says, we want to be from maya. So dodging death, a transcendentally sitting om, doing all these hatha yogas, controlling his breath, controlling the five ayus in the body, detaching the mind from the senses, or a mayavadi saying, neti neti neti, not this, not this, not this, and trying to be away from this material world. A devotee, free. Easily he can dodge death. What is it? Engage in Krishna consciousness. Engage in expansion of Krishna consciousness. Such a simple formula Prabhupada has given. Dodging death? No problem. No need of hatha yoga. No need of mental speculations. No need of even Sankhya yoga. Sankhya yoga is also one of the methods of dodging death. Analyzing this material world and finding out the intrinsic. Sarvasya sarvaatmana atmavasthuna. The Lord is everywhere. He is in, He is the heart of everything and He is also the intrinsic aspect of everything. Intrinsic quality of everything. There is nothing other than Him. No need of that also. Simply act. Simply act in the activity of preaching. Expanding the movement. So it's a real world. In this real world, mayavadis say this world is not real. Devotees don't say that. This world is real. As much as its temporariness is understood, but it is real. Because if it is unreal, you won't get a real fruit. Just like you say, this is an image of a mango tree, but I got real mango. You can't get a real mango from an image of a mango tree. You have to go to a real mango tree, climb and get the fruits. So if liberation is the fruit of the actions in the material world, how can I get liberation from a false world? And a false world? Non-existing world? So the understanding of the devotee is that the world is Bhagavata understanding. Bhagavata conclusion is that the world is not unreal. World is real. Because it gives real fruit, which is liberation.

#### purpose of the world, growing roots, free will

**Key Quote:** "Action is the only way to get liberation."
**Summary:** The purpose of the world is to achieve liberation, and devotees should avoid growing roots in material attachments, using their free will to dodge death through practical action.

That is the purpose of the world. You may not use it for that purpose. You may use it for your own sense gratification. Then you get caught up in that. Many times people get caught up in this world of materialism and get frustrated. When they get frustrated, they say the world is not real. When they are enjoying, they don't say the world is not real. But the devotee may be utilizing everything in this material world. He may enjoy also. Ambarish Maharaj, Dhruva Maharaj, all these people, they enjoy the material world, according to their karma. But, they were not growing roots. By the action of Dhruva Maharaj, even though he was a king and ruling, he didn't grow roots. The problem is growing roots. Similarly, in our preaching movement, when we preach and engage in Krishna consciousness, we should see that roots are not grown. We don't get stuck with a particular service. We don't get stuck with a particular situation. We don't get stuck with a particular position. We don't get stuck with a particular concept. Everything is the roots of, if the roots are built here, then there is no difference between the activity inside and activity outside. Because action is the only way to get liberation. And that action is nothing but the real form of free will. Because there cannot be any action if free will is not there. So this particular thing which the Lord has given to the living entities is used, and the purpose of the use is to dodge death. So the Lord's action here is, is nicely compared by Sukhothi Goswami. And that is the purpose. This is why Sukhothi Goswami is, he brings out these concepts in Bhagavatam, which force us to realize, by realization, the Lord's presence, and how to reach him in this practical world, through practical action. No unnecessary sentimentalism. Practical action.

**Key Quote:** "Bhirachandra Prabhu then took the stone back to Kardaha by floating it into the Ganges, as if it was too heavy to board onto a boat."
**Summary:** This segment narrates the story of how Bhirachandra Prabhu obtained the Shaligram Shila from the Nawab's palace in Murshidabad, highlighting the miraculous transformation of food into flowers and the floating of the stone on the Ganges.

It is stated in Prema Vilasa that Sri Bhirachandra Prabhu, after having received appropriate instructions from his father, Nithyananda Prabhu, to install Sri Shamasundraji in Kardaha, had set out to obtain the Shaligram Shila from the Nawab's palace in Murshidabad, from which the deity needed to be carved. Sri Bhirachandra Prabhu's reputation preceded him, and the Nawab greeted him with full honor on his arrival. However, the Nawab had evil intentions. Sri Bhirachandra's vow of feeding him meat. Hence, the Nawab thought that feeding meat to this great Vaishnava would end up derailing him from his religious path and shall thereby spoil his reputation. However, when Nawab attempted to serve him the non-veg dishes, the food automatically got transformed into roses and jasmine. The Nawab ordered his chief to bring new items. But again, the potency of Sri Bhirachandra, the food got transformed into flowers. The Nawab got frustrated in his attempts and finally came to realize that Sri Bhirachandra Prabhu was a great devotee and no ordinary personality. Feeling remorseful and guilty, the Nawab fell at his lotus feet and begged him for forgiveness. Bhirachandra Prabhu, feeling merciful, forgave him. Bhirachandra Prabhu then informed the Nawab, "I saw you eating the food. I saw a huge stone above your front gate. I would be happy to have it so that I can carve a nice deity out of it." The Nawab was very happy to give his consent. Bhirachandra Prabhu then took the stone back to Kardaha by floating it into the Ganges, as if it was too heavy to board onto a boat. To the surprise of all, the Shaligramma stone floated down the river and ultimately reached the banks of Kardaha, where it was carefully recovered.

**Summary:** This segment describes the process of carving the deity of Lord Shamsundara from the Shaligram Shila, the rejection of the first two deities, and the grand installation festival performed by Achyutananda.

While meditating at Kunjavatika, Sri Bhirachandra had received the beautiful darshana of Sri Shamsundaraji in his heart. In his trance, he received orders from his father, Nithyananda Prabhu, to fetch the Shaligramma Silla from the Nawab's place and subsequently install Shamsundaraji here in Kardaha. This concerned Shaligramma Silla had a long history. This was the same stone on which Kamsa, the wicked maternal uncle of Sri Krishna, had murdered the six children of Devaki over 5000 years ago. Somehow the stone had landed up in the custody of the Nawab. As Bhirachandra Prabhu entered the Nawab's palace, he noticed that the stone was perspiring and understood that it was the same Shaligramma Silla that he had come looking for. Sri Bhirachandra then engaged a sculptor who fulfilled his earnest desire by carving the captivating deity of Lord Shamsundara from this Shaligramma Silla. The first two deities that were sculpted didn't match the exact form of Shri Shamsundaraji that Bhirachandra had witnessed in his meditation. Hence, he sent these first two deities to Shirampur and Saiban, where they are worshipped today as Shri Radha Vallabhji and Shri Radha Nandudulalji respectively. The third deity which manifested from the Shaligramma Silla was an exact match, and Shri Bhirachandra then proceeded to install and worship it. Indeed, the people of Kardaha forgot their distress when they saw this most attractive deity. Bhirachandra Prabhu arranged a grand festival to install the deity with great pomp and show, and so, inviting many devotees and feeding all of them sumptuously, the most merciful Achyutananda, the son of Advaitacharya, performed the abhisheka of Shri Radha Shamsundaraji.

had a purifying effect on the king. This king is King Virahambar of this place. We are in his kingdom. Be careful with any valuables you have. However, he regretted having stolen them. Indeed, he desired to meet with the acharya of the books. The next morning, Srinivasa, Narottama, and Shamananda awoke to find the chest of the books missing. They searched everywhere, but when they failed to find any clue to the books' whereabouts, they felt so depressed that they considered killing themselves. Some local villagers saw the distressed condition of the three Vaishnavas and immediately suspected the robber king Veerahambira. Srinivasa made some further investigations and was assured that he would be able to find more information about the king himself. The three Vaishnavas felt some hope and abandoned their suicidal intentions. Srinivasa Acharya decided to remain in Vishnupura in the hope of finding the books, but he sent Narottama to Keturi and Shamananda to Orissa. While staying in Vishnupura, Srinivasa heard from a Brahmin named Krishna Vallabha that Veerahambira liked to listen to Srimad Bhagavatam and daily attended classes. On the next day, Srinivasa went with his Brahmin to the hall where the Bhagavata classes were held. The Brahmin introduced Srinivasa to the king as a great Vaishnava, and the king indeed observed the characteristics of the Brahmin. The king expressed a desire to hear Srinivasa speak on the Bhagavata, and Srinivasa agreed, thinking that this might be a good opportunity to recover the books. So he started to give

Srinivasa's acharyas primarily preached Bahan Prabhu's Dharma through speaking on the Bhagavata and Kirtan, while Narottama and Shamananda primarily used the medium of Kirtan. The styles of Kirtan that these three acharyas used were named Manohara Sahi, Garana Hati, and Reneti. ViraHambira arranged for a secluded dwelling to be given to Srinivasa Acharya. One day, when he had the opportunity to find the king alone in his apartment, Srinivasa recounted the entire story of the journey from Raja and the theft of the manuscripts. The king immediately confessed, showing great sorrow for his misdeed, and had the chest of books returned to its owner. In great relief, Srinivasa immediately sent messengers to Vrindavan, Narottama, and Shamananda with the good news. In the course of time, Veerahambira and his entire entourage all took initiation from Srinivasa and dedicated their entire lives and wealth to him.

**Summary:** This segment describes Govinda Kaviraj's birth, family, and early devotion to Goddess Durga.

Govinda Kaviraj, Shri Govinda Kaviraj, the brother of Ramachandra Kaviraj, was a great poet who subsequently surrendered his life at the lotus feet of Shri Radha and Krishna. At the time of Govinda's birth, Sunanda Devi suffered from intense labor pain. Damodara Sen was a devotee of Goddess Durga. When Damodara Sen learned about his daughter's predicament, he prayed to Durga Devi. He fed Sunanda the water from Durga Yantra. Soon, Sunanda gave birth to a beautiful child who was later named Govinda. A few years after Govinda was born, his father Chiranjeeva passed away. Being raised at his maternal father's home at Shrikanta, Govinda was brought up amidst Saktas or devotees of Maa Durga. As compared to his brother Ramachandra, who was a Krishna Bhakta, Govinda since his childhood was a worshipper of Bhagavati Devi, Goddess Durga. After Sunanda Devi passed away, both Ramachandra and Govinda shifted to Kumar Nagar. It was here at Kumar Nagara that Ramachandra Kaviraj got married to Ratnamala Devi and subsequently surrendered himself to Srinivasa Acharya. Soon afterwards, Ramachandra and Govinda decided to shift to the...

**Summary:** This segment narrates the relocation to Talia Budhari, Ramachandra's desire for association with Srinivasa Acharya, and the incident where Durga acknowledges Krishna's supremacy through the lotus offering.

peaceful and blissful village of Talia Budhari near Bhagavangola. So Bhagavangola was not the birthplace of Ramachandra Kaviraj. This was the place they stayed most, where they already had some land. Ramachandra insisted on shifting to Telia Bandhura because he felt that over here he would receive more association with Srinivasa Acharya and would have to pass over Telia Budhari to reach to Sripata of Narottam Das at Rajshahi. As presented before, Ramachandra and Narottama subsequently became the best friends and could hardly tolerate separation from each other. It is mentioned in Bhakti Ratnakara: Talia Budhari Grame A Govindera Stiti... by Nirjana Sthaneti Prita Aati... Budhari Paschime Sri Paschima Paranama... Tata Sarva Rambhe Bhas Seho Ramya Sthana. Devi Durga honors the offered lotus flowers in her hand. Adjacent to the residence of Govinda Kaviraj at Talia Budhari existed two ponds, which were commonly known as Jodha Pukura, pair of ponds. Innumerable lotuses adorned these ponds. I don't know whether you noticed yesterday there was a small pond with lotus. Flower was not there but leaves were there. So once, while Ramachandra Kaviraj was passing by these ponds, he was enthralled to note its beauty. In his mind, he then offered a couple of lotus flowers unto Lord Govinda, his worshipable Ishta Deva. Who are the deities in Bhagwan Gola? So later, when Govinda Kaviraj plucked these same lotus flowers and offered them unto his worshipable Devi Durga, as he did every day, he was shocked to discover that Maa Durga was holding these lotus flowers in her hands, instead of them lying at her feet. So the lotus flower was offered at the feet, but she offered it to the Lord and it was held in her hand. He understood, later he understood that Lord Krishna is the worshipable master of Maa Durga.

**Summary:** This segment details Govinda's illness, his prayer to Durga, and Durga's instruction to meditate on Krishna's lotus feet for liberation.

And hence, anything offered to Krishna is sacred to all, including the goddess. One day, while Srinivasa and Ramachandra were sitting together, a messenger arrived carrying a letter from Govinda Kaviraj. In that letter, Govinda expressed that he was critically ill and requested his brother, Ramachandra, to come and see him at Telliya Budhari. Ramachandra did not want to take leave from his spiritual master and so he hid the letter. A few days later, Govinda wrote a second letter, expressing that his health has deteriorated further and wished to see Ramachandra and Srinivasa Charya. Actually, Govinda was a staunch devotee of Goddess Durga and he prayed to the Goddess for his mercy. It is said that he had reached a perfectional stage in his worship of Goddess and had even seen her face to face. So when Govinda asked for liberation from her and requested her to bestow her mercy so that he could cross over the ocean of birth and death, the Goddess instructed him to meditate upon the lotus feet of Lord Krishna instantly. If he wished to be delivered, the Goddess revealed that she herself meditates upon and worships the reddish feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Krishna alone can deliver one from the clutches of material birth and death. Maa Durga added that there are hundreds of Durgas, Sivas and Brahmas who are constantly engaged in offering prayers and singing the glories of Lord Krishna. But they are yet to reach the end of Supreme Lord's unlimited glories. Only fools refuse to surrender unto Krishna...

Shinivasa Acharya happily agreed and blessed him. Govinda Kaviraj's poems are so powerful and so intense that many addressed him as the second Vidyapati. On the request of King Govinda Hari Narayan, he composed a beautiful book dedicated to his brother Ramachandra. The book was called Shri Rama Charita Gita. On the request of King Santoshadatta, the ruler of Keturi, Govinda composed a play known as Sangeetha Madhava Nataka.

On realizing that Krishna was indeed his worshipable Supreme Lord, Brahma felt very ashamed. As atonement, he arrived at present-day Mayapur and began meditating upon the blissful form of Gaurahari, Lord Chaitanya, who is none other than Lord Krishna, and became very pleased and knowing the desire of Brahma granted him the boon that he would become an intimate associate of the Lord when he would next appear in this material world.

According to the revealed scriptures, Srila Haridas Thakur was born in the village of Buron, which is presently situated in the Kulna district of Bangladesh. However, no trace of this residence exists today at this place. Is it still called Buron? Hiraganj. But when we went there, it was surprising that nobody would believe that he is born in a Muslim family. They say he is a Hindu, his father's name is this, his mother's name is this, but just that he was very closely associating with Muslims because the whole area was only Mohammedan. So it's both sides people talk. But according to our acharyas and scriptures, he is born Muslim.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates a story of Haridasa Thakura experiencing ecstasy while watching a snake charmer perform and sing about Krishna's pastimes.

It is right across the stream. This is the southernmost part we would be in Bangladesh. After this, we would move northwards. In fact, your mobile phone will show home time. This is not the exact time, right? It shows 4.15, but it's actually 4.45, because mobile phone thinks you are back in India. Many pastimes were there, of Haridas Thakur, miraculous pastimes, small, different places. There is one mentioned here in Chaitanya. There's a story of Haridas Thakur, a snake charmer and a snake. One day, in the courtyard of a rich man's house, a snake charmer was performing a snake dance. He was chanting a special mantra accompanied by musicians playing the Mridanga and Manjira. Haridas was passing by and stood to one side watching the snake dance. Although the snake charmer was an ordinary human being, by the influence of his mantra he could dance as though the spirit of the king of the snakes Ananta Sesha possessed him. With an enchanting melody he sang about the pastime of Lord Krishna in the lake called Kaliadaha where the Lord had vanquished an evil serpent called Kalia. Haridasa listened intently to the pastime of his beloved Lord Krishna and he suddenly moved by ecstasy he fell unconscious to the ground when he regained consciousness. He jumped to his feet and rode like a lion, dancing in ecstasy as he babbled with joy. The snake charmer was impressed by the manifestation of ecstatic symptoms in Haridas Thakur's body and stood respectful to the sight. As the various symptoms of horripilation, crying and shivering traversed Haridas' body, he rolled in the dust, crying in love for Krishna. He remembered how his beloved Lord had mercifully saved the snake Kalia and as he floated in ecstatic trance, the people around him obliged by singing songs about the wonderful pastimes of the Lord. The snake charmer simply stood to the sight, overcome by awe and reverence for Haridas.

**Key Quote:** "By seeing Srila Haridas Thakura dance, one becomes liberated from material bondage."
**Summary:** The story continues with a Brahmana attempting to imitate Haridasa's ecstasy for recognition, but is punished by the snake charmer, who then explains the true nature and glories of Haridasa Thakura.

When his ecstasy subsided, Haridas left and the snake charmer resumed his performance. Everyone who witnessed the ecstasy of Haridas felt spiritually accelerated and they smeared their bodies with dust from his feet. However, one cunning and insightful Brahmana in the crowd decided to cheat the people. He also started dancing. He told himself, I can see that the people are not very intelligent. They are offering so much respect to this low-born Haridas, just because he dances and cries. If I, a Brahmana, also dance and cry, then they will certainly worship me as well. The Brahmana threw himself on the ground and feigned unconsciousness as though he had fallen into trance. However, as soon as he touched the ground, the dancing snake charmer became furious, picked up a stick and began beating the Brahmana relentlessly. He struck him repeatedly. He hit him on every part of his body until the Brahmana, howling in agony, got up and ran away just to save his life. The snake charmer then resumed his dance while the entire crowd stood dumbfounded. At last, a man with folded hands humbly requested the snake charmer to explain why he had stood respectfully to the side while Haridas danced, yet he had beaten the Brahmana for what seemed to be the same activity. The spirit of Ananda Sesha, who dwelt within the snake charmer, then spoke in glorification of Srila Das Thakura. The subject matter of your inquiry is very confidential. Although such a topic is rarely discussed, because of its highly esoteric nature, I shall nevertheless answer your question. When Srila Das Thakura was dancing in ecstatic trance, each one of us felt it. Our respect and affection for him spontaneously increased. However, the deceitful Brahmana was simply imitating Haridasa in order to get some cheap adoration from the crowd, not out of love for Krishna, but out of enviousness towards a pure devotee. The Brahmana threw himself on the ground in ecstasy. Furthermore, he interrupted by dancing. Since he disturbed me and tried to imitate the pure devotee, I punished him severely. This arrogant and deceitful Brahmana has no love for Krishna. To receive the shelter of devotional service at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, one has to become pure, free from deceit. By seeing Srila Haridas Thakura dance, one becomes liberated from material bondage. Even the Supreme Lord Krishna himself dances when he sees Srila Dasa Thakura dance. The entire universe becomes cleansed of all sinful reactions just by seeing Srila Haridas dance.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes Haridasa Thakura's humility and explains that his birth in a low-caste family demonstrates the futility of material designations and the importance of devotion.

He is truly worthy of his name, Haridasa Thakura, the servant of the Supreme Lord, Hare Krishna, who shines eternally like a full moon in the heart of his devotees. Haridasa is affectionate and compassionate towards all living entities, and he descends as the eternal servant of the Supreme Lord in each of the Lord's incarnations. He is free from any fault or offense towards the Supreme Lord or his devotees. Even in his dreams, he never commits an offense. A moment's association with Haridasa can purify any living entity and assure him the eternal shelter of Lord Krishna's lotus feet. Even Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva constantly desire his association. Haridas appeared in the family of a lowly Muslim on the order of the Supreme Lord, just to teach human society that material designations like caste, creed, birth, status and family positions are all illusory and pursuing them is futile. A pure devotee of the Lord is born in a low-class family. He is no less worthy of worship. This is injunction of the scriptures.

On the other hand, if someone is born in a sophisticated family but does not worship the lotus feet of Sri Krishna, then his high birth is useless, for he lives just like a resident of hell. Just to prove the truth of these scriptures, Srila Haridas took birth in a low-caste family. Prahlad Maharaj, one of the greatest devotees of the Lord, had previously appeared in a family of demons. And Hanuman, the greatest devotee of Lord Ramachandra, took birth in the monkey species. The demigods desired the touch of the pure and transcendental form of Srila Haridas Thakura. And Ganga Mata also prays that her water will be sanctified by his presence. However, one need not touch Srila Das Thakura. By seeing him, simply by seeing him, one is automatically freed from the eternal cycle of birth and death. Furthermore, one who sees a devotee who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Haridas Thakura is also granted freedom from material bondage. Neither a thousand mouths nor a thousand ears would be sufficient to describe and hear the wonderful qualities of Srila Haridas Thakura. You are a fortunate soul, for your inquiry has given me an opportunity to glorify the pure devotee and has given you the opportunity to hear the transcendental topic. From the moment a person speaks the name Srila Haridas Thakura, his ascension to the supreme abode of Lord Krishna is guaranteed.

Balaram Acharya was the family priest of Hiranya and Govardhana Majumda. Due to receiving his favour, Balaram Acharya was very attached to Haridas Thakur, and thus, he provided all his needs with great care and attention. Haridas Thakur was given a cottage in a secluded place and he came daily to Balaram Acharya's house to accept prasad. At that time, Raghunath Das was a schoolboy and he used to come and see Haridas Thakur every day. Naturally, Haridas Thakur was very merciful towards him, and as a result, Raghunath Das later on attained to his love. Haridas Thakur was immediately sheltered at the lotus feet of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Regular discourses were held at the residence of Hiranya and Govardhana. One day, Balaram Acharya very humbly invited Haridas Thakur to come there. Upon seeing Haridas Thakur arrive, the two Majumdaras immediately stood up and then fell at his lotus feet to offer obeisances. There were many learned scholars, brahmanas and respectable gentlemen in that assembly, and Hiranya and Govardhana were also greatly learned. As the two brothers very respectfully offered Haridas Thakur a sitting place, everyone began to speak about his exalted qualities as if they each possessed five mouths. Hiranya and Govardhana were very pleased to hear this talk. When it was mentioned how Haridas Thakur chanted 300,000 holy names daily, the learned scholars began to discuss the glories of the holy name of the Lord. Some of them said, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one is freed from all reactions to sinful activities. Others said, simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one becomes liberated from material bondage. Haridas Thakur protested. These two benedictions are not the true result of chanting the holy name of the Lord. If one actually chants the holy name without offences, his ecstatic love for the lotus feet of Lord Krishna is awakened.

**Key Quote:** "Liberation is thus the insignificant result derived from a mere glimpse of awakening of offenceless chanting."
**Summary:** Haridas Thakur explains the meaning of a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing that liberation is a byproduct of chanting the holy name without offenses, and that pure devotees desire ecstatic love for Krishna, not liberation.

In Srimad Bhagavatam, it is said, when a person is actually advanced and takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord, who is very dear to him, he becomes agitated, and thus sometimes laughs, sometimes cries, and sometimes chants loudly and dances without caring for outsiders. Liberation and the destruction of sinful reactions are two concomitant byproducts of chanting the holy name of the Lord. As the rising sun immediately dissipates all the world's darkness, so the holy name of the Lord, even if chanted only once without offences, dispels all of one's sinful reactions. Haridas Thakur questioned, O learned scholars, please explain the meaning of this verse. However, the audience responded, it would be better if you explain the meaning of this important verse. Haridas Thakur said, even before the sun rises in the morning, it dissipates the darkness of night with its dawning light, and thus all fear of thieves and ghosts immediately vanishes. Then, when the sun actually becomes visible, everything is clearly manifest and people begin performing their morning religious activities and other duties. Similarly, the first glimpse of offenceless chanting of the Lord's holy name immediately dissipates all reactions to sinful life. Then, when one is actually on the platform of offenceless chanting, there awakens a static loving devotional service to the lotus feet of Krishna. Liberation is thus the insignificant result derived from a mere glimpse of awakening of offenceless chanting. An example of such an effect of Nama Bhasa is seen in the life of Ajamila. Liberation, which is unacceptable to a pure devotee, is very easily offered by Lord Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "One cannot understand the glories of the holy name of the Lord simply by mundane logic and argument."
**Summary:** The story continues with Gopal Chakravarti criticizing Haridas Thakur's statements about liberation through chanting, leading to a challenge and eventual dismissal from service.

There was a person named Gopal Chakravarti staying at Hiranya and Govardhana's house. He was the chief tax collector, and it was his duty to collect 12 lakh coins and deposit them in the emperor's treasury. This caste brahmana had very handsome bodily features, and he was very learned and youthful. However, he could not tolerate hearing the statement that one can achieve liberation by glimpsing the awakening of pure chanting of the Lord's holy name. Becoming very angry, Gopal Chakravarti began criticizing Haridas Thakur as follows. O learned scholars, just hear the conclusion of this emotional devotee. After many millions of births, when one becomes complete in transcendental knowledge, one may still not attain liberation. Yet, this man says that it can be obtained simply by awakening a glimpse of the holy name of the Lord. Haridas Thakur replied, Why are you doubtful? Shastra clearly states that one can attain liberation simply by a slight glimpse of offenseless chanting. For the devotee who enjoys the transcendental bliss of devotional service, liberation is most insignificant, like the water containing within the hoof print of a calf. Gopal Chakravarti said, If one is not liberated by such namabasa chanting, then I shall certainly cut off your nose. Haridas Thakur accepted this challenge by saying, If by namabasa liberation is not available, then I shall certainly cut off my own nose. After hearing Gopal Chakravarti's challenge, everyone gathered there became very agitated, and while getting up from their seats, they made a tumultuous noise. Hiranya and Govardhana immediately went and began chastising Gopal Chakravarti, and Balram Acharya told him, You are a foolish logician. What do you know about the devotional service of the Lord? Since you have insulted Haridas Thakur, you have put yourself in a very dangerous position and so you should not expect anything auspicious. The two Majumdaras immediately dismissed Gopal Chakravarti from their service. Then, as Haridas Thakur got up to leave, they went along with the other members of the assembly and fell at his lotus feet. While smiling, Haridas Thakur spoke to them as follows in a very sweet voice, None of you are at fault. Indeed, even this ignorant so-called brahmana is not to be blamed, for he is accustomed to dry speculation and logic. One cannot understand the glories of the holy name of the Lord simply by mundane logic and argument.

**Summary:** The story concludes with Gopal Chakravarti contracting leprosy as a consequence of his offense to Haridas Thakur, highlighting the devotee's forgiveness and the Lord's intolerance of blasphemy towards his devotees.

Now, all of you please return home and do not be sorry that I have been insulted. May Lord Krishna bestow his blessings upon you all. After returning home, Hiranya and Govardhana ordered that Gopal Chakravarti never again be admitted into their house. Within three days, Gopal Chakravarti was attacked by a leprosy, and as a result, his highly raised nose melted away and fell off. Although his toes and fingers were as beautiful as golden champaka buds, they gradually withered away, and upon seeing Gopal Chakravarti's condition, everyone became highly astonished. While considering the wonderful influence of Haridas Thakur, everyone glorified him and offered him obeisances. Although Haridas Thakur did not take the brahmana's offences seriously, the Supreme Personality of God could not tolerate it and thus arranged for him to suffer the consequences. It is a characteristic of a pure devotee that he excuses any offences committed by an ignorant rascal. However, the characteristics of Lord Krishna is that he cannot tolerate blasphemy of his devotees. Haridas Thakur was unhappy to hear about how Gopal Chakravarti had been attacked by leprosy. After informing Balram Acharya, Haridas Thakur went to Advaita Acharya's house at Shantipur.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of being qualified to associate with pure devotees and maintaining appropriate relationships with senior, equal, and junior devotees.

Shri Haridas Thakur Ki! So, this is the glory of great devotees like Haridas Thakur. Great devotees are like razor blades. They can save your life by a good surgery, but if we are not careful, we can get cut. So, it is said that we always, first before praying for the association of pure devotees, we first pray that we are qualified to associate with the pure devotees. If we are qualified to associate with pure devotees, then we can act in an appropriate way in front of a pure devotee. So, what does it speak of dealing with the Supreme Lord? So, this material life, Sadhu Sanga, is so important that we learn how we associate with devotees of three different stages, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said: devotees who are senior to us, devotees who are equal to us, and devotees who are junior to us. So, to all three levels, we need to have an appropriate relationship, a right way of dealing. We don't consider ourselves superior to the inferiors. Rather, we show mercy and teach them. To equals, we be very friendly, and together we serve the Supreme Lord. And towards the seniors, we humbly serve them.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the importance of devotee association, avoiding offenses, and looking beyond the external appearances of Vaishnavas.

It doesn't matter who is leading, because going towards Krishna is more important. Whether we are leading or we are led, it really doesn't matter. So, whenever there is this situation of seniors, juniors and equals, we need a situation to deal with that. So, that is why Srila Prabhupada created this house full of devotees, different levels of devotees, devotees from different areas, different from all over the world. So, we may be knowingly or unknowingly committing so many offences. So, every morning we say, devotees don't take the offence directly. But when devotees are offended, the Lord, even though He does not take offence to Him seriously, He will take the offence to His devotees seriously. So, we know the story of Ambarisha Maharaj. The story is here. Haridas Thakur, lowly born or highly born, educated, not educated, beautiful, ugly, black, white, doesn't matter. So, we need to pray to the Supreme Lord and the devotees to go past the externals of Ambarisha. One has to cross, looking at the Vaishnavas materially. So, great lesson by the life of Haridas Thakur.

We are very fortunate to be here. It is said that if you chant Haridas Thakur's name, your liberation is guaranteed. So, what to speak of being in Haridas Thakur's birthplace, being in the bhajanskali of Haridas Thakur, and that too the association of Vaishnavas. So, this is a great, great opportunity. We cannot forget the basic foundational teachings of devotional service. So, Dham Seva is very important, just like Nama Seva, Murti Seva, Vaishnava Seva, Bhagavata Seva, Dham Seva. So, one has to, in the middle of many services and important roles we play in different places, it is always good to take some time off to visit Dhams with Vaishnavas. We can alone go two weeks, go around and come, but those two weeks, if we spend with Vaishnavas, the whole experience is totally different. So, we are coming here for Dham Seva. Not only Dham Seva, along with that Vaishnava Seva, and the greatest of Vaishnavas, Haridas Thakur.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of Diksha, explaining its components (Divya Gyan and Papakshaya) and its importance in the process of liberation and reviving Krishna Consciousness within the Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Parampara.

Hare Krishna and welcome to all the candidates for the first and the second initiation ceremony. As per the system given by Srila Prabhupada, as per his last wish, Diksha, how many are first initiation here? First initiation, right. So, Diksha, you may know already, comes from two words, sounds, Di and Ksha. Di represents Divya Gyan. And Ksha is Papakshaya. Two things which is primarily needed for returning home back to Krishna. All of you know that we are in a place which is unsuitable for us. Us meaning the spirit soul, not as the body, not as the mind, or not as the ego, what we have assumed. So, this is not the place for the living entities to be in, because he should be with Krishna. He should be associating with Krishna and his paraphernalia. But unfortunately, we are here in this material world. And the process of liberation has already started by us coming in touch with this Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Parampara.

**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the difference between theoretical knowledge (Gyan) and realized knowledge (Vijnana), emphasizing the need to move beyond superficial understanding and practice Krishna Consciousness to overcome Karma and engage in constitutional activities.

The most sacred, live, vibrant, practising Parampara in the Vaishnava system. So, having come here, this is an opportunity for us to revive the Krishna Consciousness, which is as a Swaroopa of the spirit soul. So, to go back to our original position, the two most important aspect is the Gyan, Divya Gyan. Knowledge about our original position. Gyan does not mean just material or theoretical understanding, superficial understanding. All of us know Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All of us have heard, we are not the body. All of us know we have to go back to him, but we are not able to go back to him. So, knowledge is there, but the Vijnana, the realised knowledge. Realising the knowledge by practice. Making the knowledge a reality. That is Divya Gyan. Realised knowledge. Ten Brahma Hridayat, like Brahma, realised. So, this realisation happens in the heart, not in the memory. So, this Divya Gyan is one of the components required to go back to the original position. But for that, the stopping, what is stopping us is the Karma, which is due to Papa. So, this building up of this Papa is there, which is stopping us from knowing the Jnana, which is stopping us from performing the original constitutional activities. Now, we are performing conditional activities. Those activities which we are made to do in this condition. Sometimes we are in human condition, we do human activities. We are in animal condition, you do animal activities. So, these are conditional activities. Even the activities we may do in Varna and Ashram are also conditional activities. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, Abramacharis, Sanyasis, these are all conditional. Constitutional activity, Nitya Seva. The constitutional activity is Krishna Consciousness. Krishna Consciousness, Bhakti, performance of devotional service to the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how Diksha helps in developing Divya Gyan and burning Papa (sins) through the grace of the spiritual master, emphasizing the importance of surrender (Saranagati) and determination as prerequisites for Diksha.

So, that is the constitutional activity of the soul. And what is stopping that is our conditional situation, which is due to Papa. The covering of the soul, build up covering, subtle covering and the gross covering. So, by the process of proper Diksha, one is supposed to develop Divya Gyan, one is able to burn his Papa, all by the grace of the spiritual master, who is at the lotus feet of Krishna. So, taking shelter of such a spiritual master, taking shelter of this Acharya, who is dear to Krishna, who has come to us by good fortune and by the mercy of this personality. So, that is the opportunity we have in this decision you all have made by taking this determination. So, Diksha is a beginning process. It is not an end process. By Diksha, one gets opportunity for this purification. Yes, there are certain qualifications, qualifications needed. Some qualification needed to get Diksha. Just like if you want to be a doctor, you should have a pre-university degree. With your SSLC or a matriculation, you cannot enter a MBBS college. So, there is a pre-requirement of getting something to get into this college. So, this is like an admission, which guarantees that you will become a doctor. But by admission, you don't become a doctor. Similarly, by Diksha, you don't become pure. It is a pre-requisite to become pure. And for Diksha, there are also pre-requirements. So, having qualified for Diksha, which is what? Qualification of Diksha is the determination. Determination to follow. Determination to serve. Determination to give up. Determination to surrender.

**Key Quote:** "Unless he considers himself as a devotee of my devotee. That is the process. That is the principle."
**Summary:** This segment delves deeper into the concept of Saranagati (full surrender), highlighting the need to give up personal requirements and dedicate oneself to satisfying the spiritual master's wishes, emphasizing that spiritual knowledge is under the control of a personality (Krishna) unlike material knowledge which is system-based.

Saranagati. So, then what is Saranagati? Full surrender. Irrespective of any personal needs, personal requirements, care for person. So, a devotee who is taking Diksha, who is desiring to go back to Godhead, who is desiring to serve the spiritual master, has to first understand that he is ready to give up his own requirements. Unless we are ready to give up our own requirements, we cannot surrender 100% to the spiritual master and 100% dedicate our life to satisfy his wishes. Why? Because the Supreme Lord has wished that anybody who comes back to him should come through his pure devotees. As Krishna has explained in Adi Purana, anybody who considers himself as my devotee, I don't consider him as a devotee, unless he considers himself as a devotee of my devotee. That is the process. That is the principle. So, to satisfy the devotee of the Supreme Lord, one surrenders to him. And it's a very personal philosophy. This is not a mechanical philosophy that okay, I studied five years in engineering college, I have to get a certificate if I pass. I have gone through five years of doctorate, I have to become doctorate. I have done my research, I have to get. But here I have done everything, read Bhagavatam ten thousand times, I may not get Krishna. That is the difference. Material knowledge and spiritual knowledge, because spiritual knowledge is under the control of a personality.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the impersonal nature of material knowledge with the personal connection required in the spiritual system, emphasizing that pleasing the servant of Krishna through genuine surrender of mind, words, and actions is essential for attaining Krishna.

Material knowledge is a control of a system. You go through the system, it doesn't matter who you are. You are able to vomit everything that is in the book, you will get. But here, vomiting won't help. Here, proper personal connection with Krishna. You have a connection with professor or a dean, doesn't matter. He may say yes sir, and behind him he will say so many other things. It doesn't matter. It's not a personal connection. Even though in many of the tradition knowledge, personal connection is important. You take any of those Vaidika knowledge, Natya Shastra, or any of those things also, the blessing of the teacher, blessing of the guru, this is a system in the Vedic system, not in the modern system. But spiritual system is totally different. In spiritual system, one cannot get Krishna without pleasing the servant of Krishna. Now pleasing the servant of Krishna does not mean simply shaking your head in front of him. Yes, yes, yes. It is not a tongue service. It is a service. It is surrender of one's heart. So one has to Manasa Vacha Karvana, by one's mind, by one's words, and by one's action, have to surrender to the personality and not only surrender up to the personality, make sure that the personality is satisfied. That is a requirement to get Krishna. So there is a system, but there is a very, very deep personal connection. That personal connection makes us qualified

**Summary:** This segment discusses Krishna's independent will and how He is only attainable through His grace, emphasizing the need to accept Krishna as a 'transcendental autocrat' and highlighting the spiritual master's blessing as armor in the fight against Maya.

to be accepted by Krishna. As Prabhupada quotes from Upanishad, many times, what is that verse? Naaham Naaham labhyo pravachanena labhya Naayam atma pravachanena labhya Na medhaya bahudha suthena. I am not available. Even if you are a great intelligent person, you are a great orator, you are a great Vedic person, I am available only if I allow you to be. No? I allow myself to be available to you. So this is Krishna's demand. So he is called transcendental autocrat. And we are all against autocrats in this material world, right? Nobody likes autocrat. Everybody blames you, he is an autocrat. Krishna is an autocrat. Can you accept that? Yes. If we can accept Krishna is autocrat, and his wish goes, nothing but his wish, then we are ready. So this is a preparation to get that consciousness. Deeksha is a preparation to get that consciousness. Deeksha allows us to get that consciousness. Why? Because once we have the blessing of the spiritual master, then we are not fighting alone. The world is like a fight. Fighting against maya, fighting against the current. So if you are alone, it's difficult. We need to have equipments. We have to be properly armed when we are fighting, right? The same way, the arm, the armor, that's the blessing of the spiritual master.

**Summary:** Using the analogy of a girl wanting to marry a person but disliking his family, the speaker emphasizes the need to accept Krishna and His entire paraphernalia, highlighting surrender as accepting Krishna's interests and Diksha as the beginning of this learning process.

So a military kivgamesh said this last time, in the holy name of the Lord, the bhagavata, person bhagavata, and the philosophy bhagavatata, we are entering a very very personal arena, just like a girl wants to marry a person. I like you, I want to marry you. But I don't like your mother, I don't like your father, I don't like a dog, I don't like your house, I don't like. Impossible. he has to get out. But you cannot go to Krishna saying, Krishna, I like you but nothing around you. That is not possible. They're accepting the whole. We are not accepting one person because Krishna is that whole. You cannot say, I'll take Krishna but I don't like this, I don't like that. No. Block, stock and barrel you have to accept. So one has to understand that one is entering the whole. We are separated like the spark is separated from the fire. So today we are separated. Now we have to get into the whole which means Krishna and his paraphernalia. Krishna, his devotees, his places, his paraphernalia, his philosophy, his desires, his interest. We are part of him. Now we are disconnected so we think, I mean this is different Krishna's interest is different. So as part of surrender, one of the principal elements of surrender is to accept the interest of Krishna and keep our interest aside. There are six aspects of surrender. So keeping Krishna's interests. So this learning process starts with diksha. It's not an

world this ocean of material world so that begins with Diksha this qualifies us to be ready to go back to Krishna and gives us all that we lack not that he gives everything and we don't have to do anything no God helps those who help themselves some way same way the spiritual master helps those who help themselves how is that when we are dedicated when we are proactively dedicated and serving him then the strength to do that comes so this way the devotees the disciples are taken back to Krishna by the spiritual master to engage in our original position so it's a very very serious business now now I am very free in my life and I am ready to take Diksha no it's not a free time work it's a full-time work so we have to make sure that we give our time we give our energy these are the two things we can surrender to Krishna what does we have we have our time and we have our energy so brahmachari is in the temple give their time and their energy for the cause of the ashram which is the house of the spiritual master and there are the grahastha who stay outside the temple but they also give their time and energy whatever is left after taking care of their first duty so they have

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the duties of Grihasthas, emphasizing the importance of proportionately dedicating their earnings and time to the spiritual master's cause, highlighting that true surrender is measured by the quantum of time and energy spent for the absolute cause, and Diksha is the beginning of this journey.

the license to take care of the first duty brahmachari is in the temple automatically they go back to godhead what about the me sitting in my house you also have the opportunity to go back to godhead by the same process the people living in the temple so doesn't matter whether one is staying in the temple or staying outside the temple both have the to go back to Godhead by following the process but one has to surrender, be ready to give his time and give his energy. So Grihasthas they earn money, they spend their time in earning money and they earn money whether it's an employment, whether it's a business and they have the duty for their ashram, the Grihastha ashram duties which includes immediate requirement, which includes emergency requirement. And he parts proportionately to his surrender the balance to the spiritual master's cause. That is a surrender and he keeps aside time enough to serve the spiritual master. So giving one's time and giving one's energy is a symptom of surrender, not taking Diksha, change name or you have a white thread that doesn't make us qualified as a qualified surrendered soul. What makes us qualified surrendered soul is what quantum of time and energy we spend for the absolute cause. So that all that begins with Diksha. And a person taking Diksha is determined to do these things. If anybody wants to think twice, this is the right time. When you go to war, they all assemble and say anybody who wants to come out of this war, this is the right time to decide. So same way, this is the right time to decide.

**Key Quote:** "What is intelligent is understanding that I am in an unnecessary business and enter the real business, which gives real bliss, real happiness, real connection with our relations."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing that taking Diksha is the most intelligent decision because it leads one from the 'drainage' of material life to the 'main road' of spiritual life, offering real bliss, happiness, and connection with Krishna and His devotees, contrasting it with the temporary and ultimately unsatisfying pursuits of the material world.

deities, we take a pledge to dedicate. But according to Prabhupada, this is the most intelligent decision one takes. The most intelligent decision. Why? When you come to know that I am walking through the drain and somebody says, this is drain, dirty place. You are walking through, this is the road. Having come to know the dirty road, he gets into the proper path. So now we are driving on the main road. Till now we were driving on the drainage. Most intelligent person. Why? He doesn't work like a donkey in this material world for material causes. So one has to balance his life, his material requirements and keep spiritual requirement as a priority and step by step, if you follow this process, Gropa is already guaranteed as shelter of Krishna. Why all these things? To get the ultimate shelter which gives us Satchitananda, the state of eternity, the state of shelter and permanent bliss, not material bliss, not temporary bliss. Permanent happiness. So if you want to experience the happiness of the soul, Atma Ramaha, self-sufficiently blissful soul, satisfied in himself, in service of the Supreme Lord. So that is the position we are trying to get. That is why it is called intelligent. Rather than in this material world, somehow or the other trying to get happy, despite of all the difficulties, crossed difficulties, and after all these things, the man thinks, he's a hero. I've made it in this material world. That is where Gropa says, this is like a camel chewing the thorn. Finally, he's only testing his blood. Same way the man who says he's successful in the material world is only testing his own blood without knowing. That is not intelligent. What is intelligent is understanding that I am in an unnecessary business and enter the real business, which gives real bliss, real happiness, real connection with our relations. All the relations in this material world, by the way, happen so. But the real relationship is with Krishna and the pure devotees. And that begins with diksha. Hence, it is called the most right decision. It is called the most intelligent decision. So thank you very much for taking this decision. So we will continue with the other process. Anybody has any questions? Anybody wants to go outside, talk to the wife and date, decide

These are the work of the great preachers, like we said in the morning, the first set of preachers after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, three people, three personalities: Srinivas Acharya, Narottam Das Thakur, and Shyamananda Prabhu. These were the first three preachers with the Shakti of Gauranga. All of them were very sad that they were born just after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, they couldn't see Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, so they were the Shakti of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to initiate the preaching. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did a lot of preaching, but real organized preaching was done by these three personalities.

So that is how we covered Shyamananda Prabhu's place. This is another extension of Shyamananda Prabhu's place, Rishikananda, his own disciple. And then tomorrow, of course, we are in Bhaura-Hugli area, all the different small, small temples. Then we'll be going to Vishnupur, which is Srinivas Acharya's place. Then as we go towards the border of Bangladesh, we'll see Narottam Das Thakur's place. So we are basically seeing the three main preachers, their places are what is coming in this circuit. So many stories connected to these three personalities. They were sent by Jeeva Goswami to bring all the books of the Goswamis. All the Rupa Goswamis, Sanatan Goswami, all their books were brought, you know the story, on a big bullock cart the books were brought and it was stolen. So we'll be going day after tomorrow to the dacoit king's city called Vishnupur, very beautiful place. That is Srinivas Acharya.

Shyamananda did north Bengal, Srinivas Acharya did Bangladesh, Narottam Das Thakur, Srinivas Acharya went all the way to Tripura and also Manipur. So this whole place was actually preached, organized way, by these personalities.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the tradition of deity installation, highlighting Narottam Das Thakur's role and contrasting how deities were received in the past versus the present.

And that is a footstep we are also following, the organized preaching form. The first temple was built by Narottam Das Thakur. The first Gopunima was done by him in Keturi ground. We'll see that, where Janava Mata himself, herself, and Nithyananda Prabhu's wife, she was present. So today also that is the same system we follow: go to your place, take a place, put, have the deities installed and start preaching. So this system is not something new, it is going on from Narottam Das Thakur's time onwards. They all went, installed duties, but the difference is that these personalities got deities and they dream, they got deities from Radharani. We have to make deities and then install them as Kali Yuga goes on.

Now the strength of the preachers are going down, but there's Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Shakti, so with all our weaknesses, He is making us to preach, continue preaching this message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. But these preachers were Shakti away by themselves, Shyamananda, Narottam, Srinivas. So Shyamananda Prabhu, as we read a little bit in the previous temple, same line as Nithyananda. So we are also Nithyananda, coming down from Janava Mata and Narottam Das Thakur, Vishwanath Chakravarti. So this is our line. However, as far as these are concerned, they are a little different, even though they are from Nithyananda Prabhu's Vamsha because of the tilak mark, right? There's a little different, but basically...

**Summary:** The speaker recounts the controversy surrounding Shyamananda Prabhu's tilak and how it was resolved, emphasizing the roles of Hridayachaitanya and Jiva Goswami.

we have the same parampara. So there was a controversy long time back in Mindavan with this tilak, Dukhi Krishna, the disciple of Krita Chaitanya, when he went to Vrindavan, he had this connection with Lalitha Sakhi and Radharani and he got this Tilak. All the people said that he took reinitiation from Jeeva Goswami and Jeeva Goswami has changed his name from Dukhi Krishna to Shamananda. This whole kind of controversy erupted in Vandavan. So to solve this, his own Guru from Mayapur, from Ambika Kalna. From there, Gauridas Pandit's disciple Hridayachaitanya went all the way to Vandavan to settle this issue. But then finally, to make the story short, that it was proven that this Tilak was handed over by Radharani herself to Shamananda and he did not change anything. He considered Hridayachaitanya as his Guru, but Jeeva Goswami and Radharani did not change anything. He considered Hridayachaitanya as his Shiksa Guru for further preaching. So these great personalities went to Jeeva Goswami and Radharani who was a disciple of Lokannath, all went to Jeeva Goswami friend. for further preaching. So these great personalities all went to Jeeva Goswami friend. Narottam Dashtakul who was a disciple of Lokannath also went to Jeeva Goswami to learn. Shamananda, a disciple of Hridayachaitanya went to Jeeva Goswami to learn. And Srinivasacharya's disciple was...

Gopalabhadra Goswami. He also was given under the care of Jeeva Goswami. And Gopalabhadra Goswami had the guidance and guidance like I said. So I am a disciple and the Hadith was So, basically Jiva Goswami is the real authority on Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Prabhupada said Jiva Goswami is the authority, especially because of the shakshandarva he wrote conclusive truth about Krishna, Krishna is the Bhagavan Swayam. And then Baladeva Vidyabhushan, today morning you went to his birthplace. So these personalities actually fixed Gaudiya Vaishnavism as authorized parampara within the Madhya Gaudiya parampara. Especially the Ramanandis and the Ramanujacharyas, they were saying there is no authority to the Gaudiya Vaishnavism, where is your siddhanta coming from and where is your bhashya on the Brahma Sutras. Unless we have a bhashya on Brahma Sutras, we are not going to be able to understand Brahma Sutras. You are not considered an authorized line, because Sri Vaishnavas have their authorized bhashya, Madhya has their authorized bhashya. But what about Gaudiya Vaishnavism?

Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur was a great person. He had authority in those times, but he was very old, so he didn't go to Jaipur, he sent his disciple Baladeva, so Baladeva Vidyabhushan went there and he wrote this bhashya and called it Govinda Bhashya on the 500 sutras of Brahma Sutra. So Prabhupada Goswami, Sanatana Goswami, Jeeva Goswami, Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur, Baladeva Vidyabhushan. And these three preachers, they were the solid foundation for Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to create a big foundation for Gaudiya Vaishnavism.

Not long back, 500 years back, still way down 200, 200, 300 years back it got lost, then again Bhaktivinoda Thakur had to revive it. And then Bhaktivinoda Thakur had to establish another foundation with his 64 Gaudiya Maths. And then it was for our Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada to take it all over the world. Now Gaudiya Vaishnavism is like authority, people say, oh Janmashtami, the way ISKCON is doing, Abhishekam, the way ISKCON is doing, so ISKCON has become a kind of a, what do you call it, benchmark for Bhaktivinoda.

**Summary:** The speaker reflects on the challenges of preaching to a materialistic audience compared to the past, emphasizing the power of Prabhupada's message.

place and remember their sacrifices and we are taking it forward. All of us as preachers, we have our chota-chota jobs and our chota-chota deshas where we preach in different places. But there's a whole force behind that, there's a whole force behind this, there's a whole authority to books. There's a whole authority to conclusions and the whole tradition left by these people. So it's good that we take some time off and see all these places with the Vaishnavas to inspire ourselves and to charge ourselves and go and give it. The only difference is that these personalities we are preaching to people who are very simple. May not be very Vedic, what 50, 60, 100 or 200 years back or 300 years back, people were much more simple. But for us the challenge is we are preaching to hardcore, hardcore, we ourselves are hardcore materialists and we are preaching to hardcore materialists. So the difference is that. And they had the strength of Sanskrit and the strength of Vedic education. What do we have? We just parrot what Prabhupada said, that's it. But that voice of Prabhupada is so strong that it can change the world. Yes. It can change the hearts of thousands of people even though it is just going through our mouth. So we are just postman delivering the message of Prabhupada to the whole world. He is doing the preaching. So the great personality who is doing preaching now and continuing for next 10,000 years is Prabhupada.

### How Can I Overcome Envy Toward Specific Devotees? | Sri Jai Chaitanya Dasa

#### envy, judgment, qualification

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So you are saying, you don't mind qualified people progressing, but you mind when unqualified people progress."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the question of why envy arises towards some devotees and not others, specifically focusing on the perception of who is 'qualified' to progress.

Hare Krishna, Prabhu Dhanwad Pranam. Prabhu, we see this feeling of enviousness is not for everybody. Suppose there are two devotees in ashram who are doing very nice things and they are achieving. So one devotee's nature is very good. He is submissive and humble and he treats everybody nicely. So when he is progressing, I feel good for him. I am not feeling enviousness. But on the other hand, some other devotees who are not respectful or who don't care for others, if he is progressing, then I feel kind of hatred or I would say jealousy. Why is it so that I am not having enviousness for everybody? Same. But for some particular kind of people only. So you are saying, you don't mind qualified people progressing. But you mind when unqualified people progress.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Whatever achievements they are getting, it is by sanction of Krishna and Prabhupada only."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that judging qualification based on external achievements is flawed, as both Krishna's sanction and karma play a role in a devotee's progress.

First of all, how do you classify qualified or unqualified? So you are saying that when unqualified people progress, I feel envious. How can unqualified people progress? Not possible. Whatever achievements they are getting, it is by sanction of Krishna and Prabhupada only. So what you are looking, what you are saying is, you are talking about the facilities he is getting or the position he is getting. You are measuring qualified or not qualified in terms of the visible positions, visible things he is getting. So that itself is wrong from our side because we don't actually, but it is sometimes common, we don't, we should not, by seeing what he is getting, we should not judge whether he is qualified or not qualified. Because karma provides, not Krishna. Right? If some devotee is getting something, he is not really qualified, but he has got something. Karma is also playing.

**Summary:** The speaker cautions against judging devotees based on external humility or achievements, as duplicity and the influence of maya can be deceptive.

But don't think that, oh, Krishna has given, Krishna has blessed him. Or sometimes you find externally a devotee very, very humble, crawling down. Humble so that he crawls down. Paka sadhana, pakka externals. Ah, he got a PhD. I feel happy. But it could be the reverse. Maybe he is a duplicitous person. Right? Where bhakti can be, drama is possible. Sometime in life, maya will hit him. Maya is not going to spare anybody. But maybe now maya is favoring him. He has got some facility. So our measure of who is qualified, who is not qualified is totally wrong. Could be wrong.

**Summary:** The speaker advises against comparison and encourages seeing Krishna as a father providing for all, fostering a sense of brotherhood and sisterhood among devotees.

So the best thing is not to compare. Best thing is always feel that whether it is karma or not. Krishna has provided him. We always conclude that Krishna has provided him. My father has provided him. My father will provide me also whenever I am ready. My father has provided him. So when we identify the Supreme Lord as a father, and all other living beings as brothers and sisters,

**Key Quote:** "Don't feel consoled by mental justifications."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of finding consolation in spiritual philosophy (Shastra) rather than relying on mental justifications to deal with feelings of envy.

then the same father is providing for him, same father is providing for me too. So when we try to compare and analyze, so when we try to compare and analyze too much, we get in the wrong path. So it is not our position or our requirement just to console. You have to take spiritual philosophy as a consoling matter. Feel consoled by the Shastra. Don't feel consoled by mental justifications. And we should feel, what is Shastra saying? So by absorbing oneself in the philosophy, one should feel consoled.

**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges that mistakes can happen, encourages dependence on Krishna, and stresses the importance of being happy for others without justifying one's peace of mind through judgments.

Yeah, sometimes it may pain. Or maybe there was a mistake in the management also. Nobody is God. The management can also make mistake or this person should have got better, that person somehow got it. Nobody is God. Mistakes can happen. Depend on Krishna. So what you said is correct. Be happy for others. That's good. Be happy for others. That's a good qualification. But don't try to justify my happiness, my peace of mind, because of certain judgments I make. We should feel peaceful ourselves. We should feel full. What Shastras say.

**Key Quote:** "Easy to change outside, then inside automatically follows outside."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that by acting without seeking results, one can become fixed in consciousness, and that in spiritual life, changing external actions can lead to internal transformation.

And when you act in such a way where we are not looking for the result, you will slowly, slowly get, be fixed in consciousness. So the body is doing all sinful activities. Your mind will also be sinful. Other way round also. If the mind is always sinful, the body will also follow the mind. When there is acceptance, when the external body is acting, something is happening inside also. The ability to cross beyond dualities is happening inside. That is why we say external actions are important to change the insides. Many times we see psychologically, if you change the insides, you can change the outside. But in spiritual life, it's easy to change the outside, then the inside automatically follows the outside.

So, this is the spot where Narottam Das Thakur had his last Leela. Narottam Das Thakur was absorbed in singing the glories of Lord Gauranga and Nityananda, day and night. By the mercy of his lotus feet, several atheists, agnostics, offenders, demigod worshippers, dry logicians, speculators, etc. were all delivered. Hearing the terrible news of the disappearance of Sri Ramachandra Kaviraj, who was a very dear friend, Narottama plunged into an ocean of grief. Added to his grief, shortly, the spiritual master of Ramachandra, Sri Srinivasacharya, also left this planet. Arriving at Gambila, Narottam Das Thakur ordered his disciples, Sri Ramakrishna and Ganga Narayan Chakravarti, to arrange for his bathing in Padma. He entered the waters after repeatedly paying his obeisances. Standing there in the water, he then ordered his disciples to wipe his body. Then, as Ganga Narayan and Ramakrishna were cleansing the body of their spiritual master, Sri Narottama merged into the waters of Padma and vanished from worldly view. His disappearance was just as milk vanishes in water. It is believed that Thakur Mahasaya wrapped up his earthly Leela and manifested his disappearance.

With a choked-up voice, he sang this song in great lamentation. Swaroopa, Roopa, Sanatana, Raghunatha and the Bhattas, be kind to me. Acharya Srinivasa, whose servant is Ramachandra, can I have their association once again? Without seeing their face, my heart is pierced, just like a doe struck by a poisonous arrow.

There, King Narsimha, Rupanarayana, Krishna Simha, Chandanaraya, Sri Gopiramana, Sri Govinda, King Santosharaya and others started preparation for a great festival. Due to fear of unnecessarily increasing the size of this book, I am restraining myself from giving an elaborate description of the festival. When the devotees started Sankirtana in the courtyard of Lord Gauranga's temple, Devi Dasa, Gauranga, Gokula, Govinda Kaviraj and others soon forgot their external identities and began to roll on the ground. They rolled like lions and soaked the ground with their tears. Suddenly, due to the favor of their guru, Krishna, and the Vaishnavas, everyone had a chance to witness Narottama Das dancing with them again. When he suddenly vanished, everyone lost their composure. And so Narottama Das Thakur once again appeared and consoled them all.

At Bada Govinda Bari Temple, rests today the enchanting Golden Gauranga Deity, that was once worshipped by Narottam Das Thakura. There is a very interesting pastime regarding how Narottam Das Thakur discovered this Gauranga Deity. In the province of Gopalpur, there lived a pious Brahmana. He was a Brahmin. He was a Brahmin. He was a Brahmin. His name was Vipra Dasa. Mahaprabhu revealed to Narottam Das Thakura in his dream one night that his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deities were presently resting at the house of this Brahmana. These Deities lay hidden in his huge container of paddy. When Mahaprabhu left Bengal for Puri, after accepting his sannyas initiation, he manifested these enchanting Deities and hid them inside his paddy. In the course of time, they landed up in the house of this Brahmana. But this Brahmana was completely unaware of this. So when Narottam Das Thakur arrived at the house of this Brahmana the next day and wanted to look into his huge mount of paddy, the Brahmana warned him that a huge venomous snake lived in it, and it was not safe to go near it. Regardless, Shri Narottama entered the paddy container. He was very happy. He entered the paddy container, and immediately the huge snake appeared and walked out of the mount. All present were very filled with wonder. Soon Thakura Mahasaya discovered his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deities from the paddy and grabbed them dearly.

**Summary:** Lord Chaitanya led a civil disobedience movement against Chand Kazi, debated with him, and transformed his heart through Shravanam, highlighting the power of hearing to awaken Krishna Prema.

Nadia district, where Navadvip is located, was under the jurisdiction of Chand Kazi, who worked under Nawab Hussain Shah. Under the Kazi's order, his soldiers disrupted Sankirtana, congregational chanting of the Lord's holy names, on the streets of Navadvip. Interestingly, Lord Chaitanya then conducted the very first civil disobedience movement, attended by thousands of devotees, to protest the order of the Kazi and the actions of his soldiers. By seeing that big gathering, Chand Kazi got scared and he hid in the home. Somehow, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu convinced Chand Kazi to come out and had a debate with him and transformed his heart. In this way, Chand Kazi became a great Vaishnava. It is because it is a result of hearing from Lord Chaitanya. Shravanam, the process of Shravanam, is so powerful. Krishna Raj Kaviraj Goswami says this Shravanam process can immediately awaken Krishna Prema.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the extreme mercy of the Lord, using the example of Putana, and emphasizes that even a small act of devotion is recognized and rewarded by Krishna.

So, we read from Srimad Bhagavatam, 3rd Canto, Chapter 2, Text 23. The matter of remembrance of Lord Krishna. Translation. Purport. Here is an example of the extreme mercy of Lord, even to his enemy. It is said that a noble man accepts the good qualities of a person of doubtful character, just as one accepts nectar from a stalk of poison. In his babyhood, he was administered deadly poison by Putana, a Shri demon who tried to kill the wonderful baby. And because she was a demon, it was impossible for her to know that the Supreme Lord, even though playing the part of a baby, was no one else than the same Supreme Person. His value as the Supreme Lord did not diminish upon his becoming a baby to please his devotee, Yashoda. The Lord may assume the form of a baby or a shape other than that of a human being, but it doesn't make the slightest difference. He is always the same Supreme. A living creature, however powerful he may become, by dint of severe penance, can never become equal to the Supreme Lord. accepted the motherhood of Putana because she pretended to be an affectionate mother allowing Krishna to suck her breast. The Lord accepts the least qualification of the living entity and awards him the highest reward. That is a standard of his character. Therefore, who but the Lord can be the ultimate

**Key Quote:** "The Lord does not take our limitations, but the Lord does consider offenses done to another Vaishnava."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of associating with devotees (sadhu sangha), avoiding offenses to Vaishnavas, and the significance of surrendering to the Lord through dedication and austerity, particularly in the context of the parikrama.

shelter. Spiritual life done alone, parikrama done alone, these are all not as powerful as doing it in the company of a shavas, so sadhu sangha, that is the most important thing. And as Bhakti we know said, he decides to do this along with the Sangha of maestro. So we are very fortunate that we get this opportunity to do this, and we pray that we do this parikrama with the least dhamma parath, the least ways from a parath, the least mama parath. We are all coming to light, conditioned souls. So there are chances that we think differently. So we pray that we don't offend the Dham, the Vaishnavas, we go with. The Lord accepts Putana, demoness, because she had that few minutes of affection, at least to show affection. And the Lord has granted her such a high position as his mother. So the Lord does not take our limitations, but the Lord does consider offenses done to another Vaishnava. Offenses done because that shows that we don't recognize his creation, all the living entities. So keeping away from these offenses, respectful to all the Vaishnavas, doing Sankirtan is very important. The Lord will recognize, even though we have limitations, he will recognize that moments of surrender we do to him. So this act of 20 days dedicating to him itself is a surrender. Keeping aside so many things, so many important work would be there, but we keep that aside. So many family responsibilities are there, so many business responsibilities are there. We keep them all aside, and we come and dedicate. That is such a big surrender. The Lord will do that, recognizes these things and the difficulties we may go through, the difficulties to catch up with the team, right, to be together. So all these are different surrender, different different austerities of the mind, austerities of the body. So it's an opportunity to do all these things. So the Lord

But then who is that Govinda Mukunda who took Gadadhara to Pundarika Vidyanidhi to meet a great devotee. So Gadadhar Pandit saw his house so opulent and he is chewing pan, always red mouth, big couch sitting there. But then I think it is Mukunda who sang this verse. The moment this verse was chanted, Pundarika went into the rapture of of ecstasy and he was like mad man. So seeing that he could understand what a great personality he is. Just by hearing this mercy of the Supreme Lord to Putana, he has gone into this ecstatic position. He kind of threw everything, broke everything in that room. Nobody could control him. He was so mad in love of Krishna. So that is why Gadadhar said, I offended him, now I should take shelter of him, I should take and he took initiation from Pundarika Vidyanidhi and he took initiation from Pundarika Vidyanidhi. So Gadadhar Pandita, an expansion of Radharani, Pundarika, an expansion of Vishwabanna. So they connect, they get connected in Gaur Lila in that form, right? So it's an important verse

With him, he conspired with the prostitute and asked them to lure Haridas and deviate him from his vow of austerity. Among those prostitutes, one young and very attractive girl named Hira Bai was selected. Hira was very confident and assured Ramachandra Khan that she would be able to accomplish her job within three days. Ramachandra wanted to send a constable with Hira so that he could arrest Haridas as soon as he would try to get anywhere close to the girl. However, Hira Bai wanted to get intimate with Haridas Chakur at least once before Haridas was arrested. So, she requested Ramachandra Khan to send a constable when she would unite with Haridas for the second time. So, as planned, Hira Bai approached the cottage of Haridas Chakur in the middle of the night. She dressed herself very well and stood there exposing a part of her body to his view. She flattered Haridas Chakur, saying how beautiful he looked and how desperate she was to enjoy him. She explained that it would not be possible for her to continue living if she does not get to unite with Srila Haridas. Tumara Sangam Alagi Lubdhamo Ramana Tumana Paile Pranana Yaya Dharana Chaitanya Chaita Amrita Antya 3.11.3.

In course of time, Ramachandra Kanth received the results of offending Vaishnavas, especially that of offending an exalted devotee like Haridas Thakur. When Lord Nityananda returned to Bengal to preach Bhakti, he began touring all over the country. Thus, it so happened that he, along with his followers, once visited Benapur and rested at the Durga Mantapa of Ramachandra Kanth. Ramachandra Kanth objected to this and sent his servant to convey the message that the devotees should select a different place for their stay. Lord Nityananda, on hearing this, became very angry and started laughing out loudly. He exclaimed that Ramachandra Kanth had rightly spoken that the place was unfit for the devotees to take rest. Instead, it was only fit for cow-killing meat eaters. Saying this, Lord Nityananda along with his followers left the village. A demon might make a great show of religiosity by conducting Durga Puja festivals or occasions like that. Yet, he can be easily identified by the way he treats other devotees or by the degree of his enviousness. Repeatedly committing Vaishnava Pradha, Ramachandra Khan was in no position to realize that Nityananda Prabhu was none other than Lord Balarama.

From his village he came here. When is not given. Date is not given. He wanted to go away from the people and the town and the village, so he came here and chanted. From here he went. It is right across the river. You can cross the river and access many of those places in Navadvimya. Namacharya Haridas Thakur Ki Lakshah Hira Devi Ki.

### Sri Balaram Jayanti Festival Discourse 2025 | His Grace Jai Chaitanya Dasa
**Speaker:** HG Jai Chaitanya Dasa

#### Balarama's importance, Krishna's enjoyment, Spiritual purification

**Key Quote:** "Unless he comes and purifies, Krishna cannot come there."
**Summary:** This segment introduces Balarama as the elder brother of Krishna, the first expansion of the Lord, and emphasizes his role in purifying the environment and the devotee's heart to make way for Krishna's presence.

Welcome to all of you on this occasion of Balaram Purnima, Balaram Jayanti. Balaram Jayanti comes always before Krishna Jayanti, and Balaram appeared as the elder brother of Krishna, elder brother of God. Then the elder brother should be the God. But no, our God is Krishna, the Supreme Personality of God. Sarvakarana Karanam. He is Raso Vaisaha. He is full of Rasa. His existence is full of Rasa, interactive enjoyment. Purpose of life is enjoyment, but we do not know how to enjoy because we try to catch all diaramas for enjoyment, and diaramas don't give enjoyment. Only real life gives enjoyment. So in the spiritual world, there is only enjoyment, Satchik, Ananda, eternity, knowledge, and bliss. This is the existence in the spiritual world. So to this material world, the Supreme Lord comes in different, different forms. In Goloka Vrindavan, where Krishna, the Supreme Lord, is always enjoying, He has his brother, elder brother, because he wanted an elder brother. Because he wanted an elder brother, who can become his elder brother? He wanted a friend. Who can be his friend? Only he himself can. So, the first expansion, the first incarnation in one sense, the first expansion is Balaram, Baladeva. So whenever a person says, Balaram is the true God of Liberation. So whenever Krishna appears, before that Balarama appears. Just like in the womb of Devaki also, Balarama appeared first, just before Krishna. However, it was considered as a miscarriage. Why? Because he was attracted by the womb of Rohini. Hence, Sankarsana, he took birth as Rohini Nandan rather than Devaki Nandan. Krishna is Devaki Nandan, Krishna is Ashodan Nandan. Balarama is Rohini Nandan, another wife of Vasudeva. But he appears. Why does he appear? Because unless he comes and purifies, Krishna cannot come there. Only when Balarama comes and purifies, then the seat is worth to invite Krishna. So, even in our heart, unless Balarama appears first, Krishna cannot come. And in Chaitanya Leela, Krishna appeared as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Balarama appeared as Nithyananda Prabhu. So, if you want to get the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, we have to get the mercy of Nithyananda, who is Balarama. All the paraphernalia we use to worship Krishna is Balarama. All the pots, all the aarati, all the items we use to worship Krishna, because no material things can be used to worship Krishna.

#### Spiritualization, Balarama as Adiguru, Spiritual strength

**Key Quote:** "Only Balarama can spiritualize things."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on Balarama's role in spiritualizing material objects for Krishna's worship, identifies him as the original Guru (Adiguru), and explains that Balarama provides the spiritual strength (Bala) needed to attain Krishna.

God cannot accept anything material. He can only accept anything spiritual, and only Balarama can spiritualize things. So, Pujaris, before they worship, they spiritualize everything with the Pancharatra mantras and come to the level of Krishna's spirituality to worship him with all the spiritual things, which represents Balarama. His bedding is Balarama. His pillow is Balarama. Burdanga is Balarama. Kartal is Balarama. So, for a devotee, everything is to be respectfully used. The asana, the vigraha, all the asanas you make for the Supreme Lord, the altar you make for the Supreme Lord, that is also Sankarsana. So, the Lord, Lord Vishnu only sleeps on Sankarsana. You can provide him any pillow, goose chest pillow, he will not accept. He will only lie down on Sankarsana. So, Sankarsana, Balarama, is the most important personality in all of our spiritual life because with his blessing, with his mercy, we can get Krishna. We can know Krishna. So, the person who takes us to Krishna, that is Guru. Hence, Balarama is Adiguru Nithyananda. He is Adiguru. Unless we get the blessing of Guru, Shri Guru, we cannot get the Supreme Lord. So, and Guru, what is Guru? Guru is a mercy incarnation of the Supreme Lord. Hence, Balarama is a merciful incarnation of Krishna who shows the way. So, Balarama also gives Bala, not bodybuilding Bala, but spiritual Bala, because we need spiritual Bala to get Krishna, not physical Bala. Physical Bala will help you to do Krishna Seva better, but won't give Krishna.

#### Balarama's subservience to Krishna, Krishna's happiness, Relationship with the Lord

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Balarama, the elder brother, his only wish is to satisfy Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment describes Balarama's unwavering desire to satisfy Krishna, even in complex situations like the Mahabharata, and highlights Krishna's pleasure in being addressed in relation to his devotees, emphasizing the importance of personal relationships with the Lord.

That Bala comes from Balarama. So, in Vrindavan, Krishna and Balarama, even though Balarama is elder to Krishna, he will only say yes to Krishna, anything he wants. In the house, if our elder brothers stay like this, we will not be able to get Krishna. If our elder brothers stay like this, how good it could have been. But elder brothers are not like that. But Balarama, the elder brother, his only wish is to satisfy Krishna, because he was also put into confusion at the time of Mahabharata Yuta, which side will Krishna have into Pandavas. I like Duryodhana, but I can't fight against Krishna. So, he went for Tirta Yatra. So, he never does anything against the Vishnu of Krishna. In Dwaraka, he protects Dwaraka. He and him and Krita Verma, under him, the entire Narayaniya, Vanakshahuni soldiers, army of Balarama. The entire army was given to Kauravas, under Krita Verma. That's all the complexities of warfare. But Balarama always wants the satisfaction of his younger brother. And Krishna also does not like to be called Krishna. See Krishna, not very happy. You call him Balabhadra Anuja, he is very happy. Krishna Purvaja, that is Balarama. You call him Partha Sarathi, he is happy. You call him Rukmini, Rukripyatma, he is happy. You call him Devaki Nandan, he is happy. Krishna is happy. So, the Lord always wants to associate with the relationship, and that is our Swaroopa, relationship with the Lord. It is not that God is a big boss and we are all servants like in the material world, no. Yes, we are servants, but we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. And as a part of Him, we too enjoy in His association. Just like the spark is always full of bliss. When the spark is in the fire, as soon as the spark gets out of the fire, it dies away. In the same way, we, the spiritual spark, Amsha of the Supreme Lord Krishna, we too are satisfied only when that connection with Krishna comes back.

#### Balarama's importance in Vaishnavism, Purification for Krishna's mercy, Hare Krishna Mahamantra

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Balarama's mercy is most important."
**Summary:** This segment underscores Balarama's significance in the Vaishnava tradition, stating that his mercy is essential for spiritual purification and attaining Krishna's grace, and connects Balarama to the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, explaining that 'Rama' represents both strength and pleasure potency.

And that connection with Krishna, if we want, then Balarama. That is the very most important personality. Hence, in the Bhagavata Sampradaya, Gaudiya Sampradaya, the Vaishnava Sampradaya, which we follow, Balarama is very important, more important than Krishna. Just like Guru is more important than the Lord. So Balarama's mercy is most important, and He always sees that only those purified souls get relationship with the Supreme Lord. So for our spiritual purification, He plays a very important role. In the Hare Krishna Mahamantra also, there are three levels of chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. The second level is Krishna and Balarama. Sopa says Balarama provides the strength, and not only strength, Rama also means pleasure potency. So the spiritual pleasure, spiritual bliss, spiritual strength is given by Balarama. Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Rama. And the final stage is Radha Krishna. Rama means Radha Krishna. Jubala Jodi. So he plays a very important role in the purification of the spirit soul in receiving Krishna's mercy. That is the final goal, to receive Krishna. That is not possible unless Balarama is satisfied.

#### Sankarsana Consciousness, Spiritual knowledge, Importance of Guru and Vaishnavas

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He has to create Sankarsana Consciousness."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Balarama expands in different forms and emphasizes the need to develop Sankarsana Consciousness (spiritual consciousness) to invite the Lord into our hearts, highlighting the crucial roles of Guru, Krishna, and Vaishnavas in spiritual life.

So in the material world, He expands in different forms. He expands as Ananda Sesha in the coastal ocean. Ananda Sesha as Garbhodaka ocean. Ananda Sesha in the Svetadvipa. The same way, if the Lord has to come in our heart, He has to create Sankarsana Consciousness. And what is Sankarsana Consciousness? Nothing but absolute spiritual consciousness, Akhanda Brahman. So with spiritual knowledge, the equality, spiritual equality that comes in a Sadaka before Sri Sri Radha Krishna appears in his heart. So Balarama, as we know, in Vrindavan, in Dwaraka, everywhere, he has taken this subservient role to the Supreme Personality of God. So Krishna, this Krishna Consciousness movement is a movement which is very very personal and very very relationship oriented. Hence, for us, Guru, Krishna, Vaishnavas, they all become very important part in our spiritual life.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual knowledge comes from Seva, purifying the senses by doing Seva."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that spiritual knowledge is attained through selfless service (Seva), which purifies the senses and mind, and highlights the importance of temples as spiritual hubs created by Prabhupada for purification and connection with the Supreme Lord.

Vaishnavas play a very important role because Guru, Sri Guru appears, instructs the disciple in different ways. It is not that one overnight we get spiritual knowledge. Spiritual knowledge comes from Seva, purifying the senses by doing Seva. That is why Krishna Seva is given so much importance. Rishikena, Rishikesha, Saivana, Bhakti Rucha. Rishikena, Rishikesha, Rishikesha, is Supreme Lord Krishna. Rishika is the senses. So when the senses are utilized in serving the Supreme Lord, Rishikesha, then the senses get purified. When the senses get purified, mind gets purified. Intelligence gets purified. The entire existence becomes purified. In that purified existence, chanting Hare Krishna, that makes a connection with the Supreme Lord. It's always Seva. That is why Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, our Acharya, made these temples of all over the world. He said these are the places, these are all spiritual hubs where you can come and purify. So purification happens in this place. So that is why here in, near Ananagar, he opened this branch. Small place, but any Seva done here with pure mind reaches the Supreme, Goloka Vrindavan. There is no difference between where it is. You may have some, you may have some inconveniences here, but if you do Seva humbly to satisfy Guru and Krishna, it reaches. And Balaram notices that.

#### Liberation from material world, Negative experiences, Dukhalayam Asasratam

**Verse References:** SB 8.22.2
**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "This is not a good place to be in."
**Summary:** This segment explains the need for liberation from the material world, describing it as a place of suffering (Dukhalayam), and uses the analogy of a meat-eater to illustrate how negative experiences are necessary to understand the true nature of material enjoyment.

When Balaram notices that, he gives. So, Balaram, represented here by the spiritual master, they are all watching because the whole idea of spiritual master, Balaram, is to see that the living entities get liberation from this material world. Why should we get liberated from the material world? Because this is not a good place to be in. If you want to know this is not a good place to be in, you should have some negative experiences in this material world. Otherwise, you think this material world is very nice. Like, there is a story. The Western world. Tell a meat eater, Westerner who is meat eater, all kinds of sin he does. He says, don't do sin. Why? I feel good doing all these things. Smoking, meat eating, humanizing, intoxicating. I know good. I feel this enjoyment. No, you will go to hell. No, my family, everybody does this. All of them will go to hell. Oh, then hell is a good place. I will go to hell. All my family members are there. So, if you do not know what is good and what is bad, you will think this is the right enjoyment, but this is not the right enjoyment. We can hear from the Shastras that Krishna himself declares Dukhalayam Asasratam. Don't try to be happy in this world. This is Dukhalayam.

#### Experiencing Dukha, Intelligence levels, Permanent happiness

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Material world cannot give you permanent happiness."
**Summary:** This segment discusses different levels of intelligence in recognizing the suffering inherent in the material world, emphasizing that true happiness cannot be found in temporary material possessions and that purification is necessary to free the soul.

This is the place of Dukha. We may hear, we will not understand. So, we commit some activities in the material world and face Dukha. Or then we say, oh, this is Dukha. Some people, even after experiencing Dukha, will continue like a camel eating their thorn, tasting the blood. So, sometimes people like to taste their own blood without knowing. So, this is called third-class intelligence. You taste this dirty world as good. Second-class intelligence means that you know what is good and what is bad. So, you know what is good and what is bad. So, second-class intelligence is when you get a beating, this place is not good. Let us go back and see what is good. And first-class intelligence is when you hear from the spiritual master, when you hear from the sastras, you already experience yes, material world is not good. Why? Because material world cannot give you permanent happiness, and we all want happiness. Everybody wants a house. Everybody wants a job. Everybody wants a job. Everybody wants a vehicle. Everybody wants a fridge. Everybody wants a TV. Everybody wants a flat. Why? To be happy. But are you happy? No. Why? Because once you get one thing, then there are ten problems connected to that. I want mobile phone, iPhone, earphone, Apple phone, orange phone. But no connectivity. Your house is in a guha. There is no connection. What is this? So, for every desire, there are ten obstructions in this material world. How much can we enjoy with our senses? How much can you eat? So, there is limitation in this material world, but the soul is unlimited. The soul is not to be limited by all these temporary things. So, to free the soul, layer by layer, we need to purify

ourselves, come to the level of Krishna Consciousness where the real bliss comes within the heart. So, this is why these temples are made all over the world, where you all can come, come together and do seva, satisfy the Lord and purify ourselves, and gradually, gradually, gradually, come to the conclusion that Krishna, Krishna is to Bhagawan Swayam. As Bhagavatam says, Krishna is to Bhagawan Swayam. In South India, most popular is Vishnu is considered as the Supreme Bhagawan, right? All the incarnations come through Vishnu in this material world. But in Bhagavatam, it is said, and all the South Indians read Bhagavatam. Why? People think that only Aishwarya that is the position of the Supreme Lord. No. The position of the Supreme Lord is also Aishwarya, very official. Aham taham sarva paap ye bhyo moksha So, the Lord is there for us to serve Him as Vishnu. He is standing in Tirupati waiting for all of us, accepting our services. That's

official. If you want to know a person, is official identity enough? No. That is only one part of that of friendship. Like Arjuna had. Dasi has one thing and there is friendship. You know the person more than his friend, but you will not know him as much as his wife knows him. So, the parakhya rasa, the madhurya rasa, that is the parakhya rasa. It is only one part of the parakhya . This is the Parakhya rasa. The parakhya is the true one of the parakhya . So, now it is To achieve him, to get him, we need the mercy of Balarama. So Balarama, Purnima, the appearance of Balarama is very, very, very sacred, very, very important, even though public do not recognize, they recognize Janmashtami. But Baladeva, Balarama, Purnima is one of the very important functions. So we are here today celebrating that. May the Lord bless all of us to get his mercy, to go back to Supreme Lord Krishna.

So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to go to Vrindavan after Sanyas, but then Nithyananda Prabhu tricked him. Instead of going to Vrindavan, he showed the way towards Shantipur, which is Advaita Acharya's house. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was in ecstasy. He had no idea where he was going. He wanted to go to Vrindavan, but Nithyananda Prabhu brought him to Shantipur, Advaita Acharya's house. And Advaita Acharya called Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mother, Sachi Mata, because now he has become a mendicant, he has become a Sanyasi. He will go away to Vrindavan or other places. Mother will not be able to see Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Already the mother is in great pain. So, Advaita Acharya brought Sachi Mata to Shantipur so Chaitanya Mahaprabhu could meet her. So, one request Sachi Mata had was that he doesn't go to Vrindavan, that he make his headquarters in Jagannath Puri, because in Jagannath Puri and Calcutta, devotees always come and go. So, she said, "I will get some information about you. I will hear about you from people who come from Jagannath Puri. So, please make your residence in Jagannath Puri."

In any house, they don't keep your treasure in the outer rooms. The most inner room, that is where treasure is kept. So, the treasure called Chaitanya was also residing. So, that's why it is called Gambhira. He resided there for 12 years totally immersed in separation with Krishna.

After relishing this wonderful sight, Ramachandra and Srinivasa's meditation broke and they regained their external consciousness. Srinivasa embraced Ramachandra Kaviraj, who offered his respectful obeisances onto the lotus feet. Ramachandra still had with him the betel nut remnants of Radharani in his hands, and he thereafter distributed the Mahaprasadam onto all present. Being relieved, all the devotees glorified the two of them and blissfully chanted the Lord's holy name. So these personalities are called Vibhuti Patis. They are Lords in both the Vibhuti of the Lord. The material world is one Vibhuti of the Lord, a small portion. The spiritual world is the main Vibhuti of the Lord. So these personalities can, while being in this material world, be in the spiritual world also, and take part in the Leelas in the spiritual world also.

**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Hrishikananda Prabhu meeting his guru, Shamananda Prabhu, highlighting the importance of sincere prayer and divine guidance in finding a spiritual master and receiving initiation.

So we will just read, I have one or two paragraphs about Hrishikananda. So Hrishikananda Prabhu, the disciple of Shamananda Prabhu. Sri Hrishikananda Prabhu was born in 1590 in the village of Rayani, in the Medinipura district. His father's name was Raja Achuthananda, a rich zamindar, and his mother, Bhavani Devi. Medinapur district used to be part of Orissa kingdom. Hrishikananda was also known by the name Hrishikamurari. Hrishikamurari meets Shamananda Prabhu. One day, Hrishikamurari was meditating in a solitary place. He was anxious to find a spiritual master who could give him spiritual direction. He had entered into a very deep meditation when he heard a disembodied voice say, "Murari, you need not be anxious any longer. Your guru is Shamananda Prabhu and you will meet him here very shortly. Take shelter of him and your life will be successful." Upon hearing this divine message, Murari began chanting the name of Shamananda on his beads with joyful enthusiasm. He spent the entire night crying out of his desire to meet his guru. At dawn, Hrishikamurari was on the lookout for his guru when he saw the tall figure of Shamananda approaching him, as effulgent as the sun, surrounded by his disciples. He started dancing and chanting the name of Lord Nityananda. Having waited anxiously for so long to encounter his guru, Hrishikamurari immediately fell at his feet. Shamananda affectionately lifted him up and embraced him and later initiated him with the Radha Krishna mantra.

**Summary:** This segment describes Advaita Acharya's birth name Kamalaksha, his mother's dream, his promise to bring the holy rivers to Lauda, and the creation of Paana Tirtha and Jadukatha river.

Waves of divine ecstasy flooded the people of Navahadevi. On the advice of learned astrologers, Shri Kubera Pandita and Navahadevi named their son Kamalaksha. Navahadevi once desired to take a dip in the holy Ganges. She saw a dream one night in which her son Kamalaksha revealed himself as four-handed Lord Vishnu. Beholding the Supreme Lord before her, she immediately offered her prayers in glorification. Shri Advaita assured his mother and vowed to summon all the holy rivers to Lauda, so that she does not have to travel to bathe in the Ganges. Upon waking up, Navahadevi seemed quite confused. Although she was initially reluctant to disclose her dream, Navahadevi finally revealed it to her son on his insistence. A seven-year-old Advaita then shone again and he would bring all the holy Tirthas to Lauda to fulfill the desires of his dear mother. Thereafter, during the night, Shri Advaita entered into a deep meditation and summoned the holy rivers. He then ordered them to reside at Lauda during the Madhu Krishna Trayodashi Tithi so that his mother can bathe in them. Accordingly, Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada, Kaveri, Saraswati, Udavari, etc. reached and gathered near the mountains of Lauda. The next morning, Advaita Acharya took his mother so that she could experience the wonder with her own eyes. As soon as Advaita chanted the names of the Supreme Lord and blew upon his conch shell, the holy rivers started pouring down from the mountains. Some of them were reddish, some were bluish, some were white, while some were yellow. Shri Kamalaksha introduced each of the rivers to his mother. This exalted dham came to be subsequently known as Paana Tirtha as it was Advaita Acharya's vow, Paana in Bengali means vow, that had caused the holy river to descend to this place. This newly created water body came to be known as Jadukatha river as it was shaped by Advaita's magic.

On the bank of this Jadukatha river stands a beautiful temple renowned as Advaita Mahari. The occasion of Kali Puja was celebrated with great pomp and show at Lauda. On one such year, King Divya Raya had made all the necessary arrangements. The Pandits and Ramanas and all the residents of Nabha Gram were invited to the royal palace to attend this grand festival. Shri Advaita had also come to attend the occasion along with Kubera Pandita. When the king noticed that Shri Advaita did not pay obeisances unto the deity of Goddess Kali, he requested him to do the same. Shri Advaita however refused, reasoning that any person who worships other demigods or demigoddesses instead of worshipping the Supreme Lord Shri Krishna is cast into bewilderment and material misery. Hearing his son's statement, Shri Kubera Pandita countered Advaita and urged him to pay his obeisances unto Maa Kali to not disrespect her. Shri Advaita consented to fulfill his father's desire, but as soon as Advaita Acharya entered the temple and paid his prostrated obeisances, the deity of Kali broke into pieces. The king came to tears witnessing the broken deity. Goddess Kali could not tolerate receiving obeisances from Shri Advaita, the combined incarnation of Mahavishnu and Sadashiva, her most worshipable lord. Shri Advaita did not wish to reveal his divine identity to anyone just yet. Hence, after this pastime, he moved over to Shantipur where he occupied himself with studying devotional scriptures and propagating the glories of Shri Krishna.

**Summary:** Shyamananda's preaching in Bengal and Orissa, Radharani's special mercy upon him in Vrindavan (finding her ankle bracelet), the origin of the Nupura Tilaka, and the identification of the Samanandis.

Throughout Bengal and Orissa, Narottama went to northern Bengal and Shamananda went to Orissa. Radharani's special mercy on Shamananda. Even though Shamananda Prabhu was Hrudaya Chaitanya's initiated disciple, his guru had entrusted him to the care of Jivagoswami Prabhu. Through the association of Jiva and service to him, Shamananda developed a taste for serving Radha and Krishna. In the conjugal mood, an extraordinary incident which took place in Vrindavan prior to his being ordered by Jiva to return to Orissa, demonstrates how dear Shamananda was to Radharani. One day, Shamananda Prabhu was sweeping the Rasa Mandala in Vrindavan, absorbed in an ecstatic trance. Suddenly, by Radharani's transcendental mercy, he found her ankle bracelet torn. He saw the ankle bracelet lying on the ground. In his excitement, he touched the ankle bracelet to his forehead, where it left a mark preserved to this day as the Tilak marking of the disciple's descendant of Shamananda. It is known as Nupura Tilaka. You must have noticed the Tilaka that Babaji is wearing is the shape of the footprint of Radharani or Nupura. There are two stories, one says it is Radharani's seat, one says it is Nupura. So it is called Nupura Tilaka. So they are called the Samanandis today.

Shamananda Prabhu's preaching Narottama Das Thakur and Shamananda primarily preached the message of Mahaprabhu through Kirtan. Srinivas sang Kirtan in a style called Manoharasahi. Manoharasahi in Karanahati and Shamananda in Renithi, these are the three styles of Kirtan, which was popularized by these three personalities. He would enchant the listeners with his heartfelt singing of Kirtan. As a result of his preaching in Orissa, many Muslims also became Shamananda's disciples. The most important of his innumerable disciples was Resika Murari. Resikananda was the son of Achutananda, the Jamindar of Rohini village.

**Key Quote:** "Chaitanya Mahaprabhu predicted his arrival."
**Summary:** This segment recounts Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's prediction of Narottama Das Thakur's birth and the anticipation among the devotees, culminating in his auspicious birth.

Narottama. Even before the birth of Narottam Das Thakur, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu predicted his arrival. And while he was in Ramkeli, while coming back from Kanena Shala, he was walking the other side of the river. And he looked at, actually Ramkeli is just the other side. We went about 100 kilometers, came about. But it's the other side. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was looking at this direction and went on calling the name Narottama, Narottama, Narottama. So all the Vaishnumas standing there could know that some great personality is going to come. And Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was looking at this direction. Same thing happened in Orissa when he was calling Srinivasa's name, before the arrival of Srinivasa Thakur. So in your small book there is a prayer to Narottama Das Thakur. We can chant that first. Shri Krishna Nama Amrita Varshi Vaktra Chandraprabha Dvashtha Tamo Bharaya Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Gauranga Deva Aucharaya Tasmai Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu stayed at Ramkeli for a few days, constantly surrounded by an ocean of ecstatic devotees who were eager to bathe in the purifying waters of the Lord's transcendental association. Not only was the general mass of people affected by the Lord, but even the Mohammedan king had a change of heart due to Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's presence. One day, as Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was dancing with his associates during Sankirtana, he suddenly looked in the direction of Shri Keturi village. A peculiar look appeared on his face. Tears came to his eyes and he cried out Narottama, Narottama again and again. The ocean of mercy, Nithyananda Raya, shouted with joy and Haridas, Vakreshwara and others were inexplicably filled with unbounded happiness. Witnessing this unusual behavior of the Lord, the devotees began talking amongst themselves as follows. Prabhu is repeatedly calling out the name of someone called Narottama. It seems that this Narottama is extremely devious. Perhaps he is about to make his appearance. Oh, who is that fortunate man who will have such a son! The woman who bears him within her womb certainly is the most fortunate lady in this world. Obviously, the Lord has some plan for this Narottama to fulfill his missions. In this way, rumors of Narottama's impending appearance spread far and wide. Oh, who is this Narottama? The wheel of time turned until finally during the sixth hour of the full moon day in the month of Magha,

**Summary:** This segment details Narottama Das Thakur's birth, the astrological predictions surrounding him, his refusal to eat until food is offered to Lord Vishnu, and the subsequent emphasis on the importance of Prasad.

when all auspicious signs became visible, Narottamadas was born to fulfill the mission of the Lord. His mother, radiant with beauty, wept joyfully as she lovingly gazed at the charming face of her son. A divine effulgence illuminated the delivery room and happiness swelled within the hearts of everyone present. The delighted Dattamahasaya warmly welcomed everyone without taking his eyes off the face of his son for a second. Krishnananda's exalted father profusely distributed charity to the singers, musicians and other present for the protection of his grandson. So his father is Dattamahasaya, grandfather is Krishnananda. There was no woman in the world as fortunate as Narottamada's mother. Narayana. By the grace of Lord, she was granted the divine vision to see Gauranga, Nityananda and Advaita dancing ecstatically in her house. Narayana jubilantly watched as his son continued to grow like the waxing moon. Similarly, Krishnananda's pleasure grew no bounds as he constantly stared at the jewel-like face of his son. Being grateful because of his great fortune, he fed the local brahmanas. Daily, on an auspicious day, Krishnananda arranged for the ceremony of offering rice to his son. The astrologer present on that joyful occasion noted all the auspicious signs present in the child's body. He predicted that the boy would become an illustrious person, saying, This baby will grow up to be the greatest of men. Therefore, he should be called Narottama. The festivities went on happily until Krishnananda tried to feed his son some rice. To everyone's dismay, the child refused to eat. Although they coaxed him again and again, the boy repeatedly turned his head away, refusing to eat. The festive atmosphere was thus replaced with anxiety as everyone nervously looked at one another, not knowing what to do. The thoughtful astrologer then replied, Don't worry, this boy will not accept food unless it was first offered to Lord Vishnu. The rice was then offered to Lord Vishnu and once again given to the child. To everyone's relief, the baby happily devoured it. From that day onwards, realizing the value of prasad, Krishnananda ordered, Only food that has been offered to Krishna should be given to my son.

According to Prema Vilasa, When Mahaprabhu passed through Kanena Shala, he was dancing ecstatically in Kirtan. He began to call out the name Narottama, Narottama. When Nithyananda asked him why he was calling out this name, Mahaprabhu answered, There will be one exalted devotee by the name Narottama, will soon be born here. Mahaprabhu then went on to the Padmavati river on the place known as Kutuppur, where he bathed and sang and danced in ecstasy. He then called out to the river, O Padmavati, take my love and keep it here. When Narottama comes and bathes here, give it to him. The Padmavati inquired, How will I recognize him? Mahaprabhu answered, You will know it is Narottama, for when he enters your water, you will overflow. The place where Mahaprabhu placed Prema for Narottama's sake, was later given the name Premtali. When Narottama was twelve years old, he had a dream in which Nithyananda Prabhu told him to bathe in the Padmavati and take the Prema which had been stored there for him. He went the next day to the Padma and as soon as he put his foot in the water, the river started to overflow. The Padmavati then remembered Mahaprabhu's words and gave Narottama the Prema which she had been safeguarding for him.

**Summary:** This segment describes the three ways in which Chaitanya Mahaprabhu bestows His mercy: destruction of material miseries, reconciliation of scriptural contradictions, and inspiration for devotional service.

If somebody achieves the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, how will he receive it? Actually, Mahaprabhu bestows His mercy upon the devotees in three ways. The first way a devotee gets the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, very easily, is that all the material miseries are destroyed, and the person becomes purified. Transcendental ecstasy is awakened in his heart, a bliss is awakened in his heart, which covers up all the material miseries, and also all the material pleasures. The second manifestation of the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is, all the contradictions in the scriptures get reconciled, and you are able to understand what is the essence of the scriptures: Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God, and that firmly gets established in your heart. And not only that, what happens is, the transcendental mellows get revealed to us. The third aspect of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mercy is, He establishes inspiration to do devotional service with ecstasy and the appreciation of the conjugal pastimes of Krishna.

Shri Nithyananda Prabhu is none other than Lord Balaram, the first expansion of the Supreme Personality of God. Naratham Das Thakur sings, vrajendra nandana say sachi sutta haila say balram haila nithai. Vrajendra nandana is Lord Krishna, the master of Vraja, and sachi sutta refers to the son of Mother Sachi. So the same person who previously had been the darling of Vrindavana has now incarnated as Sri Chaitanya, the son of Sachi Mata. Similarly, the person who previously had been Lord Balaram has now appeared as Nithyananda Prabhu.

So we saw the house where they were all staying after lunch this afternoon. According to hearsay, after his marriage, Lord Nithyananda had requested the local Zavindar here in Kardaha to kindly allot him a piece of land where he and his family could reside. The Zavindar, being unaware of Lord Nithyananda's divinity, rebuked him for abandoning his sanyasa and accepting a wife later on. The Zavindar, at the time of conversation, was fishing along with his friends. He sarcastically replied to Nithyananda that if he really needed a piece of land to stay, then he would have to create it out of water. Saying this, the zamindar threw a piece of burning straw into the Ganges in order to mark the place on water where the zamindar decided Lord Nithyananda should set up his residence, making fun of Lord Nithyananda Prabhu in front of his friends. Nithyananda Prabhu, who always remained very humble and without any anger, did not mind the zamindar's harsh words and assured the zamindar that whatever he had wished, though sarcastically, would surely come to pass. What happened next stunned all present. A huge mass of land suddenly appeared from the water exactly at the place where the burning piece of straw had hit it. Then this newly created island then got connected with the mainland. This place subsequently came to be known as Kardaha. Kar means straw in Bengali.

**Summary:** The speaker describes Kunjavatika and the story of Abhirama Thakur's powerful blessings and Nityananda Prabhu's fear for his son Bhirachandra.

His transcendental house is presently renovated all over the three worlds as Kunjavatika. There is a very sweet pastime that has been narrated in Abhirama Leelamrita which talks of Shri Abhirama Gopala Thakura's arrival in Kardaha. Shri Abhirama Gopal Thakur, one of the most prominent of the twelve cowherd boys, Dwaadasha Gopala, had a very powerful personality. He was a great friend of an intimate associate of Shri Nithyananda Prabhu. If Abhirama Thakur bowed down to any person who was not the Lord or empowered by the Lord, then that person would die immediately. Similarly, if he bowed down before any stone that was not a Saligramshila, then that stone would immediately crack. Several deities in Bengal had cracked just because Shri Abhirama had paid them his obeisances. All the previous seven sons of Nithyananda Prabhu had died because Sri Abhirama Thakur had paid them his dhandavats. However, when Sri Bhirachand Prabhu appeared in this world, Lord Nithya was very careful not to invite Sri Abhirama Gopal Thakur to attend his childbirth ceremony. He feared that Abhirama would again bow down and cause harm to the child. Though Lord Nithya was an expansion of the Supreme Lord, yet he played his part like a normal father and therefore expressed his concern and anguish. Nithyananda

**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Abhirama Thakur, describing his miraculous crossing of the Ganges and his eventual blessing of Bhirachandra.

Hence, he instructed all the boatsmen of Kardaha not to transport Abhirama Thakur to the other side of Ganges in case he was seen that day. Sri Abhirama Gopal was a covert boy of Vrindavan and he neither had any ego, nor did he care for any false prestige. In a very innocent mood, living behind all inhibitions, he set out for Kardaha without any invitation to meet his dear friend and bless his newborn. When Abhirama Thakur arrived on the bank of Ganges and asked the boatmen to carry him to Kardaha, the boatmen panicked. Running out of options, they drowned their boats in the water. But Abhirama then simply spread his grace and said, and then, sitting on that floating cloth, peacefully crossed over the river. Seeing his prowess, all the onlookers were amazed. When Abhirama finally arrived at Kunjavatika, Nithyananda Prabhu courteously embraced him and fed him sumptuously. Thereafter, in spite of Srimati Janava and Vasudha Devi's presence, Abhirama bowed down again and paid his obeisances to little Birchandra. When he saw that no harm was caused to the little child, he was overjoyed and composed verses glorifying him, understanding that he was the expansion of the Supreme Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by glorifying Nityananda Prabhu's magnanimity, ecstatic love, and the pastimes performed in Kardaha.

In an innocent mood, he sang and danced in ecstasy. Thus, Sri Birchandra Prabhu had displayed the exalted symptoms of divinity since his very birth. Sri Nithyananda Prabhu had performed the most amazing pastimes here in Kardaha, which cannot be completely described even with a thousand mouths. Such was his magnanimity, such was his mood, that he freely distributed the treasure of Lord's love. His uncommon, unique pastime moved even the atheist to cry tears of love. Lord Nithya was almost completely devoid of any external consciousness and remained intoxicated in an ecstatic love of God. In such a state of utter ecstasy, he would sometimes jump high up in the air or at other times roll over the ground while continuously glorifying the Supreme Lord. Sometimes he would laugh and at other times streams of tears would roll down his beautiful eyes. Srimati Janava Devi, Vasudha Devi, and Birchandra Prabhu have all manifested their sweet pastimes.

**Summary:** The speaker establishes Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead from birth, contrasting this with modern, self-proclaimed incarnations.

OM NAMO BADRAVATE VASUDEVAYA Reading from Srimad-Bhagavatam, 10-1, Chapter 1, Text No. 20 TRITVANTI LAKARMANI SAHARAMENA KESAVA ATIMARTYANI BADRAVAN GRUDA TRAPATAP MANUSAH Lord Shri Krishna, the personality of broadhead, along with Balram, played like a human being, and so must he perform. Many superhuman acts. The doctrines of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism are never applicable to Shri Krishna or the personality of broadhead. The theory that a man becomes broad by dint of penance and austerities is wrong. The theory that a man becomes broad is very much rampant nowadays, especially in India. Since Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, and Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were detected by the sages and saints to be the personality of broadhead, as indicated in revealed scriptures, many unscrupulous men have created their own incarnations. This process of contracting an incarnation of God has become an ordinary business, especially in Bengal. Any popular personality with a few traits of mystic powers will displace some feet of jugglery and easily become an incarnation of God by popular vote. Lord Shri Krishna was not that type of incarnation. He was actually the personality of broadhead from the very beginning of his appearance. He appeared before his so-called mother, as four-armed Vishnu. Then, at the request of the mother, he became like a human child and at once left her for another devotee at Grotul, where he was accepted as the son of Nanda Maharaj and Yasoda Mata. Similarly, Shri Baladeva, the counterpart of Lord Shri Krishna, was also considered a human child, born of the mother of Lord Krishna. He was also considered a human child, born of the mother of Lord Krishna. He was also considered a human child,

**Summary:** Knowing Krishna's transcendental nature leads to liberation, as described in the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam.

born of another wife of Shri Vasudeva. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says that his birth and deeds are transcendental and that anyone who is so fortunate as to know the transcendental nature of his birth and deeds will at once become liberated and eligible to return to the kingdom of God. So, knowledge of the transcendental nature of the birth and deeds of Lord Shri Krishna is sufficient for liberation. In Bhagavatam, the transcendental nature of the Lord is described in nine cantos and in the tenth canto, his specific pastimes are taken up. All this becomes known as one's reading of this literature progresses. It is important to note here, however, that the Lord exhibited his divinity even from the lap of his mother, that his deeds were all superhuman, that he lifted the Jordan Hill at the age of seven, and that all these acts definitely prove him to be actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet, due to his mystic reverence, he was always accepted as an ordinary human child by his so-called father and mother and other relatives. Whenever some Herculean task was performed by him, they did not accept it otherwise, and they remained satisfied with unflinching filial love for their son. As such, the sage of Naimisaranya described him as apparently resembling a human being, but actually, he is the Supreme,

So, Romashana was supposed to do that, but however, Romashana was killed by Balarama, because he was quite proud of his knowledge, and he did not respect Balarama. Then his son, Suta, was told, because Suta heard from Sukadeva Goswami, the whole Bhagavatam which was narrated. So he was selected to speak.

**Key Quote:** "Brahma has concluded that Ishvara is Paramakrishna. Ishvara is Krishna and he has Sat Chit Ananda Vigraha."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's form is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss, contrasting it with the limitations of the material body.

Krishna conscious life, in small small realizations which we have, cannot be different from the conclusions of these personalities. Brahma has concluded that Ishvara is Paramakrishna. Ishvara is Krishna and he has Sat Chit Ananda Vigraha. He has a form which is not material but which is Sat, Chit and Ananda, which is eternal, which is full of knowledge and which is full of Ananda, irrespective of what form he takes, because the form is unlimited, it has all the potencies, so he can take any form and all the forms he take is Sat, it's eternal, it's full of knowledge, awareness of everything and it is blissful. Unlike our body, which is full of blood, pus, mucus, all kinds of liquids flowing inside the body which we don't have any idea of, all kinds of different instruments which is pumping, which is beating, which is cleaning, which you have no idea about, which if you don't take care of it will rot. As soon as a soul leaves the body, it will rot. As soon as a soul leaves the body, it will rot. As soon as a soul leaves the body, it will rot. it rots while the soul is in the body and when the body is functioning also it has no ananda it has no bliss we have all these limitations so to understand the difference between our body and the body of the Lord is the first level of

**Key Quote:** "So these group came up which stopped talking about all these mythological story or just saying that all these are stories"
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the rise of impersonalism through the Arya Samaj movement, which rejected the personal form of the Lord and dismissed Puranic stories.

Krishna consciousness because in modern days especially from the time of Arya Samaj Arya Samaj was formed the Britishers time by those intellectual Hindus who did not want to because the Britishers are always belittling Vedas all the points in Vedas are just stories are just to teach some discipline to the human beings it does not have any reality so that was a conclusion so all these learned Indians who are learned in all the British schools and from these British teachers they want to say that yes it is correct but there is some point in that and what is the point they accepted the impersonal form which is described in the Vedas word jugglery philosophical word jugglery but denying the form of the Lord so these group came up which stopped talking about all these mythological story or just saying that all these are stories in bhakti Siddhanta's time everybody thought all this starting with the Arya Samaj people that Puranas have no value Vedas and Upanishads have any that was a conclusion just to equalize themselves with the with the learned and you know so-called educated class of people we are also educated we also accept all the modern things but Lord is there but he is not having any form don't be bewildered by all the stories all these stories are just for children all these stories of Krishna Vishnu Narasimha Varaha how can a human being how can a God take the form of tortoise there's no other work about tortoise fish bore very boring half-lion half-man what is all these things half-man and half-beard hallucination of some people.

#### Bhakti, Vedas, Shudra mentality, Exploitation

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because the Shudra mentality is always exploitation."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why the Vedas were traditionally kept from those with a 'Shudra mentality' due to their tendency to exploit knowledge for selfish purposes.

So they they were educated class they said there are stories for children just to teach them good habits, teach them this Lord, teach them some principles, moral principles in life. But Lord is Nirananda, the supreme Brahman as explained in Vedas and Upanishads. So they totally swung to one side giving a Purana and Bhaktisiddhanta had a tough time to establish that Puranas. Purana is the oldest. Puranas are older than Vedas or older than Upanishad. And they had to write commentaries on different Upanishads to conclude Bhakti as a supreme. Vedas do talk of Bhakti but it is very covered. Why is it covered? Because in the creation itself they don't want unintelligent Shudra mentality people to understand the supreme Lord. Why? Because the Shudra mentality is always exploitation. Brahmanical quality is always doubt-telling. These are the two qualities you see in the material. Either I exploit everything for my sense gratification or I can utilize it. So a devotee, a Vaishnava, his qualification is that he utilizes things for the supreme. That is what is called supreme Lord. Just like a son he will utilize all the riches of the father to increase the business of the father. But a bad son he would exploit everything and waste everything. So these are the two classes of people. So when the Shudra mentality people understand the Vedas, they will exploit it. Hence the Vedas were always kept away from them not because they were not qualified... not because they were not equally qualified to learn from them, but because they were not qualified enough to learn from them.

**Key Quote:** "And the Vedic Shastras are such that only if you accept an authority you would get the knowledge."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Vedic principle of accepting authority with the modern 'Shudra mentality' that rejects any form of subservience.

but they are not qualified in their character in their Brahmanical qualities in their quality of surrender when you don't have the quality of surrender then you would exploit even the Vedic knowledge so the Brahmanical people they would learn this but the Supreme Lord's position in the Vedas is very very covered kuhyam it is covered and kept and the Upanishads which are supplemented to the Vedas are experiential knowledge of the great rishis so Upanishads are all written with great sages but they have expounded Bhakti in that but these rationalist people they kept it aside and they thought Vedas and Upanishads are great where there is form of the Lord is not given but we all know great Upanishads Manduk Upanishad all the issue Upanishad these Upanishads give the form of the Lord in fact the Upanishad says the Lord is an autocratic person that he will give Bhakti to only person who is totally dedicated and whose favored by the Lord and the Lord can favor anybody and anybody he wants no qualities no qualification if the Lord wants he will come for Bhakti on that person he does not look for any other qualification is an autocrat not to accept autocratic position of the Lord Sudra and Mantra will not work. We are all having Shudra mentality. Shudra mentality means I don't want to be subservient. Rather Shudras are the modern world, not the old Shudras. Old Shudras are subservient. But the modern Shudras are intelligent Shudras, educated Shudras. Educated Shudras means I don't want any boss. I am the Lord. So the Shudra mentality cannot accept an authority.

#### Humility, Krishna's indifference, Popularity, Truth

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The Lord is a person who doesn't care that he is a Lord. He doesn't care if you accept me as God or not, because I am God."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Krishna's indifference to being recognized as God with the desire of human 'lords' to control and manipulate, and discusses the difference between truth and purchased popularity.

And the Vedic Shastras are such that only if you accept an authority you would get the knowledge. This is contradictory. I don't want to accept a Lord, I don't want to accept a leader, but I want to know who is God. That is not possible. The process of understanding Lord is to be humble, subservient, surrender, serve, then earn the mercy and you get the Lord. Because permanently a living entity is subservient. Sub-servient. Sub-servient. Constitutionally living entity is subservient. So the modern age people can never accept Lord Krishna, Lord Balaram as the Supreme Lord. And the Lord doesn't care. There is a Lord. There are so many Lords in this material world. They care a lot that they are Lords. The Lord is a person who doesn't care that he is a Lord. He doesn't care if you accept me as God or not, because I am God. But the modern Gods like us, we want to show that I am Lord, so I control people, I manipulate. That is politics. Human Lords want to show that they are Lord and they will do anything and everything to conclude they are Lord. They will advertise. But Krishna doesn't advertise. Krishna can turn the mind of everybody and all newspapers will say, yes, Krishna is the Supreme Lord. All newspapers, same as people accept. The Lord does not look for popularity. So when truth is there, popularity may not be there. And many people want to accept truth, which is very popular. And that is a problem in modern age. That person who is most popular must be the right person. But the popularity of this material world is purchased popularity.

**Key Quote:** "So the latest trip is to call oneself Guru. That is the latest trip. I can't call myself Bhagavan."
**Summary:** The speaker critiques the modern trend of self-proclaimed gurus who prioritize popularity over scriptural truth.

Either with money or with one's karma. If you are karmically very, very strong person, you will be popular. But just because you are popular doesn't mean that you are Lord. In olden days, like in 70s, 80s, 90s, the biggest trip was for people to say he is Bhagavan. This Bhagavan, that Bhagavan, so many Bhagavans had in Prabhupada's time. So Prabhupada explains, people want to be Bhagavan. Why? Small, small trickery. Small tricks or mysticism. Maybe mystic or mostly it is trick. 99% is trick. Create ash, useless stuff. And people call him Bhagavan. But modern days, people have understood. Human beings are not fools. So I cannot call myself Bhagavan. So the latest trip is to call oneself Guru. That is the latest trip. I can't call myself Bhagavan. Out of question. Because people, if not fool people. Not only that, I don't even have karma to create basma, to create ash. At least those Bhagavans had some power to create ash. The modern Bhagavans don't have power to create ash. So they have stopped talking about themselves to be Bhagavan. But they are all pure Gurus. Why? Popularity. Then you can become popular. And you talk what people want to listen to. You don't talk what people want to listen to. You don't talk what people want to listen to. You don't talk what people want to listen to. You don't talk what people want to listen to. And you're not going to be popular. You'll be biased because you're not getting what Shastras say. In fact they say don't read Shastra. Because you'll be contaminated by Shastra. You'll be biased. You have to create knowledge on your own. Doesn't matter what stupid things they are talking. So this is the modern. So gullible people, they get

Not only in the modern age, there was a period of Duryodhanas and Karna. who never accepted Krishna many sages Narada Vyasa Bhishma all these people went and told Duryodhana and Dhritarashtra do you know who this Krishna is do you know whom you are playing with whom are you trying to be against because Duryodhana had one idea if I catch Krishna then Pandavas are won over because if you catch Krishna what will Pandavas do they'll come running and say whatever you want to take leave Krishna right Pandavas are so attached to Krishna Yudhishthira Arjuna Bhima these people say you want the kingdom you want to kill us do whatever you want so Duryodhana knew the position of Krishna as dear to Pandavas and he always wanted to capture Krishna because he thought Krishna yes he is great but not God he's a mystic person but my mysticism is more than his so if I capture him if I tie him when he comes for peace he's coming for peace talks he's a great Chalu person he'll have some ideas if I capture him then I won no war so these Duryodhanas and Dhritarashtras thought Krishna is ordinary so all these knowledgeable sages told him don't play with Krishna and they showed so many stories how he and Arjuna are great personalities you cannot win over them Krishna is none other than Narayana Arjuna is none other than Nara they are the original Nara and Narayana mystical great mystic personalities the supreme person having all the controls and they told so many stories about how great great kings proud kings wanted to fight there is a king who wanted to want to fight everybody in this world and finally as sages told why are you so puffed up you really want to fight with equals go and fight with Nara Narayana where is he found he is in Badrikashyam go and fight with him he went all the way to Badrikashyam to fight and Narayana said we have no time we are busy no I don't need to fight everybody sages all the sages say that you are the right person to fight Nara Narayana was meditating and they created all huge army of people and this king was shit scared and he wouldn't fight at least he surrendered at last so there are great kings like this even bigger kings than you Duryodhana who have realized the position of Nara and Narayana and surrendered to them you also surrender to them. At least he surrendered. you'll benefit but asurik mentality shudra mentality is such that the anger and the ego takes over and they don't want to surrender

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the realization of great sages regarding Krishna's supremacy and the necessity of surrendering to Him for our well-being.

so Krishna came for peace deal Krishna came Mahabharata explains the whole way how Krishna appeared in the great assembly huge assembly of all great kings and all the sages also came to hear what Krishna is going to say just like we send a mobile message and everybody comes but the sages don't need any mobile messages they all know when is the right time then the Lord will speak when to go and hear him they're all mystic understanding with some modern people who have no idea because for them space is an empty space but space is full of essence energy which has all the subtle energies in it so this great sages use all these methods to hear and understand what is happening in this world what is the latest avatar are doing when is the latest avatar are speaking when the Lord comes when does he speak so they are all interested in hearing the Lord so these great personalities realize a lot not because they are fools not because they are gullible because they have establish the truth that Krishna is the supreme Lord through their experiences in their life they have realized that human body is so limited human life is so limited we cannot anyway become God but our nature is such is Ananda we have a rightful position to be happy but we're looking for happiness in the wrong direction they have realized that they have gone in for happiness in the wrong direction they have realized that they have gone in said themselves and meditated and they have realized the vedic truth and that is upanishad realized vedic knowledge is upanishad but puranas are hitihasas which are historical narrations of the supreme lord which is given in puranas so the gaudiya vaishnavas they have worked hard to put purana and among puranas bhagavatam as the most important purana which is actual truth which talks and reveals the truth they are not stories whatever is told in purana the historical narrations and all these people have realized supreme lord krishna who is enacting like a human being whether illiterate people like devaki or or or the mother of pandavas kuntidevi or learned personalities like bhisma or great sages as as vyasa narada devala asita doesn't matter who they are from simple people to most intelligent class of people who have concluded krishna is a supreme personality of godhead and we are part and parcel of him and our our goodness or our safety is in surrendering to him

**Summary:** The speaker explains that bhakti reveals itself and is self-sustaining, starting with faith (sraddha).

so these are concluded by the great sages by their experiences so bhakti reveals bhakti itself we need to start bhakti when we start a little bit of bhakti more bhakti is revealed and we do when we do that more bhakti another more bhakti is is established in the heart so bhakti establishes bhakti but we need to start and where do we start with sraddha with faith if this sraddha is not there then we cannot start we are this we have to start the car unless the car started it won't move so starting process is having a little bit of faith so we are people who have got that little faith and we have surrendered to krishna now we need to fan that faith and make it convert into shuddha bhakti and once you get bhakti bhakti is self-sustained bhakti sustains bhakti there's no question of outside push needed to get bhakti now we are pushing ourselves so many things to get bhakti so much of struggle bodily struggle mental struggle push from others so many so many requirements are there for us to do bhakti because bhakti is very very kumala but this kumala bhakti once it is fanned it becomes very very strong so we don't need anything else

**Summary:** The speaker explains that self-importance hinders the growth of bhakti, and that surrender is impossible when we identify with our ego and mind.

bhakti can sustain itself example is given like a person who is eating a person who is hungry and is eating he feels satisfaction on his own you go and ask him you're satisfied yes how do you know you're satisfied no i know i'm satisfied but how do you know you're satisfied i'm satisfied bhakti is like that once again bhakti you're satisfied by itself so bhakti has this tendency it provides more bhakti and it sustains itself so these great personalities have done that and that is what we need to do but we need to fan the bhakti we are not able to fan the bhakti because we are giving importance to ourselves ourself when you say we are not giving importance to the soul if we are giving importance to the soul then that becomes our own self interest and that is needed but when we don't know who you we are when we think i am my intelligence when i think i am my ego where i have my priorities when i think that i am a mind which has his preferences and non-preferences then we cannot surrender my ego is important my popularity is important my worship is important my respect is important as long as we go with this thought bhakti will not flourish yeah some spark is there in us but that spark has been converted always example is given bhakti with this story of making we always say making of this jaggery good if these malas are not removed bhakti does not become pure just like when you make when you make candy you have to remove all the mucks which is coming out otherwise candy will not be pure candy it will be filled with dust so our bhakti is filled with dust

#### Anarthas, False identification, Supreme Lord's pleasure, Real Bhakti

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But real bhakti means I do it because Krishna is pleased. The more I do, Krishna is pleased."
**Summary:** The speaker describes the various false identifications that prevent pure bhakti, emphasizing that real bhakti is performed for Krishna's pleasure, not for self-gratification.

why because we have not removed all these anarthas mother matsadiyah puja pratishta lava i am woman i am man i am wife i am husband i am thin i am thick i am powerful i am weak powerful has a pr has a pride being proud and the weak people have the depression that they are weak. Both are wrong. Right? Self-pitying is also sense gratification. Well, you are not that. You are not that mind which is depressed. Nor are you that mind which is very powerful. So unless we realize that we are simple souls supposed to surrender to the Lord, perform our Bhakti Yuga without any kind of comparison of importance, identifying the mistakes in others, glorifying the small goodness in oneself, this is our time. When we do Bhakti, when we do Seva, we are not thinking of the Supreme Lord's pleasure. We are supposed to think of the Supreme Lord's pleasure, I'm washing a pot, I'm making a garland, I am cleaning a place. I am thinking about my importance. Or I am thinking about the weakness of others. Oh, he doesn't do properly. He is very proud. He is puffed up. He is not surrendered. He doesn't do anything properly. I do everything very nice. But I am doing it with this consciousness. But real bhakti means I do it because Krishna is pleased. The more I do, Krishna is pleased. I am tying a garland for Krishna. I am cleaning a place. I am preaching to somebody. So, whenever we do bhakti, more bhakti is not coming. Because we are shutting the door with our importance. So, with that mentality, we cannot understand Krishna.

#### Popularity, Truth, Bhagavatam, Gaudiya Vaishnavas

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "But a self-realized person is he who sides with truth always. Whether the truth is popular or not popular."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts siding with popularity versus siding with truth, highlighting that Bhagavatam and Gaudiya Vaishnavas prioritize truth over popularity.

Today we are understanding Krishna because Krishna is very popular. ISKCON has made Krishna very popular. So, I also want to be a devotee in ISKCON. Tomorrow, when there are thousands of newspapers talking bad of ISKCON. No, no, no. I don't go to ISKCON. Before I used to go. Now, I don't go. We always want to side with which is advantageous. We don't want to side with truth. But a self-realized person is he who sides with truth always. Whether the truth is popular or not popular. Whether it is accepted by thousands or not accepted by anybody. Truth is truth. And that is what Bhagavatam is. Bhagavatam doesn't make us gullible and weak to side with what is popular for our safety. Bhagavatam does not look about human safety. It looks about the position of the Supreme Lord. Hence, Gaudiya Vaishnava always positioned Krishna in his right form. Free from all malas, free from all material tinges. That is the beauty of Bhagavatam number one. And the beauty of Gaudiya Vaishnava is such that they don't compromise for their name, fame. When we start, especially big institutions like us, when we become too conscious of the public popularity, truth will be given second position. And Gaudiya Vaishnavas don't do that. Truth is always first. Whether you are popular, whether you are accepted, whether people are throwing stones or people are throwing flowers. Everybody wants to get flowers thrown at. Nobody wants stones to be thrown at. But truth will not hide when stones are thrown. So Bhagavatam makes us very confident that Krishna is the Supreme Lord. He is the conclusion. He is the person to whom we have to surrender. And that is of our benefit.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of unwavering faith in Krishna's supremacy, regardless of changing public opinion.

Doesn't matter materially what is the position. As ages go by, sometimes some are popular, sometimes some are not popular. In the beginning days of ISKCON, we were never popular. As soon as anybody sees devotees, they only say Dhammarodham. Right? So you are going to ISKCON what? You get ganja there? There is a time when okay, this has become very popular. When you are popular, many people want to side. But when something negative comes, how many of us will stand? With Bhagavatam. Some great person comes and talks against Krishna, will you change your mind? Bhagavatam gives us the strength not to change the mind. Bhagavatam gives us the strength that Krishna is absolute. This is practical. This is practically experienced knowledge. So we don't want anybody to say Krishna is right or wrong. We don't want anybody to say Krishna is right or wrong. We don't want anybody to say Krishna is right or wrong. We have to show magic. So we need to grow in our Bhakti, in our faith in such a way that we don't get shaken by different popular bitter sayings or theories at different times. Every 50 years or every 30 years opinions change, public opinion changes. Devotees don't go by the change in public opinion. They only have one opinion.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that absolute knowledge is realized by prioritizing Vaishnavas, Guru, and Krishna above oneself.

And we have just been there for thousands and thousands of years, millions and millions of years. millennium five years back Chaitanya Mahaprabhu established five thousand years Krishna established and thousands and thousands of years before sages have established Krishna is a supreme person. Ekala Eeshwara Krishna Aarasa Babhratiya so that knowledge is absolute knowledge other knowledges are all relative knowledge which changes according to taste and if you say why we are not getting that confidence why we are not getting that that absolute truth in us as established or realized and we determined to follow it properly it because of our own weakness and the weakness is only one thing we put ourselves first what our situation comes we put ourselves first we don't put guru and Krishna first not guru we have to put Vaishnava's guru and Krishna first oh I'll put Krishna first always I have no other way he is first okay I take a Diksha I'll put guru also first no no doubt of choice I had to go through guru. Vaishnava's I can't put Vaishnava's first why my ego doesn't allow my self-importance doesn't allow but bhakti is such that only when we put Vaishnava's guru and Krishna first we get bhakti so this is something which has to be practiced. So this is something which has to be practiced. So this is something which has to be practiced. done in our day-to-day life then bhakti becomes fixed real bhakti becomes fixed in our heart so this is Bhagavatam's conclusion and this is

**Summary:** The speaker addresses the common misconception of seeking personal happiness in Krishna consciousness, emphasizing that true fulfillment comes from serving Krishna's satisfaction.

Hare Krishna we mainly come to ISKCON for our happiness but now as you said we have to satisfy guru and Krishna the cat is out we come to Krishna for our happiness we come to go to temple for our happiness that is the first thing you have to understand we are not coming here for our happiness and you're with thanks for being very honest because 99% of the people come for this and that is where they get dejected that is why they get hit we get hit when we come for our happiness we never get hit when we come for Krishna's happiness so it's the most important point we have to come to Krishna Krishna consciousness for give me happiness to Krishna Rishikesh Rishikesh seven we understand that he is a master of the senses and we had to understand that our senses are for his satisfaction otherwise it is becoming Ulta I am the God and he is a servant I either God is being very happy people come with lot of desires to the temple and the primary motive of this desires are nothing but self-centered benefit happiness popularity importance whatever it is and that leads to frustration and that stops our bhakti but when we come to Krishna consciousness I am here for you lot you use me which way you want

because of the understand the it is coming is springing from the understanding that going to temple is for happiness because I'm the house I'm always unhappy at least out of the house I'm happy Ulta olden days how how suppose we happy place the happiest person is he who has no loans happiest person is he who eats his food in his house but nowadays happiest person is he who eats in big restaurants happiest person is he who's full of loans and avoids paying back result so we come to the temple the understanding is oh I'll be happy I'm all my problems would be gone that is not the real case that is a byproduct being happy once I was a byproduct because we are part and parcel of Krishna when the root is sufficiently nourished all the parts of the tree become nourished same way when the Supreme Lord the Supreme person Poorna person is made happy we the subse these parts and parcels automatically becomes happy that is a proper understanding so people bring things people give money I'll give money if I my name is put in 10 inches bold right I brought Carlin today and the Witcher he did not put it on the Lord I'm so unhappy why because I I wanted to see my my mala on the Lord and feel oh my mala is there my mala is there mala is very beautiful because of me the dress I stitch because I stitch is very beautiful oh the Pujari did not put the put the dress which I gave oh temple did not use a sari which I give my work is to give Lord wants he will wear it I guess today we heard the story of Jagannath world wants evill he will take the worst of the Lotus putrefied flower also because he is not seeing the flower he is not saying how beautiful dress you stitch he He is not seeing how much flowers he bought, how many rupees he gave, what he gave, what vehicle he gave temple, what material he gave temple. He is seeing what was behind that. Bhava grahi janatana. He is always bhava grahi janatana. He only wants the bhava in which you are doing it. He does not want really what you do it. He will accept it. But that is not what he is really looking at. He is looking with what bhava did you say. With what bhava are you preaching? Are you preaching to become a guru? Or are you preaching to glorify me, the Lord? Are you doing this service for self-respect and position and name and fame? Or are you doing it to please me? So, Lord does not change. He is only looking for bhava. So, we have to understand that.

#### Lord as the Center, Object vs. Subject, Surrender, Bhakti

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When you make the Lord the center, you are the object and the subject."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the importance of making the Lord the center of our lives, understanding that we are the object of His attention and service.

We are here to serve him. We do not want him to serve. There are two concepts. One is I am the center and other is the Lord is the center. When you make the Lord the center, you are the object and the subject. We go to the temple thinking that we are the object. We are the subject. We think Lord is the object. Lord is not the object. You are the object. Or we are the object. Lord is seeing you. The Lord is seeing what you are doing. The Lord is seeing how you are doing. Ours is ulta. I go and see the Lord. I do for the Lord. So, that is different. So, when I make the Lord the center and I am the object of the Lord. The Lord is seeing me. So, our pleasure, our happiness is automatic. It is naturally there. It is automatic. But when we go only for our sake to the temple, we go for our sake to the organization, then we can get disappointed. Many times this is what happens. In the beginning, we are very enthusiastic. Later on, we are not enthusiastic because we put ourselves first. So, if you experience this, put yourself last and see. Nothing will happen. Your foot will come. Your life will go on. But the mind will fight. And that is the internal fight which we need to do with Shastra, with the knowledge, with Bhagavatam, with Gita, with the slokas. To remind ourselves that how I am the last. I am not the actual important person. The Lord is. So, entire Krishna conscious life is nothing but this. How we can put others in the front and ourselves last. And that is what the Lord wants. And such a person, Bhakti becomes flourishing in his heart. Bhakti becomes flourishing in his heart. Bhakti becomes flourishing in his heart.

**Key Quote:** "We are not here to come to ask. We are here to give."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of giving to Krishna, rather than asking for personal benefits, and discusses the love inherent in the Lord's chastisement.

Otherwise, we always ask, what will you do? What will I get? Same thing. What will I get? If I give one rupee, what will I get? If I come to Krishna and say, what will I get? You won't get anything. Rather, he will take everything that you have. But if you tell that, nobody will come. So, yes, in the beginning, we may preach, come, take nice prasadam, you are taken care of, etc, etc. Because of my weakness. Rupa Goswami is always sad. Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami are always sad. Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami are always sad. Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami are always sad. Why is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu giving us importance? Chaitanya Mahaprabhu always criticizes and fires that person, the old person, who gives sandal to Lord Chaitanya, the older personality. Forget his name. So, he chastises us. So, Rupa Goswami knew, we are not able to take the chastisement of the Lord. That is why the Lord is very careful with us. That is why the Lord is very careful with us. He understood the point. Because only when you are loved you are chastised. The liberty of chastisement is only when you are loved. But we cannot take it. We cannot see that love in chastisement. So, Rupa Goswami is always, why are you giving us importance? Because we are not surrendered. When you are surrendered, you give up yourself to the Lord and you don't care whether the Lord is glorifying you or the Lord is chastising you. For you, the Lord is glorifying you. is Lord, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu prayers himself. Whether you accept me or you don't accept me, you embrace me or you kick me away, you are always my love. So that is the conclusion of bhakti. So very important point, as we said, we need to come here

#### Giving, Enjoyment, Krishna's Pleasure, Achintya Bheda Abheda Tattva

**Key Quote:** "So our purpose is to come to Krishna to see what I can give, not what I can take."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of giving to Krishna and seeking His pleasure, explaining that true enjoyment comes from being part of Krishna's enjoyment.

to give. Not only people who come here, people who stay here also. People who stay here also have to be giving only. We cannot be receiving. So when we are always giving ourselves to the Lord, we are given the life, people who are inside the temple are given the life. But every day we are carrying out our life. So that doesn't grow, then bhakti doesn't grow. And people who come to the temple from outside have to come with the mentality of giving and not taking back. Taking back subtle happiness, subtle pleasure. I'm giving money. So in one sense I'm charity. I'm giving away one lakh rupees. My bank balance is less by one lakh. I'm giving it. For what? To get name, fame. He is a great congregation devotee. He always gives. Tomorrow another rich man will come richer than you and he will give more. Then you will be sad because my number is gone. But if I was giving to Krishna, not because of earning something from him, then I'll always be happy. So our purpose is to come to Krishna to see what I can give, not what I can take. This is a core misunderstanding we all have. Sometimes many years it takes to understand this. But that's the crux of the point. Chanting Hare Krishna is not for my happiness. Chanting Hare Krishna is for Krishna's happiness. Krishna likes to hear his name. Krishna gives himself up to those people who chant his name purely. Krishna is my next. So the enjoying tendency should only be in Krishna. Because he is the only person who can enjoy. How can a part enjoy? If this finger is thinking that I want to enjoy, it's impossible. It's very unnatural for it. The whole body, the person has to enjoy. Same way the whole body of this universe is Krishna. We are all part and parcel. He can think of enjoyment. Part cannot think of enjoyment. This is, I think, in Mahaprabhu's Achintya Veda, Abheda Tattva, which is a final conclusion. A part cannot think of enjoyment. Only the whole can enjoy. Part can enjoy by being part of enjoyment of the whole.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of surrender and giving in Krishna consciousness, and seeking the association of those who speak the truth.

So we always enjoy Prasadam, mercy of the Lord. So in all our activities if we have that in mind, we will always be happy in Krishna consciousness. No matter what happens. So everything is Krishna. We are looking for justice. But we don't understand what are the injustices I did in this world. But from the Lord's point, everything is very just. In your temple, nothing is good. Nobody takes care of me. Nobody gives me Prasadam. I will not come to the temple. Good if you don't come. One problem less. Right? Who is the loser? The Lord doesn't lose anything. The Lord will be sad. The Lord will be angry at the devotees in the temple. Why didn't you make the person come? The Lord will be angry at the devotees in the temple if you don't give the real knowledge to the people. What is the real knowledge? The real knowledge is surrender. Not ask. Give. We are not here to come to ask. We are here to give. And if you are always asking, then we are not teaching you the right thing. But everybody cannot listen to this. Everybody cannot understand. Because if you are always asking, then we are not teaching you the right thing. You cannot understand. Because to understand, this takes time. So these subject matters are not always talked about. But if you really want to know the subject matter of Krishna Consciousness, you have to surrender and you have to pray and you have to earn for the association of those people who talk truth. Despite any adverse. So this is the truth we are talking about in Krishna Consciousness. Right? Okay. Khanderaashimad Bhagavatam Ki. Srila Prabhupada Ki. Satsang with Mooji

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Now you have free will. How to respond to your subtle body, your gross body and your kala."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the question of destiny versus choice, explaining that while external factors are governed by karma, the soul has free will to respond to them.

If everything that happens to us is due to past karma, is becoming a devotee also predetermined by it? No, even if everything that happens to us, what happens to us, that means what the environment, what everything outside me does to me, what I am there outside me, I am the outside, outside me means my body, my mind, and the world outside. Everything is outside me. I am not the body. I am sitting in the body. So, my mind, my intelligence, my ego, everything is outside me. My real ego is different. Soul's real ego is outside me. Now, dormant. So now there is a subtle body and the gross body. Soul is there, then subtle body is there, then gross body is there and the world is there. So, the subtle body, the gross body and the world it will interact with you. But the soul will not. It will not interact with you. You are there in this world. You belong in this world. I am saying this according to your past karma, governed by Krishna's impersonal aspect called kala, kala shakti. Kala shakti through according to your karma is predestining you. You. You means the soul. Now you have free will. How to respond to your subtle body, your gross body and your kala.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Even a dog has a free will."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of interacting with a dog to illustrate that even animals have free will to react to their environment, suggesting life is a combination of free will and destiny.

So, you have free will. Now you have free will. How to respond to your subtle body, than the outside world. But how much you can change, how much you can, that depends on like two forces are there. If your force is big, then you will counter it. If that force is big, you will counter it. But we always have a choice, we always have a choice. What to speak of we having the choice? Today I was walking and opposite side one dog was coming. So I was first trying to give way to the dog this way. Then the dog went that way. Then I tried to give dog way this way. I went that side. The dog changed this way. Then again I changed. So as much as I was changing, even a dog has a free will. Even the dog is at that time is waiting for me whether I will go this way or this way. So I can see the dog is ready to finally go this way or that way. That means even a dog has free will. I can force, you don't go this way, I will block it. He will go that way. He will use his free will to go that way. If I go this way, that means according to the way the environment is impacting you, you have got a free will to go this way or that way.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "My destiny is nothing but my past free will."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that destiny is a result of past free will, not arbitrary divine intervention, and uses the analogy of a cow tied to a tree to illustrate the limits and freedom within destiny.

So life is a combination of free will and destiny. Free will and destiny. If you say everything is distinct, that destiny, whatever destiny has come, it will come. Whatever is distinct, who created that? My own past free will. It is not that God has given, put on destiny for you differently, for him differently out of his whims and fancies. If somebody is a beggar today, he has created his destiny, not God. God has sanctioned that, because nothing will move without God, move without Krishna's sanction. Sanction is different, his wish is different. According to your wish, he sanctions. Wish and karma. I will give a simple example. If a cow is tied around a coconut tree, 100 feet rope. Within 100 feet, rope has any effect? No. Moment it goes beyond 100 feet, it will pull. Destiny is like, cow's destiny is 100 feet rope. Even though he cannot go beyond 100 feet, within 100 feet he can go anywhere. There is no destiny.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So potentially speaking, it is my free will alone that exists. My destiny is nothing but my past free will."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of wanting to fly like a bird to show limitations, and a boil to illustrate how free will can influence the manifestation of karma.

Correct? Let's say I got a, now I am in a human form. I want to fly like a bird. I can see birds are flying. I want to fly like a bird. No. 100 feet rope. You are in a human body, you cannot fly. But within the human body, I got so much freedom. I can go murder somebody. Now you are creating a new rope. So all the destiny that we are, that is putting us here, there, all those things is created by our past. So potentially speaking, it is my free will alone that exists. My destiny is nothing but my past free will. So, what to speak of even material things, material things itself you can go this way, that way, in details, Sukha Dukha is fixed, but you go this way, also this way, just like if you have a boil here, it's your karma. If you take a tablet that boil will go, you don't take a tablet that boil will remain. Now you will say whether the boil was destiny or not. Coming of the boil was destiny or not, going of the boil was destiny or not.

**Key Quote:** "Sukha Dukha, you have created according to your karma, you have to face it."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while the form of suffering may be altered, the underlying karma must be experienced, and reiterates that destiny doesn't dictate every action, using the dog example again.

What will be the answer? The pain, that you have to experience due to this is distinct. If your destiny is that, the Dukha that you have to get because of this is not completed. Even you take medicine, you will get a boil somewhere else or something you will get somewhere else. Sukha Dukha, you have created according to your karma, you have to face it. The shape of that you may be able to change. But in your account you cannot change. Somebody you have given loan, he comes, give my money back. You can tell him, wait, wait. You cannot say I won't give. Right? It is your debt. You can tell him, wait, wait. You cannot say I won't give. In the same way for Papa and Punya that we have done, Sukha and Dukha will come to us. That is destiny. Destiny does not mean that every action is destined. I told you even a dog has got freedom. According to the way I go, it will take a different turn.

**Key Quote:** "The soul is there, acting. He is not a robotic dog."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that even the dog's actions are not purely mechanical, but influenced by the soul's willing, distinguishing it from a robotic response.

It was not destined. It took a decision. Here is somebody coming this side. I should go this side. That means it decided to go that way. Any question on this? Yeah. Limited free will. Sir, it is actually due to the reactions of the horse, it is making its decision and not actually due to the reaction of the dog. Yes. See, for instance, how they, let us not use the word free will, free will. Let us use the word willing. The willing shakti. Dog has got willing shakti. That willing shakti is influenced by the modes. But it is his willing shakti. He is not a machine. He is not a machine. He is influenced by that and therefore he is deciding. The soul is there, acting. He is not a robotic dog. If there is a robotic dog, you can say 100%. There is no willing there. Input, it output, it will decide. But there is an action.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Free will is an illusion in this world... A decision maker is a soul."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that 'free will' is actually 'willing' influenced by the modes of nature, and that true free will exists in the spiritual world through Krishna consciousness.

Experience inside that dog. In a robot dog, there is no experiencer. So the experiencer wills this way or that way. But that is why I said change the word free will. You are right. That free will, that means freely deciding is not there for anybody in the world. They are all influenced by three modes of nature. But we take a decision. Highly influenced. If you say free will, free will is an illusion in this world. You think you are free. But there is a person who is willing. There is an atna who is willing, whether influenced or uninfluenced, less influenced or more influenced. A decision maker is a soul. So I would say, the answer to your question is, dog was exercising his willing, influenced by my going this side or that side. Understood? At the top level, these are all within the field. Willing, all. At the top level, totally uninfluenced by three modes of material nature. Like Prabhupada can purely act at that level. That level is when one has exercised his free will 100% not to forget Krishna and always be Krishna's.

**Key Quote:** "The rope has given you that freedom. 100 feet circle, you can go what you want."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the rope analogy again to illustrate the limited freedom within material existence, emphasizing that desires are not always attainable and that association influences our 'willing'.

That is when our real free will is there in the spiritual world. Free will. Only Krishna has got absolute free will. We think I have got free will. I gave you example of free will. How long is a rope within that, you are free. Doesn't mean you are free forever. You can do what you want. The rope has given you that freedom. 100 feet circle, you can go what you want. As I told, I can, my desires are not, everything cannot. If I want to fly like a bird, I cannot. I am distinct. But here I can walk. I can go here. I can walk to a bar. I can walk to a gambling hall. I can walk to a temple. I can choose. In that I may be influenced. I will be influenced. That is why it says, depends on the association. Association influences your willing. Don't call it free will. Association influences your willing. In a computer, there is nobody sitting and willing.

Without willing, it is, program-wise it is responding. You put something on the screen, it responds. There is no willing there. Willing, only the Jeeva Shakti can will. Yeah, he can be free. I can only be free in that. No willing, only Brandon leave it to the agreement or the agreement to the agreement, what do we call it? In addition, any relation is a request. He cannot stoop this level, what do you call it? Hope of what? Hopelessness. Of course.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how material lust and anger can be purified through engagement in the service of the Lord, leading to freedom from these desires.

So, then how is this lust serving the Lord in the spiritual world? If the order of the Lord is there, He will purify it. Just like Krishna says, "I am sex life according to regulative principles." So, even though, that means it is a compromise. When material lust, material anger, material all these things are engaged in the service of the Lord by a conditioned soul, it gets purified. That means you become free from that lust. You become free from that anger.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the freedom of pure devotees from lust and how divine forces, including sex, can be used to liberate oneself if one understands their true purpose.

You understand? So that is different. A pure devotee's anger, everything is different. Of course, they are free from lust. Even like Bhaktivinoda Thakur says that if I can—but you know, Thakur or Bhaktis is not—but this is not so. If I can bring forth hundreds of pure devotees, I won't mind engaging in sex. Divine forces Krishna has made that to trap the living entities, correct? But if you know the real purpose, you can use that to untrap also.

Bhagavad Gita 13.6.7. Symptoms of life also consist of the field of activity, and in the purport to this verse, Prabhupada writes, "The living symptoms represented by the consciousness and conviction are two manifestations of this subtle body, mind, ego, and intelligence." But doubt comes when we go further in this chapter. Prabhupada writes, "Consciousness as a symptom of the soul." These two statements look contradictory.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of electricity powering a fan or light to explain the relationship between the soul and the body, stating that the soul is the spiritual current that enlivens the body.

It is not. It is even symptoms of life; it is a field of activity. How to identify the knower of the field, the soul? What is the actual clue that there exists something called a soul? I am perturbed, Prabhupada. Please explain. The field of activity, a simple example I will give, based on that you understand. Electricity is driving this fan, electricity is driving this light. Cut off the electricity, everything seems to be there. Yes, the unseen is gone, okay. But I should not mistake electricity with the electrical wire. Electricity is not equal to the bulb, electricity is not equal to the light. A dead electrical wire and a live electrical wire, an electrified wire, is not equal to electricity. Electricity is flowing inside. Therefore, it is alive. Similarly, the kshetra having the symptoms of life because the soul is there, the soul is like

the spiritual current, spirit is there, therefore, this body can think, feel all the symptoms. Just like when the electricity goes, the light goes away. So life is actually alive. It is alive. Actually, originally the sense, light is what, the spirit, it is simply, it is different from the equipment. Similarly, gross body and subtle body, manas, buddhi, ahankara, they are like electrical wire. Then the soul is connected to that. Then electricity is connected to the wire. So, this is the kshetra. This is the kshetra. Then you have the soul. The soul is connected to this kshetra, this body, gross body and subtle body, the symptom of life comes. But the symptom of life is not there if you take it away. A dead man has no symptom of life. So the symptom of life is coming from spirit. But in this world, it is manifest differently. This is the same for the kshetra. The kshetra, it is very different from the earth. A 100-watt bulb will give 100-watt light, a 20-watt will give 20-watt light. So you will mistake that the bulb is a giver of 20 watts. This bulb gives 20 watts, that bulb gives 20 watts, no.

drawing 100 watts. So another example, if they have white light, you put a green glass, green light will come, red light, red will come, blue light, blue will come. Now this filter, is it equal to the light? No. If you don't know there is a source of light behind, you will see, this blue light, Mr. Blue, Mr. Red, Mr. Green, it is just a filter. But it affects the, it modifies the white light. But light is from? Spirit. You understand, matter, ego, mind, intelligence, gross body, none of them will work without the spirit being connected to the soul. So therefore Krishna says, you are Kshetrajna. Kshetrajna. You are the knower, knower means that awareness, that consciousness, but that consciousness

is modified into various effects, conviction, this thing, that thing, different life symptoms. It modifies for different persons, according to different types of bodies. If you have Sattva guna, your conviction will be modified accordingly. You are the knower. If you have Sattva guna, your conviction will be modified in a different way. That doesn't mean that it is the soul's conviction. It doesn't mean that it is the soul's this thing. It is the soul's conviction modified. Matter cannot have conviction. Matter cannot think without the spirit. Manas buddhi ahankara is not manas buddhi ahankara. I'll give you an example of ego. Pure white light is there, it's a little example. You put a lion mask in front of it, transparent, translucent. You go the other side. It's transparent. You go the other side. It's transparent. Translucent. Translucent. You will see the toe is a lion, the foot a monkey face, the toe is a monkey. So what is the mask doing? It is influencing and modifying. This is three gunas. It is modifying. Modifying life symptom, life energy, life modifying life.

**Key Quote:** "The soul is not there then there is nobody, there cannot be ahankara."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the soul is the basis of ego and experience, and that the soul is the experiencer of happiness and distress, even in dreams.

Just like the filter modifies pure light. Green, red, the modifier. It is a mold. The lion's face is a mold. I am the body is a mold. Plus me. I am the one who is associated with the body and saying I am the body. If the soul is not there, then there is nobody, there cannot be ahankara. There cannot be false ego without an ego behind it. You can go to a stage and play the drama role of a king on the stage. But who is playing the role? You. If you are not there then no drama player also. Right. Similarly, we are playing so many false egos. I am this body, everything. Who is this? It is all the soul is doing, but influenced by the material energy. Now we are trying to create pure influence. But whether influenced or uninfluenced, the experiencer of sukha dukkha is who? The soul. Whether in a dream or in real life, the experiencer of sukha dukkha in the story is who? You. In the dream, who is afraid? You only are afraid. Suffering. Who is suffering? Or who is enjoying in the dream? You only.

**Key Quote:** "And the kshetra is a modifier, molder of your experience."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Kshetrajna (knower of the field) is the experiencer, while the Kshetra (field of activity) modifies the experience based on the gunas, and that liberation leads to experience influenced by spiritual nature.

So similarly, we, the kshetrajna is the knower and is the experiencer. And the kshetra is a modifier, a molder of your experience. If your sattva guna body, sattva guna mind, then your experience will be sattvic. If tamasic, then your experience will be tamasic. If you are liberated, then your experience is influenced by the higher nature, spiritual nature, vishuddha sattva. Any question on this? Remind me of my time. Go to the airport. The kshetra, doubt comes or no doubt comes, provisional. Actually, in relation to bhavadeesha and pralpa, our lives, our current consciousness reflects the matter. It has been light, light and death, it has been that. But for now, we have seen everything that matters. But how to, if a person is in darkness, who has never seen light? Then how will that happen, if there is something on his life?

Krishna will show you light, correct? Correct? You are right. Without experience, little by little your faith will not increase. First you intellectually understand that yes, there is light. Intellectually. Intellectually means? I am trying but I did not input anything. No, I am telling you. Intellectually you can understand that I am struggling for permanency. But I see my body, my life, my everything is temporary. So intellectually you see that I am by nature seeking permanency. I don't want to die. I don't want to grow old. Do you want to grow old? Give a choice. One blessing I will give you. Please ask. If you want, I will give you a blessing. What is the blessing? Either I will tell you. You will always remain young or you will grow old. You know it is not possible. Therefore you are saying you don't. Suppose I have that power. You will say, Ajay Prabhu, give me. As long as I live, let me live young. I am not saying you will not die. But you will always be young. Better I am young always. I will take that boon. Nature does not allow. That is all. But what is your inner nature? Nature does not allow.

I am like this. I am like that. All that. I can understand why they gave us this. Yes, I am not this body. I am confusing my body person with the person. Person means spirit. You know the confusion comes more because even when we say I am saying some great thing. How to find the soul? Even now when you are speaking, 99% you are soul only. Only 1% is body. It is only reflecting. If you are reflecting, there has to be original. Correct? I don't even recognize that reflection is happening. I am only seeing that it is only there. There is no reflection. Like that I am feeling tender. Mentally is tenderly there. Even the material side is there. That's why they argue there is only matter.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that spiritual life involves a change in perception, and that chanting Hare Krishna and following regulative principles purify the senses, allowing one to see more than before.

Okay. Therefore, you should understand that spiritual life is such that even now you are perceiving everything like this. Just like now I say whatever I see like this. I am seeing. I am not seeing anything more. Suppose I am given new eyes. I see many more things. Right? So don't think your inner eyes now will remain the same. When you chant Hare Krishna, your inner eyes will open. Spiritual intelligence eyes will open. Then you will see much more than what you are seeing now. Now you are seeing a filtered world. Just like a dog can hear so many more frequencies. A dog can hear. I cannot hear so many frequencies. So your senses also become sharper. Your senses become sattvic. Only when your senses become sattvic, that is why unless you follow four regulative principles and all, your inner senses do not open. So your eyes become sattvic. Your ears become sattvic. Then you will see the truth, even relative truth. So it's not that you are the same and now you are seeing something I don't see. The world is not going to change. But forget about the world is not going to change. You are going to change. You are going to develop, specialize. Your senses are going to get purified. Purified. It will be able to see new frequencies, the frequency called bhakti frequency.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how a pure devotee, through devotion, develops the ability to see Krishna everywhere, and addresses the initial confusion about the symptoms of life being considered a field of activity.

A pure devotee has got that bhakti frequency. He can see Krishna everywhere. So when you say, how can a pure devotee see Krishna everywhere? You don't imagine, okay, like I see, he will see. No. He has developed eyes to see. Vemanjana bhakti vilocanena santa sadaiva hrudeshu vilokayanti. Eyes anointed with devotion makes him see Krishna everywhere. Krishna is everywhere but we cannot see. He is within and without everything. But when his eyes are anointed with the frequency of bhakti, he sees Krishna everywhere. Yes, sir. Before the age from the Buddha means after the significance of the Krishna, he says, Vatsa, Veda, Yata, Veda. Then he changed the class. Similarly, we change the body and get into another body. And Prabhupada also, Prabhupada will explain an old person, he will feel the same when he was in the childhood. With that Prabhupada will tell, yeah, there exists no lack of relationship. But there are also the symptoms. But when I read this verse, Prabhupada will take even the symptoms of life also as a field of activity. Confusion came. Then how we can take that example as a food for the soul? How we can take the changing body?

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of watching a movie to explain that the soul (Kshetrajna) remains constant while the body (Kshetra) and experiences change, and that the soul is the one reading the story from the patches of light on the screen.

No, correct. That example, changing bodies, is just to indicate that there is something which is not changing inside you. That example is only for that. Even now, there is something which is not changing inside. Kshetrajna is not changing, Kshetra is changing. Kshetrajna's experience is changing, Kshetra is not changing. The movie you watch is changing, but the movie seer is the same. I can sit in the same seat, morning to evening, watch five movies. I am not changing. My experience is changing. So conviction, life symptoms, all these things are the content of the movie. The content of the movie. Who is the seer of the movie? Me. The content of the movie is not experiencing. What is on the screen is only light patches. There is no hero, there is no heroine, nothing on the screen. Hero and heroine is here. I am mapping. I am reading the story out of the patches of light. What really exists is patches of light. So life, what is called life symptoms in this material world, they are only patches of light. The Kshetrajna is reading the story out of it.

Everything facilitates for you to read a nice movie out of it, starting with I am the body. If you little understand, good enough, be happy. Ultimately it takes time. It takes time. Our consciousness has to purify. The seer itself will transform. Then the seeing will also, higher levels of seeing will happen. If you give me dog's ears, I can hear more frequencies. It is all everywhere. But I did not hear. Now I can. Similarly, spiritual, spirit is everywhere. Krishna is everywhere. It requires spiritual eyes. That is why Prabhupada said, people are, can you show me God? Prabhupada used to ask, do you have the eyes to see God? No, I will learn. Okay. You are real determined to see God, I will tell you how to prepare your eyes. Chant Hare Krishna. Follow four regulative principles. Read Bhagavad Gita. Surrender to Krishna. You will get the eyes to see Krishna. 40京 100京

Another point, important point that Prabhupada is mentioning here is that it is a natural instinct for the Lord to hear and enjoy His personal glories. And because of this, each of us are an individual part and parcel of Krishna. We also have a tendency to feel what? Happy when somebody glorifies us.

But this is asat in the material world, that is pervertedly reflected. In the spiritual world, the devotee also likes to be known in the eyes of the Lord, that He is happy with my service. And therefore when the Guru says, yes, you have done service, good service, then he also likes to hear that. Very good, you have distributed hundred Bhagavatam sets. Very good, Prabhupada says. You should enjoy that. Don't feel shy, it's your nature. Don't enjoy wrong praise. Don't seek wrong praise. Don't take credit for what you do not deserve. You deserve credit for choosing to serve Krishna than Maya. For your choice, that is rewarded, you should feel proud about it and you should expand that pride.

Pride, that I will never serve Maya, I will only serve Krishna. So Krishna's, we are amsa of Krishna. So it's the same tendency is there in us. We are amsa of Krishna, Krishna is sacchidananda, we are amsa, but our present. There is nothing wrong in chasing after happiness, ananda, but we are wrongly chasing. Because without Purna, without Krishna connection, there is no question of getting any strength. If I cut my fingers from the body, it will lose all its strength.

**Summary:** Using the analogy of a severed finger, the speaker explains that the soul, cut off from Krishna, still seeks fulfillment, and that misdirected love of Godhead manifests as lust in the material world.

Our current situation is like that. Even the cut fingers, still hungry for oxygen, blood, everything, doesn't stop. Of course, it's a very crude example. If it is one jiva, one finger is one jiva, cut off from the main, the Lord, that main connection with the Lord is function of devotional service. Gets cut off, then that soul will still, because nature is that, where is ananda, where is jiva? I don't want to die. So all the tendencies, we being part and parcel of Krishna, Krishna's nature is there in us, but it has to be properly redirected. Prabhupada says misdirected love of Godhead is called lust. Just see, lust is defined as misdirected love of Godhead. Your nature is to love God.

**Key Quote:** "Paramatma brings you to Guru and Guru takes you to Krishna."
**Summary:** Krishna, as Paramatma, monitors souls and guides those ready to give up material life to a Guru, who then trains them to realize Krishna.

You see, who comes into contact, who doesn't come into contact, that is arranged by Krishna, who is seated in the heart of the devotee. Every soul is germinating in this material world. Krishna is in your heart. Is this devotee still not fed up with this world? Does he want to come to me or not? Is he questioning what is life? All that Krishna is monitoring in the heart, Paramatma. So therefore, Paramatma, not destiny, Paramatma who knows your spiritual past, who knows your spiritual inclination, who knows how much you are fed up with this world, who knows whether this person is seeking for the truth beyond this illusion, whether this Atma is seeking for purpose of life, all that somebody is monitoring. Who is that? Paramatma. Paramatma takes you to Prabhupada. What is the use of Paramatma bringing you to Prabhupada? Somebody who is not ready to give up his material life and who is completely absorbed in illusion. When Prabhupada went to America, even though they were all very materialistic, these foreigners, they all had searched for truth. What is life? They all had this question. So right there, immediately Prabhupada planted the answers. Yes. So it is not that Prabhupada went to America and he touched everybody and only few became devotees. No. He didn't touch many. Millions of Americans are there. They don't even know who Prabhupada is. Right? So Krishna arranged some souls who are ready. It is said that Krishna brings one to Guru and Guru takes you to Krishna. Paramatma brings you to Guru and Guru takes you and trains you and makes you realize the Supreme Lord Krishna. That Krishna's one aspect is Paramatma. Vande krishnam jagat gurum vise. Who is that? It is the Supersoul. So Supersoul brings you to Guru, Guru brings you to Krishna. Why? Because you have to learn how to become a devotee. Somebody who is a devotee is the best person to teach you how to become a devotee, not God. God is not a devotee. God is receiver of devotee service. So God leaves that duty to the devotee.

You said that the perception of credits, one must have the right credits and take only what belongs to him. Perception of? The credit, how we see credit and how we take credit. So you said our transcendental credit is to Guru and Krishna. So how does a devotee see credits? Because we see that in our organization there are big devotees who have achieved a lot, like Akshaya Patra for example. So how do devotees handle credits without seeking Puja, Laba, or without accepting it as Pratishtha, or so it doesn't become an Anartha. So how should a devotee handle the credits that he gets?

Even if I don't know whether they are pleased or not, I am constantly seeking that. And I have faith because they have told that if you do this, I am pleased.

So I am trying to do it properly. Let's say I chant Hare Krishna. Lord is pleased. But whether I am chanting offenselessly, that's another question. But the fact is that I am trying to chant offenselessly, yes, the Lord is pleased because Lord is pleased by trying to follow His instruction. So to please the Lord, to please the pure devotees of the Lord, to please the Vaiṣṇavas who are representing or representing the desires and wishes of a pure devotee. Yes.

This is what he is seeing in reciprocation, I want to see this, not other rewards. So as far as all the other rewards are concerned, worldly rewards are concerned, or what the karmas come and give us, those things one should just, how can even, you know, all these things, you should just ignore them. You cannot even offer it to somebody, because if you want to offer something to somebody, that person should also like that, right? So it's the spirit of the devotee to offer everything to Guru, but whether the things that are offered by the people, by the karmis, whether they are offerable or not, it's a difference.

But the spirit is, the devotee is saying that if at all in my service the Lord has given me some credit, it is due to the mercy of the Guru and Krishna, to be invested back in the service of the Lord.

It is nothing transcendental about that, the material awards and that you get here in this material world. Now as far as between, within the community of devotees, the devotee's duty is to appreciate the other devotee's service to the Lord, service to Krishna. But when he is appreciating that service, he is not appreciating the Lord. He is not appreciating the service to Krishna, he is not appreciating his ability. Please understand, devotees have crossed all that platform. Because Krishna, he knows, I am the ability in man, Krishna has said. The Lord is doing it. But you give credit, you glorify a devotee for having been an instrument in the hands of the Lord for whatever that you are doing, whether that instrument has come because you are pure or not pure, it is a different matter. But you are an instrument. A neophyte can also do a big service. The Lord may encourage him to do a very big service, but doesn't mean that it is pure devotional service.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how the Lord can use even a neophyte for big service for various reasons, including the burning away of anarthas.

So just see how these are also various things, material measurements of how big service, small service is all, you cannot, can be very misleading. Because ultimately Lord has got unlimited reasons why a neophyte is made to do big service sometimes. To keep him in devotion service, to feed his anartha so that it burns away in a regulated way, in devotion service to burn it, he may do it, it is left to the Lord. And consistently if somebody has to serve the Lord, and that is a different thing, that is Shakti Avesh Avatara, like Prabhupada. The Lord Shakti is in him. Where he does big, big, big, big things. Not big because it is big. It is big because there is a big mission of the Lord here in this world. The Lord is waiting to empower the servants of the Lord with his power to do big things.

So there is a Krishna conscious perspective to doing big things in this world and by the, among the devotees, but there is also a Maya consciousness of doing big things among the devotees. So everywhere the consciousness is important. We need to understand with the right spirit. Not doing all, doing all big, big things for Krishna is Krishna consciousness. No. It can be Krishna conscious or it can be in your head, it could be completely Maya also. I always give this example, a new devotee joins, he says, yes, you should think of doing big, big things for the Lord. You cannot stop me. I want to build a skyscraper in the middle of the Indian Ocean. I want to build a skyscraper in the middle of the Indian Ocean. I want to build a skyscraper in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The temple president says, you are mad. Prabhu, what is the principle? When I am thinking for Lord Krishna, you are telling I am mad. What kind of representative of Krishna are you?

That is what the difference is. And that is Krishna Shakti. Only with Krishna Shakti, you can do seva for Krishna. Does not allow big services like that. Only by Krishna Shakti, you can do it. So he is Shakti of a Shavatara. Shakti of Lord Krishna has come into him. Then he is able to do that. That means he is able to become an instrument. Become an instrument for Lord Shakti to come inside and do all these things. So we need to. So when you read, initially we may get excited because we also say, Okay, okay, nothing Prabhupada had, he did all that. It is a devotional service also because you are appreciating Prabhupada. But should not think that is what it is. Therefore, I can also do something like this. So these are all material ambitions comes. These are not the inner consciousness of a pure devotee. I want to be like Prabhupada. Means you have to understand his heart and be like Prabhupada in his heart.

That also changes that person's because of this flow of Satya energy, he starts seeing all people also being in forgetfulness but they are actually not the body, they are their eternal self. Such a self in this material world, all enacting as different body persons, in maya, he sees that. He starts seeing not only his self as different from the body, he sees other selves as different from their bodies but trapped in the bodily concept of life, engaged in this maya drama.

personas are like filters personas are role plays role play of whom the spirit person but you get conditioned that conditioned persona is is settled in our chittam that is why you say father mother this thing it's all settled in the chittam husband wife before they never knew each other after marriage slowly they become husband wife so they create that persona that persona is not permanent but yet that persona is in their chittam because each time you see the person you don't have to start afresh you have built up relationship so the personas bad habit personas they are all sitting and troubling us a lot you can create good habit personas samskaras that settles and it makes your life spirit person's life easy with all good habits so therefore the understanding of persona as something that we can create and destroy we can weaken or strengthen that is the whole thing about atma jnana 9.1 to 9.30 so the knowledge that persona is different person is different is very useful so that we don't get attached to our old personas and create favorable personas

Bro, it's been like 24 years that Lordships made divine appearance in the HK Hill, and every moment we relish in HK Hill, it's just because devotees like you have worked hard. I'm very thankful to you because of the sacrifices and hardships that you have taken to construct this temple, because of which we are relishing here. I have basically two questions for you, bro. The first question is, there must have been many hurdles and difficulties while you were trying to construct this temple. What always kept you motivated? This is my first question. And second question, in the past two to three decades, whatever has happened in your leadership is a miracle. Coming up with the mega temples like this, soulful japa modules.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees live by faith, trusting in the Lord's protection and guidance, and that obstacles are overcome through devotional service and divine intelligence.

Devotees, they live their life on a day-to-day basis. They have faith that following Prabhupada's instructions of chanting Hare Krishna Maha Mantra 16 rounds and following the morning sadhana, one gets guided, protected by the Lord the whole day. In spite of all the weaknesses. In spite of all the fall downs. Overarching protection of the Lord is there. And His will will be manifest through devotees who follow the instructions of the spiritualist. So in the process, a lot of obstacles from the material point of view. There will be all kinds of obstacles just like any other institution building. All those obstacles will be there. But here, we don't deal with those obstacles on our own. Neither we carry that burden on our head too much. We leave it to the Lord and execute our devotional service. And He gives the intelligence to deal with such problems. See that includes the loving kindness, the love for the Lord, the prayers, the prayers of sacred leaders and the prayers of the devotees. All that He gives to the devotees. And the paradigms of the devotees. This is also predicated on us. All our good deeds shall be inculcated in the sense of our actions. And we have to work and work and work. That shall be the right way. The path of the devotees is not a path of truth. The path of the devotees is a path of faith. And the path of the devotees is a path of ance.

buddhi yoga. Our buddhi gets connected with Krishna's buddhi. All the obstacles are there. It will be there. You will cross over by His mercy. And those obstacles become an opportunity for a devotee to see Krishna's hands everywhere. Just like I mentioned in several other classes, how we started maybe a two bedroom house with anxiety and how we would get every month money to run a temple. 15-20,000 rent and all these things. How in 40 years, 35 years, 35 years, not a single instance where we had to face shortage of, particularly you can say, saksha. No. And never we have had any arrangement of some security. Even today we don't have any such a big temple as to run. People can't believe how it is possible. How next month's electricity bill will come, how next month's clean how you will maintain, how salaries will come. So the Lord is maintaining. With your own eyes you can see. See if you want, you need to have eyes to see this. This is not Shraddha. This is not simply Shraddha. It is a fact. Devotees experience that. It is a fact that the Lord provides.

The Jivas are putting their mind fully glorifying Him, praising Him. Whole world belongs to Him. How many people are recognizing Him? Whole world is supported and maintained by Him. How many people are? No. Very few. Just see how rare it is. The activity that is going on at Hare Krishna Hill in the night in Brahmotsava is going on. All kinds of things are happening.

How do you see your success in fulfilling the Guru's mission? It is not question of my success or your success. It is Prabhupada's success. It is Prabhupada's success.

Otherwise we cannot see long. We cannot see tomorrow even. Jeeva cannot see one day ahead. A visionary means truly he should be able to see long. In the material world actually even people who achieve something, they say he is a visionary. By chance he got what visionary is. Because of his karma the super soul knew the vision. He will reach there. So after reaching there he will say, I am a visionary. Otherwise it is... Krishna is a visionary. Prabhupada is a visionary. Prabhupada had his plan. When I joined in 80s and all there is no brand in India. Nobody knows. If at all they know something, something to do with hippies in America. I know that standing, that prestige. Now you go to the government offices. You say he is gone. They will stand up. In those days, who is this fellow? Now Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir by all this he has a master plan. How to consolidate this Krishna consciousness movement for future generations. During his time he laid the big foundation which is his books. All other foundations may go away. When there is a flood all the foundation will go away. Temples will fall down also. But this foundation of his books will stay.

So the super foundation he has built. Now it all depends on all his disciples. From different angles. From different directions to build up the foundation. The foundation of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's movement. It is a great gift for the world. It is a saving grace for the world. And such a simple process. Just chant Hare Krishna. To tell everybody just chant Hare Krishna we have to build a big VCM and this and that. Only one message. Chant Hare Krishna and be happy. But telling that we have to do all this. And so much so that sometimes we forget the essence is chanting Hare Krishna. We get lost into so many things. I am not happy Prabhu. Prabhupada told chant Hare Krishna and be happy. It is left to you to be happy. Chant Hare Krishna and be happy. That's all. Rest is all. Unhappiness is created by the mind. So this is just like you see Bhagavatam says. Lord lotus feet of Vishnu is worshipped. All things happen. Similarly the lotus feet Nama Prabhu. If the Nama Prabhu is worshipped by the population. By small percent of the population. All auspiciousness will flow into this. Automatically. Nama Nama Kari Baudha Nija Sarva Shakti. Already out. All the Shakti is there. Anybody accidentally chants Hare Krishna also Shakti is there. It flows. Spiritual Shakti is there. Sat Chitta Nananda

**Summary:** The speaker explains that unlike material beings, Krishna's name, form, and personal aspects are non-different from Him, highlighting Krishna's unlimited nature.

Unlike our name and ourselves, in the case of Krishna, the Absolute, there is no difference between Krishna and His name. Just like you say, if you see Krishna's form, you will say, Oh, this is Krishna. You won't separate. The form is something, Krishna is something. Just as Krishna's form is Krishna, the same way Krishna's name is Krishna. This you have to understand. Not only Krishna's name is Krishna, everything connected to Krishna, Krishna's personal aspect of Krishna, is Krishna Himself. So, the Supreme Lord has Nama, Rupa, Leela, Guna, all these things, just like we have. We have Rupa. We have Sharira. Sharira is Rupa. We have a name. We have a mind. We have intelligence. The same way, Krishna is a person. So, Krishna also has, we have one name. Krishna has unlimited names. We have one body. Krishna has unlimited bodies. We have one form. Krishna has unlimited forms. We have limited mind. Krishna has got unlimited mind. We have limited intelligence. Krishna has got unlimited intelligence. This is the difference. Krishna is also a person. We are also persons. God is a person.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the difference between Krishna and humans, explaining that Krishna's body (Sharira) is His soul (Atma), unlike humans where they are distinct.

We are also persons. Now, this difference, Nama, Nami, Abhinatva, Krishna and Krishna's name is not different. That is another difference between us and Krishna. We have a Sharira. Our Sharira is not our Atma. But in Krishna's case, his Sharira is his Atma. Atma is his Sharira. His name is him. He is his name and name is him. He is his form and form is him. This Tattva is called Advaya Jnana. Advaya, anything directly connected to Krishna, there is no duality. Now my body is connected to me, but there is duality. I am not the body. Janma Karma Chame Divyam Yo Ovidyati Tattvata Hatha Ekta Degham Punar Janma Neiti Maa Meiti Soarjuna. This is the secret. If one knows God is a person, I am a person, what kind of a different person he is than me. This is Krishna Tattva.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the sound of the holy name (Shabda) is Krishna Himself, addressing potential doubts about how a sound produced by the tongue can be Krishna.

So when we do our Japa, most important thing that we have to know in the background is that this Shabda is Krishna himself who has appeared before me. Now the question may arise. No, but this Shabda I am creating with my tongue. Does it mean that I create Krishna? If I chant, then Krishna is there. If I don't chant, Krishna is there. Not there. And also I am just vibrating. It is a material vibration. So Krishna is the owner of all these energies. So how is it that this sound is Krishna?

**Key Quote:** "Krishna's Shuddha Nama is Krishna himself."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Nama Avatara, where Krishna enters the sound of His name, clarifying that Krishna doesn't incarnate into the sound but manifests within it.

For that we have to understand that Krishna's Shuddha Nama is Krishna himself. In the spiritual world, Krishna is there. Krishna is Rupa. He is Nama. Everything is. Just mind. Everything is there. He is a full-fledged personality with unlimited, as I told you, unlimited names, unlimited forms, etc. That is the Supreme Lord. He is the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world. So when we say Nama Avatara, this Nama that we utter, Krishna enters this sound. Krishna's Nama of the spiritual world enters this sound that we utter. And as far as Krishna is concerned, just like we are spirit souls, we enter this body. When we enter this body, our body is separate, I am separate. In the case of Krishna, he never incarnates into anybody, whether it is a sound produced by you, or whether it is a marble deity, or a metal deity. Krishna being the source of everything, being the source of that external vigraha, being the source of that, all the external energy, being the source of that, we should consider that sound to be as good as Krishna. He is Krishna himself. If he decides, I am this vigraha, then it is Krishna himself. He decides, it's my energy, it remains his energy.

**Key Quote:** "He is Krishna himself."
**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between an uninstalled and installed deity, explaining that in the latter, Krishna manifests His energetic nature, emphasizing that Krishna reciprocates based on surrender.

Energetic and energy. What is the difference between uninstalled deity and installed deity, or worshipable deity and showcase external vigraha? In one, is only Krishna's energy. In another, the energetic also has entered that vigraha. Energy and energetic is never separated. But Krishna manifests his energetic nature in the vigraha. Krishna is everywhere. Krishna is there in everything. This is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Achintya Veda Veda Tatva. There is no thing, there is no place, there is no situation where God is not present. But being present is one thing, His reciprocation is another thing. He reciprocates according to the principle of as you surrender, I reciprocate. The scriptures have revealed that nam nam akari bahudha nija sarva shakti that all the shaktis, Krishna's personal shakti comes into the nama. This is nama avatara. So, the moment the Lord decides to enter the sound, shakti avesha, enter the sound that you utter, that sound, you should have faith that Krishna is Himself dancing on my tongue. He is Almighty Lord. Being in the spiritual world, still He comes down on my tongue.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that chanting is done to worship the Nama Avatara, take association, and become liberated from the miseries and modes of material nature, emphasizing Krishna's presence.

And why, especially on the order of the Guru, why do we chant? We chant to worship this nama avatara and take association from this nama avatara and become liberated from this miseries of this material world. Become liberated from the three modes of material nature. So, that is the truth about this sound Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Hare Hare So, don't worry that oh, I am producing this sound, how it can be Krishna? Krishna, He becomes that. To touch you, to give you association, He becomes that. So, therefore, in nama japa, the most fundamental, minimum bhavana is sriddha bhavana. Only if we have this bhavana, then we will not convert our japa into a mechanical japa. So, otherwise, we think that japa is just some process, finish sixteen rounds. But in reality, Krishna is coming down to relate with us, to give us association, to give us realization that He is present before us. Give us realization that He is this Samudra, He is the Surya

of Satchidananda. Our soul is always craving for Satchidananda. And He is the Surya of Satchidananda. So, Srila Prabhupada has given us this secret. Now, how to worship the Nama Avatara? Nama Avatara is a fact. Just like one sun reflects on different water bodies. Similarly, Nama Prabhu in the form of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Hare Hare reflects His presence onto each of our tongues. So, the most expansive Avatara of the Lord is this Kali Yuga. In this Kali Yuga, He is Nama Prabhu in the form of Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. If Krishna comes before you, what all would you do in a right manner? If God comes before you, what all you should do, what all you will do in the right manner? I say right manner because no real person can be dealt with according to your own whims. So this is the supreme personality of Godhead. What should be my consciousness when God comes before me?

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna incarnates to receive worship and enter our consciousness, emphasizing the purpose of Nama Avatara is to extract our soul from the complicated mess of material existence and bodily identification.

The supreme personality of Godhead. I should know the situation, the situation in my background, that Krishna has incarnated to receive my worship and to enter my ear holes. And to touch my mind and touch my heart by hearing the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. So for the worship to be complete, for the Nama Avatara to be pleased. Suppose I come to your house for something. If you fulfill that, then I will be very happy. Similarly Nama Avatara is coming on your tongue for a purpose. Because every living entity is his child. Every living entity in the material world is suffering. This is not our real life. So his coming down, his purpose of coming down as a Nama Avatara, just like a magnet. There are so many iron filings, big magnet comes and all the iron filings get attracted to it and you pick out and place the iron filings somewhere else. Similarly Nama Avatara, the purpose of coming off our tongue is to extract our soul from this complicated mess. To extract our soul from out of this body, out of this bodily concept. Extract our soul from false ego.

Okay. The Supreme Lord loves every soul and he wants every one of us desperately. But he wants a false ego free soul. He wants the soul, not the false ego. The false ego is ignorance. Ignorance can be contracted by knowledge. And Krishna Shakthiya Vaishanama Avatara is a reservoir of Shuddha, Nama, Shuddha, Shuddha, Jnana, Vijjana. Nama Prabhu is Jnana Vijjana Surupa, Satchidananda Surupa. So therefore by hearing the Hare Krishna Maham. The Nama Prabhu is very pleased. Oh! Now He is associating with me. He is taking advantage of my going all the way onto his tongue. He is not chanting in vain. Chanting in vain. Convain means taking very little benefit of chanting. Chanting and hearing is very pleasing to the Lord because it serves the purpose.

So go on doing good japa, no more life. Even this life is completely guided, protected, provided for, engaged in His service simply by this worship of the holy name of the Lord. So anyone who understands this essence, their Prabhupada has given us an order to chant 16 rounds, 16 into 108 times. Worship this Nama Avatara. Background, know the purpose, worship. Background, have the desire, it's for pleasing each Nama Prabhu. Then what can be better than daily associating with Krishna Himself? We don't feel that association of Krishna because of the offences in japa. And knowing the philosophy of Krishna consciousness, most of the 10 offences described in Padma Purana, are avoided by the devotees. Because they don't consider the demigods or anybody equal to the Supreme Lord. All these things, to learn the philosophy of Krishna consciousness, that this worshipping the holy name is not some ritualistic punya activity. It's a ritual. All this we know, so we avoid all these offences.

**Summary:** The speaker identifies the two main offenses in chanting as blaspheming devotees and inattentive chanting, explaining that sins arise from ignorance and the holy name is merciful and powerful enough to wipe out sinful tendencies.

Only two offences we are vulnerable to. One is to blaspheme the devotees. Another is inattentive chanting. And inattentive chanting comes because, inattentive chanting, if one does not follow the regulatory principles, it's very difficult to attentively chant. If you have to worship the holy name of the Lord, better and better, we should be free from all sins. No doubt. The holy name is so powerful. All sins are happening because of ignorance. Because we do not know what is our true welfare. For some immediate pleasure, we think that is my real welfare. And we perform sins, sinful activities. And that, since ignorance is a root cause of that, even if you're chanting without being free from sins, very soon if you hear and chant, then sin, sinful habits, plus soul's sinful tendency will all get wiped out.

**Key Quote:** "This treasure is God Himself."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the holy name is the greatest treasure, which is God Himself, and the quality of japa depends on the quality of the background feeling, explaining the difference between conscious and background mind.

The greatest treasure should be kept very carefully, served very carefully, related with very carefully. It is not an impersonal treasure, somebody gives you treasure, whole box of jewellery, this that. This treasure is God Himself. So therefore how much? So Prabhupada says you chant sixteen rounds and serve this Nama Mathara everyday. Prabhupada says the quality of japa depends upon the quality of the background feeling. The quality of the background is the differences of foreground mind and background mind and subconscious mind. Now I am speaking to you, you are hearing. That is your conscious mind is hearing. In the background mind you are passively relating what you are hearing with what all you know. That means your background is hearing everything in a context. Context that you are hearing the speaker, the context that what is the subject matter of hearing. These are all contexts. Background mind is a context mind. Background mind is a relating mind.

**Key Quote:** "Background mind should always be in the context of japa."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the background mind should be focused on the context of japa, such as shraddha, the purpose of japa, or feelings of priti, to avoid mechanical chanting.

It is through the background mind with which you relate with what you do in the foreground mind. If your background mind is solving some problem and thinking of this problem, feeling some problem, and you are chanting in the foreground mind, then the chanting will become mechanical. So background mind should always be in the context of japa. Whether it is Shraddha, whether it is remembering the purpose of japa, whether you are remembering the golden command, or whether you want to offer feelings of priti for each bead in reciprocation to realizing how much priti he has in coming to me, descending on my tongue, or it can be Aghlada, feeling great elation that God is before me. Feeling so grateful that Lord has come before me from the depth of the heart, cry out to him with gratitude. You have learnt so many things from Prabhupada's books. What is surrender? God has come before you. Practice that now. Surrender to him. With your bhavana, sharnagati bhavana. Shraddha bhavana. Aghlada javana. Hrithpurvaka bhavana.

**Summary:** The speaker encourages building up enthusiasm and feeling pleasure with each chanting, emphasizing the importance of humility and chanting with an egoism freed from false egoism.

Utsaha bhavana. Enthusiastically build up. Each chanting of the Hare Krishna, you should think you have earned the pleasure of Krishna. Utsaha means how to earn more and more, how to become more and more wealthy, how to become spiritually richer and richer, one more pleasure giving to Nama Prabhu, one more pleasure giving to Nama Prabhu. This bhavana in the background, with this bhavana in the background, you do the tasking. Tasking means building up the number of sevas. You should know that not only you are counting the number of japa, Krishna is also counting your number of japa. As you finish one mala, he is waiting for the next mala. Okay, one he has finished, take one more. Because Krishna wants nirantara smaranam. Krishna wants smaranam. The next better, more pleasing to me is nirantara smaranam. Satatam ananyas chintayantoma. Krishna becomes conquered. Which is very tough, but we can practice. To finish sixteen rounds without thinking of anything, but chanting and hearing and feeling that this is Krishna, feeling ahalada, krithurvaka japa, feeling utsaha, feeling sharanagati, feeling krithajna, recognizing He is my protector, bharta patra, nakshapatra, feeling self humility, egoism, insignificant servant egoism. Chanting with the egoism, which is freed from false egoism.

**Key Quote:** "Every card is a relationship with the holy name."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the use of cue cards to meditate on the glory of the Lord and develop feelings associated with japa, explaining how repeated contemplation can transform thoughts into feelings.

So all these are, these cue cards that have been made are meant for two things. One is for us to read that, other than japa time. Meditate on the glory of the Lord. Every card is a relationship with the holy name. And, these cards are first a thought. Let's say somebody doesn't know who is Krishna. So if you tell him Krishna is supreme personality of God, it's only a thought. He hears many many many times. Just like we have heard so many times. This fact that Krishna is supreme personality of Godhead. So it has become a feeling. When we say Krishna is supreme personality of Godhead, it becomes a feeling. Bhavana. In the same way, all these bhavanas associated with japa. Number one, first these cards are meant for repeated reading. You repeatedly read them for six months, one year. Then afterwards you don't have to read. They would have become feelings related with the holy name. For instance, Krishna is Krishna's name himself. It is Krishna himself. So it becomes a feeling. Now Krishna is here. So the card, after that state, card acts as a trigger to the bhavana that is gone into your subconscious by repeated contemplation

**Summary:** The speaker draws an analogy with anger to explain how feelings are connected to thoughts, emphasizing that good japa involves feeling the relationship with Nama Prabhu and synchronizing the foreground and background minds for concentration.

on the thoughts associated with these feelings. Just like an angry person, behind the anger there is a thought that causes the anger. There is a reason, there is a thought that causes the anger. But when you are angry, you don't remember the thought, you don't think the thought. You feel the thought. So in the same way, good japa is thinking, sorry, chanting, hearing, feeling the Nama Prabhu. Feeling the relationship with Nama Prabhu. Feeling about Nama Prabhu. Feelings offered to Nama Prabhu. Feeling the feelings that Nama Prabhu has towards us. So if these feelings are in the background, you will connect it to Nama. Who is in the foreground? Foreground. This feeling is about whom? Feeling is about the Nama Avatara who is appearing on each bead. It is not that foreground mind is going one direction and background mind is feeling. No. Background and foreground mind works in a synchronized manner. Just like now you are listening to me, your foreground mind, background mind is synchronized. When it is synchronized, that is concentration. Then that is giving full attention. Artificially try to bring attention back, bring attention back, bring attention back. How long you will go? It is very tiring for the mind. So if you do groundwork for it, if you have support of your background mind, chanting becomes beautiful. Chanting will never become mechanical. That is soulful japa.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces a method for practicing soulful japa, involving locking attention through anusarana, sankalpa, and experiencing divya cheshta shakti from the nama, leading to ruchi and ease in chanting.

So we have devised this method of practicing this. For one year, two years you practice, rest of the life you take your first mala, first you lock your attention through anusarana, golden command, feel that I should seva by seva, distinct seva, feel saviour on each bead. All these things, the first mala you, and then you set the, you lock the attention through sankalpa, that I will hear, and vikalpa that I will not, I will not think. So the first mala locks the attention on chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing. How it gets locked? The shakti to lock. What is the, what, the mind gets dragged away by so many things. So you have to control the mind to lock. But we only struggle first round, deliberately, with faith that the shakti to control the mind is in the nama. Divya cheshta, what you are doing is a divya cheshta, is a divine effort. So divine effort, you get divya cheshta shakti from nama. And this can be really experienced. How beautifully the attention gets locked to chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing. No, nothing else comes in the mind. If divya cheshta shakti is flowing into our heart, and it flows into our heart, we will feel no struggle, in doing the japa, we will feel that ruchi, that sense of ease with which we chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare,

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of moving a finger through air versus paint to illustrate the smoothness achieved with divya cheshta shakti, explaining the importance of anusvarna, arthavat, vidivat, and uninterrupted chanting.

Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. If you move your finger in some paint, or in honey, like this, you will find lot of resistance, no? You move your finger in the air, no resistance. When you get divya cheshta shakti, your chanting and hearing will be like this, in the air. Smoothly, mind will not disturb. Otherwise mind will drag. So mala one, anusvarna arthavat vidivat. Anusvarna means obedience to golden command. Arthavat means purposeful. Whenever any activity we do with a, we load the purpose in the background, then there will be focus. Your purpose should not be routine finishing of sixteen rounds. To understand the purpose is worshipping nama on each bead. So arthavat means purposeful. Vidivat, Guru has told exactly what is the vidhi. Chant distinctly, hear clearly, the very same chant is a vidhi. And, to uninterruptedly chant. Uninterrupted means uninterrupted by any other doing. Japa time means japa doing, not any other doing. You can kirtaniya sadahari, you can chant, you are cooking, you chant while driving, all that you can do, extra. But you have to chant sixteen rounds, without doing anything else. Without solving, trying to engage your mind in solving this problem, that problem, thinking about what I should do today, this, that, all these things. That is something else. This exclusively doing for Krishna. So that is a vidhi.

All these things you practice, it goes into your subconscious mind. And afterwards, it naturally, it becomes your second nature to lock the attention. Just like now it has become a habit for us to chant and do some thinking. In the same way, it becomes a habit that you cannot think of anything else. Chanting and hearing, chanting and hearing becomes a habit. The mind can be trained. So Shraddha is a second mala. As I told, it's a basic Shraddha that Krishna is present before me. Another point of Shraddha is, Krishna is pleased by my chanting. To get that realization, He is pleased, you have to understand the philosophy, you have to understand the background, that bhavana to come, you have to understand the reasons behind it. Then Preeti japa, Hrithpurvaka japa, Agalatha japa, I have repeated this in every, I'm not repeating it now.

So let us go on to the second set of sixteen rounds. And remember that chant, hear, feel, chant, hear, feel. Don't indulge in thought processing. So Prabhupada is continuously prompting the golden command. Every eighteen beats, He comes and He reminds you, chant and hear that very sound. So when you are practicing here, don't think, oh this is the same message I'm hearing again and again. Oh I know what it is. It is not for knowing. He is speaking so that you follow next eighteen beats. Next eighteen beats you follow that. Then again He comes and says, He reminds us, next eighteen beats you follow, anusarana bhavana. So this is training. For the sake of training only, Prabhupada is, every eighteen beats is coming. Not for your knowledge. You already know what is golden command. But you need to be reminded. I should chant and hear that very sound. So that is the most important. Go following the golden command is ninety percent soulful japa. Okay.

**Summary:** This segment introduces the importance of a bona fide spiritual master in guiding individuals towards Krishna Consciousness by imparting instructions through oral reception.

OM NAMO BHAGWATE VASUDEVAYA. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 22, Text 7. I have fortunately been instructed by you and thus great favor has been bestowed upon me. I thank God that I have listened with open ears to your pure words. Srila Rupa Goswami has given directions in his Bhakti Rasamita Sindhu on how to accept a bona fide spiritual master and how to deal with him. First, the desiring candidate must find a bona fide spiritual master and then he must very eagerly receive instructions from him and execute them. This is reciprocal service. A bona fide spiritual master or saintly person always desires to elevate a common man who comes to him because everyone is under the delusion. Because everyone is under the delusion of Maya and is forgetful of his prime duty, Krishna Consciousness, a saintly person always desires that everyone become a saintly person.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes receiving transcendental messages through oral reception from a spiritual master, who guides individuals to perform duties in Krishna Consciousness according to their abilities, referencing Arjuna's service as a military man.

It is the function of a saintly person to invoke Krishna Consciousness in every forgetful common man. Manu said that since he was advised and instructed by Kardamma Muni, he was very much favoured. He considered himself lucky to receive the message by oral reception. It is especially mentioned here that one should be very inquisitive to hear with open ears from the authorized source of the bona fide spiritual master. How is one to receive? One should receive the transcendental message by oral reception. The word, Karnarandhraja, means through the holes of the ears. The favour of the spiritual master is not received through any other part of the body but the ears. This does not mean, however, that the spiritual master gives a particular type of mantra through the ears in exchange for some dollars and if the man meditates on that, he achieves perfection and becomes God within six months. Such reception through the ears is bogus. The real fact is that the bona fide spiritual master knows the nature of a particular man and what sort of duties he can perform in Krishna Consciousness and he instructs him in that way. He instructs him through the ear not privately but publicly, you are fit for such and such work in Krishna Consciousness, you can act in this way. One person is advised to act in Krishna Consciousness by working in the deity's room. Another is advised to act in Krishna Consciousness by performing editorial work. Another is advised to do preaching work. And another is advised to carry out Krishna Consciousness in the cooking department. There are different departments of activity in Krishna Consciousness and a spiritual master, knowing the particular ability of a particular man, trains him in such a way that by his tendency to act, he becomes perfect. Bhagavad Gita makes it clear that one can attain the highest perfection of spiritual life simply by offering service according to his ability, just as Arjuna served Krishna by his ability in the military art.

**Summary:** This segment highlights the importance of receiving instructions from the spiritual master and faithfully executing them to achieve spiritual perfection, emphasizing the disciple's duty and the expert guidance of the spiritual master.

Arjuna offered his service fully as a military man and he became perfect. Similarly, an artist can attain perfection simply by performing artistic work under the direction of the spiritual master. If a man is a literary man, he can write articles and poetry for the service of the Lord under the direction of the spiritual master. One has to receive the message of the spiritual master in order to be perfect. spiritual master regarding one's capacity for the spiritual master is expert in giving such instructions. This combination, the instruction of the spiritual master and the faithful execution of the instruction by the disciple makes the entire process perfect. Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur describes in his explanation of the verse in Bhagavad Gita, that one who wants to be certain to achieve spiritual success must take the instruction from the spiritual master as to what his particular function is. He should faithfully try to execute that particular instruction and should consider that his life and soul. The faithful execution of the instruction by the disciple is the best way to achieve spiritual success. The faithful execution of the instruction which he receives from the spiritual master is the only duty of a disciple and that will bring him perfection. One should be very careful to receive the message from the spiritual master through the ears and execute it faithfully. That will make

This is the process of liberation from material energy. What is the process? The process is oral reception. You have to hear from authorized source.

**Summary:** This segment describes Krishna consciousness as direct reception of transcendental words, explaining how material intellect acts as a barrier and how faith and oral reception are crucial for attaining transcendental intelligence.

transcendental consciousness, just by hearing. It is not the path of Krishna consciousness. Krishna consciousness, ultimately, is a path of direct reception of the words that emanate from the transcendental platform. Direct reception, without the interference by our material intellect. The material intellect is like a shutter. It opens that shutter. This material intellect, a shutter always stops light, isn't it? In a camera, a shutter stops light. As far as spiritual bhakti is concerned, when you compare it with the process of receiving transcendental words from the spiritual master, receiving transcendental sound, the material speculative intelligence is like a shutter. It has to be opened up. What does that mean? First, one should have faith that the shabda, that the words that emanate from a pure devotee, has God, the knowledge is God, is contained within that. The intelligence to understand those words are also contained within that. You only have to receive transcendental intelligence. Your material intelligence gets purified by transcendental intelligence. Material intelligence cannot lead us to transcendental intelligence.

Only oral reception can lead us to transcendental intelligence.

you are servant of Krishna, surrender to Krishna, you are servant of Krishna. Suppose the intellect had come in between. Arrey, this I already know, he already told once. I am servant of Krishna, he has told once, I already know. Again he is saying, I am servant of Krishna, I already know. See, intellect means it ends there. Moment you know it ends there.

Krishna is supreme personality of Godhead. But each time you read, read, read, every time you hear, you get transcendental. This is a very big secret for spiritual advancement.

Sometimes we are all very overconfident about our material intelligence, our rational intelligence. It is very limited. It is a very limited chapter. It is a way of growth.

But you know in one second your knowledge can go. It can go into forgetfulness. It is just like Karmis think. I am rich. I got lot of money. In one moment money can go anytime. He can become a pauper. In the same way transcendental knowledge also. You cannot have a sense of possession. You cannot have a sense of possession towards a transcendental knowledge. There should be a sense of reception. All reception. Welcoming and hearing the sound. That comes from a transcendental source. And that sound will expand transcendental knowledge into our heart. Realization into our heart. Transcendental feelings into our heart. And unless transcendental feelings come into our heart. Nothing will get purified. Because all our impurities are in the form of feelings. Wrong feelings. And where are these wrong feelings? These wrong feelings are all stored in our subconscious mind. That is why habits and all don't change. Intellectually you are convinced but your habits don't change. Why? Because they are all stored and packed and tied together with certain feelings in your subconscious. So unless the subconscious gets purified. Subconscious means you are not conscious.

Means the right feelings have to go inside as we discussed yesterday. Submissive hearing. Submissive hearing means even the feeling of the speaker will go inside. The feeling has to go inside because the contamination is inside. Deep inside. Unless it enters. Simply it remains at an intellectual conviction at your conscious level. That is not enough. You will get temporary benefit. 2-3 days you will be fired up. After hearing something. You hear a japa seminar 2-3 years. 2-3 days your chanting will be very nice. Afterwards it is gone. Why? 2-3 days it is in your short term memory it is there. Scientists have found out that in short term memory means it is only a chemical state. Today you hear something in your neurons. The chemical you know chemical adjustment. Long term memory means that chemical adjustment goes and changes your neurons structure. There is a structural change in your brain. Just other day I was reading this article about neuroplasticity of brain. Brain is such a wonderful thing. Neuroplasticity. Your change can happen by difference in chemical concentrations in the mind. In the brain. Let us say now you learn one sloka. In your short term memory it remains. Immediately in the brain there are certain chemical levels which is corresponding to this learning sloka. And it remains there. But in 2-3 days it will go away. It will go away. It will go away. But in 2-3 days that chemical will go to normal. You have forgotten this sloka.

Nityam Bhagavata Seveya Bhagavati Uttama Slokye Bhaktir Bhavati Naishitiki. Where is this? You are not consciously saying. It has become a structural change in your mind. Let us say first time when you learn that sloka. First 2-3 days. It has not yet become. You will forget it. Now you will not forget it. Because it will just come. Because it has become a structural change in your mind. So anyway. So that is about simple memory thing. So these things have to go deep inside through feelings. Then there has to be a submissive oral reception. That oral reception is so important. That it is such a big thing. That it is such a big factor. The word used is Karna Randrehe. Means through the holes of the ears. The favour of the spiritual master is not received through any part of the body but the ears. Now next Prabhupada is touching upon another very very very very important point. One is about ok. Hearing the transcendental knowledge. The rest of the purport Prabhupada is talking about hearing instructions for your service. Whole purport is about it.

**Summary:** This segment discusses how Srila Prabhupada, despite having thousands of disciples, may have directly instructed only a few, and how the institutional system he set up is a mystical extension of his direct instruction.

The rest of the purport is about it. In earlier days. The Guru used to take only few disciples. Earlier days means just even before the movement. Before Bhaktivinoda Thakur. Even during Bhaktivinoda Thakur also. How many disciples he had? Bhakti Siddhanta Sarva Thakur. How many disciples? May be. Bhakti Siddhanta Sarva Thakur. More disciples in Gaudiya Mathura. First time Bhakti Siddhanta. Otherwise as per this tradition. Spiritual master has accepted some disciples. See so many things Prabhupada is saying here. Ok. The real fact is that spiritual master knows the nature of a particular man. And what sort of duties he can perform in Krishna consciousness. And he instructs him in that way. Now the big question comes. When Prabhupada started this Krishna consciousness movement. He built an institution. Temple presidents. GBC. Temple presidents. And all these things he set it up. Out of thousands and thousands of disciples. Srila Prabhupada would have directly instructed. What sort of duty. Probably you know a dozen or twenty or thirty or fifty disciples. Or even hundred disciples. He would have instructed. Therefore we have to understand that Srila Prabhupada. Instruction is non different from. Prabhupada giving direct instruction is non different. From. The institutional system he set up for receiving instruction.

**Summary:** This segment explains that Prabhupada operates through his servants within the institutional system, and that having faith in this process is crucial for devotees to make advancement.

How can it be same? Mysticism. Mystical. One should understand that Prabhupada is in our midst. Prabhupada was in the midst of all the devotees during his presence. Even though they were receiving instruction from the temple presidents and temple commanders and all. Prabhupada is to operate through them. If you have the faith. And therefore devotees made advancement. Because everybody is a servant of Srila Prabhupada. Temple president is a servant of Prabhupada. Everybody is a servant of Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada acts through one servant to another servant. Is there a difficulty in that? It goes in line with every principle of Vaishnavism. It goes through that process. So if one has faith. Yes it will work. And. We also need to. You know simultaneously understand that that is little different from. Directly Prabhupada saying. It is one and. Different. But the different aspect you have to be very careful. Because if the temple president says something. Go and do this sinful activity. Very obvious no. So principle is not operating there. Is not operating there. Now why don't you drink tea coffee also. No problem. It will not operate there. But if in sincerity. Somebody is executing. His duty. Not only depends upon. The person who is giving instruction. Now we are discussing the problem from the side of the person who is receiving instruction. How will I get. Similar instruction of what according to my ability. What I should do all these things. What should be. What is it that I should receive from Srila Prabhupada.

**Summary:** This segment shifts focus to the receiver of instruction, emphasizing the importance of faith in Prabhupada operating through the system to receive the right guidance.

That is a problem of the receiver. The problem of the receiver is to find. You know how I. To get convinced that you know. My Guru. Srila Prabhupada. Is working through this mechanism. He has that faith. He has to have that faith also. If he does not have faith. He will not get the right instruction from the authority. It's a two way thing. The giver of instruction should represent himself as Srila Prabhupada's servant. The receiver of instruction should have faith. In fact this is more important. The faith of the person that see I. I pray to Srila Prabhupada that I get the right kind of instruction from my. From the system. Here. Mystically operates. And once you take gets the instruction then you think he understands that this is Prabhupada's instruction to me. This is a duty assigned to me. I should execute it meticulously. Seriously. As a servant of the servant of the servant. I should execute it. So unless one understands this mystical process in which this works. If one simply thinks one does not. Consider the. That Prabhupada is operating through the devotees. Who are chanting their 16 rounds. Who are following the instruction that given by Srila Prabhupada. Who are executing their duties. There are some duty. It is a duty of certain people to give instruction to people who are below. It is a duty. So while doing that duty that will be. That will be. When he is chanting 16 rounds. When he is doing whatever Prabhupada has told. That duty will pass down.

That right instructions will come. Now this is something very. Sometimes very bewildering to the mind. How can it be exactly. See he asked me to do now cooking today. How do I know that you know. Just like Prabhupada says. Here he says. This spiritual master knows your particular nature. And what sort of duties he has to perform. And he instructs him that way. No doubt we are Prabhupada disciples. Everything is fact. It is acting on us. We are enjoying or we are part of this process. We are part of this process. Each one of us are part of this process. If you have got a service in the DT room. If you have got a service in the kitchen. It is all Prabhupada. Through Prabhupada only it is coming. Otherwise you will feel that. Somebody told me. Okay I will wait one day when Prabhupada will tell me. That day will never come. That day will never come. Why not take that your whatever duty you get as highly sacred and execute it. It is sacred. Temple president is an instrument. Temple commander is an instrument. Assistant commander is an instrument. Department head is an instrument. There is a mystical process happening here. Mystically these things are happening. One has to accept that. The service that he is doing is sacred. It is coming from my spiritual master. And then sometimes one may think. Oh okay then they gave me this service. Then they thought that is wrong. Maybe you are not good at it. Now we realize you are not good at it. The authority will say. Now we realize you are not good at it. Now we will give you another service. Then your mind will think. They should have thought of it earlier. I am not good at it. How do you explain that?

**Key Quote:** "The first thing that devotee should learn for several years in his life is not about particular service. It is about servitude."
**Summary:** This segment advises devotees to focus on developing an attitude of servitude and following instructions, rather than over-analyzing the specific service they are assigned.

This is another very important point devotee should understand. In the beginning when we say according to one's capacity all those things. The first thing that devotee should learn for several years in his life. Is not about particular service. It is about servitude. Developing the attitude of servitude. One should not get into this analysis paralysis. That oh okay so today I have been sent to Ashton Pujari for doing this. Okay I do not know really why Prabhupada brought me into. Maybe Prabhupada does not want me to Ashton Pujari. Maybe Prabhupada wants me to cut sabji. This is analysis paralysis. You paralyze your life by analyzing too much. So if you assume that Prabhupada wants every time what exactly you should be doing. That is an illusion. In Prabhupada's mind that is not there. Prabhupada's mind sometimes he may have. But every point every hand he move. Every you know thing you move. Prabhupada wants and that is what you are doing. Prabhupada is saying. Prabhupada is teaching us Krishna consciousness to serve the Supreme Lord. Right. So Prabhupada will say look. You are a neophyte now. This will be in Prabhupada's mind. You are a neophyte. I am not very particular about whether you cut sabji or do Ashton Pujari work. Possible no? So why we should assume that everything. Any service. Now I want you to follow this system. And learn how to be a servant.

This is the stage for you to learn how to become a. Follow instructions. You as my disciple. I am focusing on developing your servitude. Whether you cut sabji. Somebody else gives Ashton Pujari. You know cleaning the pots. Does not matter. Somebody will do it and service will go on. If you don't cut sabji. Somebody else. Somebody will cut sabji. There is nothing particularly I am going to you know. Some spiritual lesson coming from. Cutting sabji which cannot be got from. Washing the pots. So don't get into this analysis paralysis. When a particular. Suppose some particular service. These are all very very high things. Like Lord Krishna wanted Prabhupada to. Or Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur wanted. Or some specific instruction to Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur. Go to America and preach. We should not imitate that. Neither Krishna nor Prabhupada wants any of those particular things now. When we clean ourselves then one day it will manifest. When we learn how to be humble. When we learn how to be servant. At the right stage. That kind of instruction. Divya Gyan. Hidayat Prakash. Within the heart of the disciple. The spiritual master will guide him. And he will be convinced that I have to do this. He will be convinced I have to do it. Now is a purification stage. We have to purify ourselves. Now I got a dream that I should build a temple in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Nobody can stop me now. You will go and drown in the Indian Ocean. There is a process of purification. There is a process that the Guru is expecting out of you. All upstart thinking you should not get into. Then you will mess up your life. Be patient. Be Shanti.

**Summary:** This segment addresses the problem of devotees comparing their services based on social status, emphasizing that each devotee's journey is unique and comparison leads to unhappiness.

That is one thing. Another problem is here. From this another very important thing is. Prabhupada is saying. Another may be advised to carry out cooking department. Preaching work. Doing meditation. Another biggest problem with devotees face. New devotees face is. They think that. You know. My service. One set of people think. My service is very big. Big service. Another set of devotees think. My service is very small. Small service. Small big. All they are talking in terms of social. Socially big. Oh leader service is big service. I am just cooking. My service is. You know. Socially you know. It may be that. It's alright. Now that devotee is thinking. He is so good in cooking. But in his mind he is thinking. When I will become a management leader. That is perfection of life. And then. Because he does not have the guna karma. He will constantly be frustrated. Constantly be frustrated. Because he is always comparing. So therefore. From this you should understand. The formula for unhappiness in spiritual life is when you compare yourself with others. You are what you are. Tomorrow you will be what you are meant to be. From where you are. With the mercy of Prabhupada. You will be somewhere else. That is.

Here is a person who is so detached. When will I get that kind of detached. Here is a devotee who is always working hard. Compare. I am not working hard like this. I want to work hard. Here is a devotee who typed so fast. You know. 70 words per minute. What is the use of getting fascinated with it. One day I also want to type at 70. It has nothing to do with your service. I want to do. Here is a devotee. So beautiful painting he made about Krishna. Amazing. So wonderful. Okay. You appreciate. Enjoy the picture. That is your right. Now you are thinking. You can't draw one sketch. When I can make that painting. When I can do that. When I can do like that. What is the use of all that. Rather the devotee should think. When I can be devoted to my work. The way the devotee was devoted to that painting. That is the way we should compare. If at all. Because we cannot stop comparing. We are a society. We are a social being. It will always be there. We should compare for getting inspired. We should not compare for getting despaired. I don't know whether there is a word like that in English. As I said. It is a formula for permanent unhappiness.

No. Any two individuals are their abilities all same? No. They are all different. You should think I am what I am. I am unique. In that sense. There is no another second Madhu Pandit. Correct? Those who are very depressed. They compare, compare, compare, compare. And at the end they become what? So depressed. I am nothing, they think. One devotee came to me like that. You are full of comparison, comparison, comparison. I am nothing. Because he is always comparing. Then he is nothing. Then I told that devotee, is there another human being just like you in this universe you find out? He said, no. So you are something. You are something unique. You cannot find another person like you in the entire universe. Ah! Some value is there now for me. I thought I had no value at all. It is a fact. It is a fact.

Please be what you are in your service. Aspire for devotional qualities. Don't aspire for social rise here, that, this, this thing, that thing. You know, when I will be temple commander, when I will be this, when I will be this. Because you see what happens. The material world is a lording world. So lording has got good value in this material world, conditionally. Somebody who has got control over money, control over position, all these things, it gives value. So we don't get bewildered by all these things because we are left and come. A devotee who thinks he is a temple president is not a temple president. A devotee who thinks I am a temple commander is not a temple commander. A devotee who thinks that I am a servant temple president, he is in the right platform. I am a servant temple commander. I am a servant assistant temple commander. If you enjoy giving instructions, which are very difficult for somebody to follow. If you enjoy giving instruction. If you enjoy criticizing, those who work under you, sometimes you have to criticize. But you enjoy, there is one formula, whether you should tell yourself, should now I see that I have to correct this devotee.

It is painful for you to criticize. If it is painful for you, do it. If you are enjoying, don't do it. You cannot enjoy criticizing any Vaishnava. But at the same time you have to, sometimes your duty is to criticize and correct. The spirit has to be, the right spirit of service has to be there when you criticize, when you correct.

**Summary:** This segment addresses a question about how devotees outside the institutional system receive guidance, emphasizing the importance of associating with the temple and following the instructions of the authority.

Any questions? Here. Hare Krishna Prabhu. Hare Krishna. Prabhu said like in a system like whatever Prabhu there was one statement like you read in the Parbhad King. Prabhupada engages us, he knows our nature and he engages us what we are good at. So now physically Prabhupada is not there. So when we are under the system, so whatever our authority says through the system we get Prabhupada's instructions. But there are many followers of Prabhupada who are not in the system, who are outside the institution. How do they get guidance of Prabhupada in that? Outside the system also they have to be. That is why see the temple president is the one who recommends somebody for initiation. And the temple president is a spiritual authority for them also. They just go flying around after initiation, they won't advance. They have to associate with the temple. They have to take guidance from the temple. That is very important. Sadhu Sangha factor is not exempted for them. So Sadhu Sangha is happening in ashram, in this thing they are happening continuously in the Vaishnava community it is happening. Just because I am a congregation you know I don't have to listen to temple president. Finish, you are going to Maya, finish. Advancement is gone. I don't have to listen to temple authority, it is gone. Ahankara comes. False ego comes. One thinks he is a big achiever. I achieved this, I achieved this. It will not last for long.

**Summary:** This segment explains that Prabhupada wants both results and a proper attitude, warning that success can feed false ego and lead to a loss of spiritual power if not approached with humility and service.

When you distribute books, when you do anything, what does Prabhupada wants? You should not first think that... Prabhupada wants two things, you should always remember. One is my attitude, another is he wants result. He is happy. It is recorded, you distribute more books, Prabhupada is happy. But if your attitude you are getting more and more of that. More and more ahankara, more and more confident. I am, I am, I am doer, I am doer. And then you are distributing books. Slowly you lose your power. Spiritual power you will lose. You will fall down. Spiritually you will fall down. Your material ability you may be pursuing, but spiritually you will fall down. You will not be able to follow regulated principles. You will become, you are choked. It is just like a weed. The weed is growing. Success is, success is feeding your false ego. Success is not feeding your soul. Simply lip service you do, Prabhupada's, Prabhupada's mercy I distributed so many books. Prabhupada's mercy I distributed so many books. You don't mean what you mean. It is just words you say. But inside you are feeding your, socially you are feeding your ahankara. So those who are not within the temple atmosphere, those who get initiated, they should be connected to the temple. They should understand that, you know, they should follow the instructions of the authority. Then they are safe. Otherwise simply going on, it goes on. They won't find happiness. They won't find that, that spiritual progress. They cannot feel that.

**Summary:** This segment addresses a question about how to criticize someone when one knows they will enjoy it, emphasizing the importance of escalating the issue to a higher authority if one cannot criticize without enjoyment, and adjusting one's approach based on the devotee's consciousness.

Yes. Hare Krishna, Prabhu. Prabhu, you told that if you are enjoying criticism of a Vaishnava, if you are authority of him, if you are enjoying, then don't do it. And if you are, the moment you feel pain in criticizing, then you do it. So, suppose if I am authority and if I am, I have to criticize someone, somebody has done mistake. Sure. I know that I will enjoy that criticism. So should I wait for the day to come? Not wait for the day. First you should, first, because you are obligated to do your duty. You have this knowledge that without enjoying, try to criticize. If you cannot, please take it to your higher authority, who may be capable of without enjoying, criticize. You cannot leave. Duty cannot be neglected. The person has to be corrected means he has to be corrected. Somebody has to do the job. So, then you should think this is Prabhupada's test. This is a test that Prabhupada has given me. I should build up my internal thing that I am, while doing this service of telling another Jeeva something, criticizing, I cannot be enjoying that. It is a service to that devotee. So, I have to build up that service mode. I cannot be impulsive. So, duty also has to be done. You need not wait for it. Escalation is there. Go to the next level, next level, next level. That way it is safe. Anybody who is an authority, when they criticize, when there are difficult situations, sometimes the devotee very rebellious becomes. Then, you know, you need to give a lording back. Everything, every time in management, soft thing doesn't work. Right? The person will be completely in Maya. What is the use of showing spiritual humility before him? He will go more into Maya. So, you have to go according to that devotee's consciousness. You have to become very heavy also. So, with great difficulty you should become heavy, not enjoy becoming heavy. I don't know that. This is a very, very, for a Vaishnava, this is a very unpalatable job. To criticize a devotee, to get heavy on a devotee, it's not an enjoyable thing. But it has to be done. And when you do it with that difficulty, with that restriction, with that hesitation, you will see it will have the spiritual power

It is a sound in which the Lord has entered. It becomes a Lord's sound body. Touching this sound is equal to touching the Lord. The Lord is all pure, all knowledge, all bliss, all love.

So, japa is tasking of chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing towards a particular goal. Number one, mala 108 times, just like today we are doing 108 into 108. In the same day, if you are doing 16 rounds, then your task is complete 16 rounds. In one session, you are going to, you have sat and you have decided, I am going to do four rounds, then you have to task. Your task is four rounds. What is this tasking? During japa, what is this task? During japa, it is a doing task and not a thinking task. Our mind is constantly thinking and keeping us away from ourselves. It is keeping us away from God. So, we have to stop this thinking, tasking of thinking, thinking for any purpose. Forget it, during japa. Japa is for tasking of a doing. What is that? Move your attention from word to word.

Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then mantra to mantra, mantra to mantra. Moving of attention. Intra and inter mantra. Intra means within the mantra. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then inter mantra. One mantra, you hear, then again you have to task hearing another mantra. So what is the challenge in this tasking? The real challenge in the tasking is the mind starts tasking some thinking. Let's say I have to do this, I had to go here and do that, the thing, that thing, a phone call, or I had to, I have some emotional issues with somebody and you try to solve that in your mind. So all these things the mind engage disengages from tasking hearing and engages in self in hearing, in hearing the sound that is your, your thing, your own thinking. If you are thinking, you cannot hear. If you hear, you cannot think. If you are thinking during japa, you are not touching Krishna. Your soul is not in touch with Krishna. Your soul is not touching Krishna. Your soul is, that Nama is not going into it, stopping the

here at the eardrum. The sound has to go into your heart and only by hearing it will go into the heart. Just like now you are hearing what I am saying. So what I am saying is going into your heart. Some other noises are there, even though it is falling on your ears right now surrounding this for you, you are not hearing that because you are applying your attention is on what I am speaking. Similarly, our attention should be on the hearing, running the attention, just like you run to try Dinge running like that and that this is a good thing to think about you are not, your attention should run along with the chanting, Hari Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna – Hare Hare Hare Hare! It's not very complicated, we're not talking about concentration. Simply be on the sound, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare Hare, Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare! And don't do anything else. Next beat, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare Hare Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare!

**Key Quote:** "Hearing will push out the thinking."
**Summary:** The speaker encourages focusing on hearing the mantra to push out thinking and uses the analogy of iron in a fire to illustrate the importance of continuous association with the sound.

All this should be stopped by simply hearing what you chant. Okay? You don't try to stop thinking, rather you focus on hearing. Hearing will push out the thinking. And if you observe, you can experience yourself, take it as a challenge to yourself, non-stop without any thinking, one hearing over another hearing, one mantra over another mantra, one mantra over another mantra, one mantra over another mantra, without any thinking. Even 108 rounds, 108, one mala you do and see what is the effect of this piling up hearing over hearing over hearing. Because Krishna himself, by touching him, just like you take a piece of iron put in the fire, it becomes red hot slowly. Okay? But you take the iron, put inside the fire for two minutes, take it out again, again put it for two minutes, again take it out, again put it inside, take it out. Even after a hundred years, will the iron become red hot? No. Now our chanting is like this. We hear one mantra, then mind goes thinking, we are out of the fire. Then again, oh, oh, I have to hear, you hear, you again go inside.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of consciously directing attention to the sound of the mantra, comparing it to showing respect to a guest and highlighting inattentiveness as an offense.

So do you want to experience the fire of Satyacitta Ananda? Then you have to consciously task, what is the task? Keep your attention. Keep your attention on the sound as the sound is appearing. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. It's a question of training the mind. And then afterwards, once you do little effort to only hear, then that to lock the mind on hearing, the Shakti comes from the Nama himself, from the Hare Krishna. The Hare Krishna mantra himself, it will lock. It is the mercy of the Lord when, if the Lord, Nama Prabhu allows you to lock. Because you are staying in the fire, you'll get purified. Therefore, it is said, one of the ten offenses is to be inattentive while chanting. Prabhupada says, the sound is Krishna. Be very careful. God is right there before you. Please give attention. Don't neglect. Don't be disrespectful. Giving attention is a first respect. If a guest comes in your house, and you ignore, you don't give attention, you act as if he is not there, isn't it an insult? In the same way, you don't give attention. In the same way you invoke Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare and you are roaming around everywhere else. Your mind is roaming everywhere without hearing. It is an offence. It is an insult. On the other hand, if you are very careful and hearing, the Nama Prabhu becomes very happy and very pleased and He will bestow upon you Sat, Chitta and Ananda Shakti in

**Key Quote:** "Hearing means fire is going into your heart. The fire of Satya, Chitta and Ananda."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that concentration in japa means doing only one thing - hearing - and that attention is a tool that can be controlled to invite the Lord into the heart, bringing the fire of eternity, knowledge, and bliss.

So concentration means a task to ensure that I don't do anything else. Doing only one thing, it is called also concentration. Seeing only one thing. One point on the wall, that is seeing concentration. Japa is doing concentration. You do only one thing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing. Hearing is a doing. That means doing, why hearing is a doing also? Because you have to handle your attention. Your attention is under your control. Not only that. Now you have decided to listen to what I am speaking. That means you have controlled your attention to hear what I am saying. So attention is in your control. Usually we, the mind takes our attention, wherever the mind takes my attention, I am also going, but actually attention is your property. You can decide. You can tell the mind. No, not here, here. Attention is a carrier. Mind is a carrier of attention. Be here now. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Krishna, string over, then Hare Rama string, Hare Krishna over, Hare Rama, one bead over, one bead over, one bead over, one bead over, one bead over. Hearing means fire is going into your heart. The fire of Satya, Chitta and Ananda. The fire of eternity, knowledge and bliss is going into your heart. In the example, we put the iron in the fire. God is so merciful. Our soul is like iron. Krishna is so merciful, so kind that he descends through our ears, into our heart. Fire is coming to you. The fire of Satya and Ananda is coming to you. So if you don't hear, then you are not inviting the Lord into your heart.

Okay. So chanting is like inviting the Lord, invoking the Lord, please come. I want to serve you. I want your association by hearing you. So the Lord comes as a sound incarnation, you have to welcome and embrace him by hearing. Hearing is equal to embracing Krishna's sound body. There's no difference between. There's no difference between Krishna's sound body and Krishna himself. So such is the power, purifying power of the Hare Krishna, hearing the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Your spiritual advancement depends upon how many Hare Krishnas you have heard in your life. You may chant many Hare Krishnas that will give you Punya or that will give you, mechanically chanting will give you some benefit. Okay. Benefit. But you want Bhakti, then you have to touch the Lord. You have to hear him, then only you will get purified. So with these few words, we'll continue our Pyat.

Many times I have given a summary talk on soulful japa. So now onwards, on our Ekadashi, I will deal with the cards, the cue cards that we have made. How best to utilize these cue cards? These cue cards are ultimately the content. In these cue cards, the intellectual content, the spiritual content, the emotional content has to enter our subconscious mind by repeated reflection and contemplation. Once it enters our subconscious, then it creates a wonderful, wonderful background to our chanting and hearing in the foreground. The foreground mind will be chanting and hearing and tasking. The background mind will be relating with the Nama Prabhu who is before us. This is the basic premise of Nama Prabhu.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on training the mind for soulful japa, distinguishing between foreground and background mind activities, and introduces the concept of mindful japa with shraddha.

Soulful japa. Soulful japa means whole mind japa. Both foreground mind and background mind. Then there is complete absorption in Nama Prabhu. Our full mind is foreground mind and background mind. So we should train our mind, not only in foreground chanting and hearing, but also train the mind in background mind to have only matters which are glories of the holy name, matters which are feelings about the relationship with the holy name, the bhavanas, the feelings about the holy name. So that part of the training is what is designed through these cards. These are all manifestations from Srila Prabhupada and Nama Prabhu, these cards. It has very deep meaning. Ultimately our mind, there are three stages of perfecting japa: Mindful japa, Spiritful japa, and Soulful japa. Mindful japa is when you give your complete mind to chanting and hearing, and feeling his presence in the background mind, Nama Prabhu's presence. In other words, chanting and hearing and tasking with shraddha is mindful japa.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritful japa means not only mind, you chant with joy, excitement, enthusiasm."
**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa explains the difference between spiritful and soulful japa, highlighting the importance of joy and enthusiasm in chanting, and relating to the holy name.

Then, Spiritful japa. Spiritful japa means not only mind, you chant with joy, excitement, enthusiasm, heartfully, liking to chant. So mindful chanting, mindful japa plus preeti, aglada, hrstam, utsaha, these are all, you know, you have to offer from your spirit. You have to be happy about chanting. You have to be enthusiastic about chanting. You have to joyfully chant, happily chant, enthusiastically repeat. These are all feelings, enthusiasm, joy, happily doing, which means this comes from the spirit. Mindful japa is more like controlling your mind. It's a technique. Don't go here in their mind, only here. That is mindful japa. Spiritful japa means you start giving your spirit. Then soulful japa means chanting in relation to the mind. So, this is the spiritual relationship with the holy name, like sambandha, saranagati, kripapeksha, it is like talking to the Nama Prabhu. Kripapeksha, vinamrtha, all these other cards up to sixteen cards.

So, the essence of all this is in the golden command. So, today let us just go through the golden command so that you get familiarized with this card. This one card a hundred times you should read, think, contemplate, reflect intellectually, physically, and mentally. This is the golden command.

Hear what you chant without any thinking activity, because if you do thinking activity, you cannot hear, hearing is very important. Even if the thinking activity is about the philosophy of Krishna consciousness, no, hear. If you are thinking of the philosophy of Krishna consciousness, then you are not hearing. Krishna has come before you, wanting to be heard. So that the golden command of Srila Prabhupada, Chant Hare Krishna, and exactly the same sound you hear.

Krishna is within and without of everything. Any devotee who cryingly chants, Lord is on his tongue for sure, 100%. Mechanically chanting, you should cryingly chant. If you are materially satisfied, you cannot cry. Your heart cannot cry. You feel everything nicely settled, your heart cannot cry. And then this understanding has to be there to hear. Your soul is touching Krishna who has come. That is the only way for us to get sacchidanandaized or develop the same quality as Krishna. So that is the first secret. Chant. First secret

**Summary:** The second secret of soulful japa is introduced: task hearing over previous hearing, explained through the analogy of heating a piece of iron, and the concept of 'Ejna' as an offering to Krishna.

is hear what you chant. Second secret, task hearing over previous hearing. One mantra hearing is over. Before its effect is over, put on the next one. That means you pile up. You should not be in between the mantras, something else. You should not think. Your attention should be piling up one hearing over another hearing. That can happen only if you do that work, tasking. Tasking means it is a work. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama, even in tasking next, put the next one on top. Hear one after the other and hear one after the other, build up. One Hare Krishna chanting you do, that association, let's say it gives you some warmth. It's energy. Before that cools off, next one should be there. Before that next one, before. Suppose you take a piece of iron, put in the fire, becomes heated, you take it out. It will become cool. Again you put it inside, it will become hot. Again you take it out. Put it outside, become cool. But you keep it inside only, what will happen? Heat will build up, build up, build up. That is what meaning, task, hearing over previous hearing. Hearing over previous hearing. This will ensure that no thinking activity will happen. Offer tasking of hearing as a doing, yajna. This is an yajna. It is pleasing to Krishna, this is a offering to Krishna. This is a giving and receiving. So if someone wants to go there, he will be heard. That is all. But you have to get the gift of hearing. Pay attention to this. Yajna. Doesn't mean, someone has to take your hand, but do you have to be careful about this? Yajna.

**Summary:** The third secret involves heart talk or Bhavana, defined as thought-feeling, and the importance of Shraddha as a truth narrative, believing Krishna is present as the hearable sound.

Yajna. Your chanting, your foreground mind, your background mind should be indulging in heart talk. Heart talk about the glories of the holy name or heart talk about my relationship with Nama Prabhu. Heart talk is another word for Bhavana. Bhavana does not mean feeling alone. Bhavana is a thought feeling. Behind the feeling there is a thought. A thought you are convinced about. A belief is there, and then the feeling is there. Shraddha is a Bhavana, is a heart talk. Just like you say, okay, you offer Shraddha to Nama Prabhu. Then you explain, what is more? What is this? How do I offer Shraddha? Shraddha is a heart talk. Heart talk is feelingly the narrative that Krishna is present before me. Read the first line. Offer in the background mind my emotionalized TRP narratives called Bhavana. What is TRP? Truth, relationship and purpose. We will explain what? Bhavana or heart talks. Truth narrative is during japa. Truth narrative is called Shraddha. Shraddha that Krishna himself has incarnated before me on each bead as his persona of Shakti Avesha Nama. See Nama Prabhu. This is a simple matter of fact. Faith. Matter of truth. Absolute truth.

**Key Quote:** "So spiritual life is all about Shraddha. It is about talk."
**Summary:** The speaker continues to define Shraddha as fundamental, emphasizing the soul's ability to talk and align with narratives, and introduces Preeti as the relationship narrative.

As soon as I am chanting Krishna who is within and without of everything has come before me as the hearable, chantable sound, is manifest, is pratyeksha, immediately. So that truth, that feeling is called Shraddha. Shraddha is fundamental. Any other Bhavana is not there also. Shraddha is fundamental. That is why I said even in mindful chanting Shraddha is a must. Without Shraddha mindful chanting is like a mechanical chant. Mechanically you may hear every word that you are chanting because of the mind control. You control the mind that each sound is captured. But Shraddha, why each sound you should take inside because he is Krishna himself has come before me. That is Shraddha. So that is a heart talk. Shraddha is a heart talk. See the soul in this material world in this body, trapped in this material world, trapped as in Indra. One of the faculties that the soul, even now most powerful faculty of the soul is its ability to talk. Remember that. Not ability to think, not ability to see, it is ability to talk. So spiritual life is all about Shraddha. It is about talk. Your mind immediately aligns with the talk, narrative. That is why I call this as narrative. Bhavana is nothing but emotionalized and intellectualized narrative, narrative of something you are convinced about. So that is Shraddha. So there is a narrative of truth. There is a narrative of relationship. What is my relationship with Nama? That narrative is Preeti, of respectful intimacy towards him. That is a relationship. That is also a originate. It originates in a sound of the soul, in talk of the soul.

Heart talk. Vajatam Preeti Purvakam. Preeti is a thought feeling, both intellectually, emotionally. It has to be fed into your subconscious through your conscious mind by repeatedly contemplating on it, reflecting on it. How there is no one who loves me more than Krishna. Krishna loves all living entities. Therefore it is natural for me to love him, to offer love to him. Preeti. I have Preeti towards Nama Prabhu. I have Preeti towards Krishna, who is so kind and mercifully coming before me as his Shabda persona, as his Nama persona. So little intellectualizing is required. Why I should have Preeti? That is intellectualization. So in order to put any bhavana into your heart, you have to be convinced. A strong belief. A strong belief of truth has to be there. A strong belief of my relationship with Nama Prabhu. So truth narrative of Nama Prabhu, relationship narrative of Nama Prabhu, and then there is purpose. The purpose is, my purpose narrative is loving him and receiving his Satchidananda association to awaken my love for him. So this is the fundamental.

Shraddha and Preeti. When you read this again and again, then you will speak from your heart these very same things. It becomes emotionalized further. I should accompany every bead of my japa with any one of my heart talks or bhavanas of Vinamrta. They are all heart talks only. It's all sound only. It's all your conviction. You're convinced and emotionally strong statements of your soul. Vimrta. Vinamrta. So many statements that is there. That is what all the six cards will tell about, the talk, that I am insignificant before you. I possess nothing, etc. The cards are all meant for instilling this conviction, belief, that you are nothing before God. God is everything. That Vinamrta feeling are those six cards. And you go on repeating those, reading those cards. What is that Vinamrta that enters your heart? No pain, no gain. Your japa, if you follow these things, it will become super, super. Even I am trying to follow. My japa has not become any super, but I know if you follow this, it becomes super. I can write these things because Nama Prabhu is inspiring me, but to practice these things, it will take years. But if you practice these things, then where our spiritual consciousness will be. Hrstam. Why you should be happily chanting. There are reasons. When you are happy, there are reasons why you are happy. So that is intellectualizing, and then emotionalize. Intellectualizing is thought, thought feeling. Feeling means emotionalize.

Every emotion is a thought feeling. That is meaning of Bhavana. Persona of Shri Nama Prabhu. My relationship narrative is Preeti, a respectful intimacy towards him. My purpose narrative is serving him and receiving his Satchitananda association to awaken my love for him. I should accompany every bead of my japa with any one of the heartbeats, any one of the heart talks of Bhavana. See, when so many Bhavana's you hear and you understand and you put it in your heart, afterward japa becomes Sadbhavana japa or soulful japa. Becomes very easy. You don't have to indulge your thinking capacity to load those Bhavana because so many Bhavana's are there. Vinamrta, Rishtam. On each bead there should be a Bhavana because on each bead Krishna is appearing. Receiving him with, receive him with Bhavana. Serve him with Bhavana.

**Summary:** The speaker uses Vinamrta as an example of how to use the cards, emphasizing the importance of understanding the intellectual truth and then feeling it, and reiterates the three secrets of the golden card.

Now these are all the things that are explained in the rest of the cards. So take for instance Vinamrta. Let's say six seven cards are there. So once all those six seven cards you read repeatedly and then feel for it, then Vinamrta feeling will automatically come. You don't have to bring all those six cards. Something of that will come into the surface. So much abundant feelings you have. Six. Out of that one will understand Vinamrta. So what does Vinamrta mean? That is the first thing you should understand by reading those cards. Go on hearing that. Then automatically that will, that meaning will. For instance Krishna is source of everything. I do not possess anything. I do not own anything. Everything that I have is given by him. Now this is an intellectual truth. It's a true intellectual fact. But as you go on telling this intellectual fact, what will happen? Feeling also will come. Is it not? I did not possess anything. The feeling that Krishna is a possessor Bhagavan of everything. Feeling also will come. So go on repeating this content in these cards, both intellectually and emotionally. You will see that they become part of your subconscious. It is part of your relationship with Namaprabhu. So this is the golden secret card. At least this secret card till next Ekadashi, please all of you take a copy of this from Indrapati and just understand. Later on we will go into what is Vinamruta and law, step by step. What are the three secrets? Hear and chant. Hear your chant. Then task hearing over hearing. Pile up hearing over hearing. Then you will see unlimited ways of relating with the Namaprabhu is there by heart talk.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of heart talk in each japa, with Shraddha as the minimum, and outlines the plan to delve deeper into each Bhavana in future sessions.

At least one heart talk should be there in each japa. That means your background is also completely involved in beat after beat. Minimum heart talk is Shraddha. So next 15 days till next Ekadashi, practice Shraddha. So first six cards of Shraddha also you can practice, or you can go slow. First practice these three things, golden card for next till next Ekadashi. Then the next Ekadashi when I do or whenever next Japa Yajna I do, I will talk about the six cards of Shraddha, and the next Ekadashi, each Ekadashi, I will deal with one one Bhavana.

to sleep, the manifestation of Krishna. So if somebody wants to serve God, then one need not think in his mind, "Where is God to receive my service? How do I know He is receiving my service?" All that to learn from guru, sadhu, shastra, that Krishna receives our service immediately. How much relationship we want with God, God is ready to give Himself to us. Krishna's only business is to be with His devotees, to be aware of His devotees, to show mercy to His devotees, show love to His devotees. And therefore, devotees' only business is always to think of Krishna, always serve Him. Krishna being absolute, there is no limitation for Him, and He decides, "I am the deity," is deity, and He decides, "I am the sound that you chant." It's Him. And Krishna is He is surya of satchidananda. Krishna means Krishna, the Supreme Personality with the supreme energies. Both Krishna and His energies incarnate in Kali Yuga, kalikale nama rupe krishnavatara. They descend in the most accessible manner. Simply you have to move your tongue and God is right there. How to recognize Him? How to feel Him? He is there. That is something that you will achieve by doing that, by hearing from guru, sadhu, shastra, hearing from Prabhupada, that Krishna, what is His omnipotency? Why He will be convinced? Yes, because we are all dear to Krishna, one Krishna, one Supreme Personality of Godhead. We are all His amshas, we all His namsa. So therefore, this chanting is not ordinary activity, this chanting of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra and hearing the Hare Krishna maha-mantra.

So, improving the japa means moving from mindless japa to mindful japa, then to spiritful japa, then to soulful japa. It is a question of practice. If we do not consciously take care, because of the nature of the mind, our japa will be mindless japa. Mindless japa is just tongue japa. Only tongue you are giving to Krishna. Not giving your consciousness, not giving your mind, not giving your ears. So, mindless japa is very... It is offensive japa. You are doing japa, but you are neglecting to hear. You are neglecting to give your mind to the nama of the Lord. You are neglecting to give your mind to the avatara who is before us and all these different stages of good quality chanting, good quality japa has to be practiced in a systematic way.

All these words are important. If you learn immediately, the concept will come into your memory. Capsulized japa means mantra by mantra, bead by bead japa.

14.4 O Nama Prabhu Krishna, my gratitude for enlightening me once for all. The bursting of fake rasa bubbles of material lust in the mind. Rasa of independent power, knowledge, love. These all you have to meditate upon. You have to read, understand. 10-15 times repetition is required, ideas. So when you are repeating. If you are grasping the idea that is enough, then you don't have to memorize it. Memorizing is automatic when you are repeating it for long time. For 2 months you are repeating, everyday you are reading 2 times this morning and evening. it automatically it will go into your system so even memorizing idea is a goal but even the idea you don't have to memorize you have to repeat the idea just like how you memorize the word in a shloka how do you memorize the sound you're repeating the sound here you have to simply repeat the idea by reading it read feel the idea if the idea is not clear then you think it's called mananam you think about the idea oh what is in this card what is this idea think about it because once you think then there is an understanding some things you don't understand when you don't understand you have to think about it oh what is being told here use your buddhi that is called mananam ah now i understand now i understand mananam repeat that day after day day after day that idea then dhyanam dhyanam is when you that that idea becomes a feeling then anusheelanam means you are practi during japa you are chanting hearing with that feeling for instance you can decide this one I have understood this one card now today's 16th round i'm going to do with this offering from my background mind 14.5 my gratitude for realization about two kinds of pleasures material pleasure and spiritual pleasure sacred shares shreyas prasadam all this

**Key Quote:** "Reasoning is there, feeling is there, anusilana. Anusilana means in the japa you practice."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the SMDA technique (Shravanam, Mananam, Dhyanam, Anusilana) as a structured approach to training the mind for Soulful Japa, emphasizing the importance of understanding, feeling, and practicing the concepts during japa.

requires explanation. That will be there, one page explanation. The process I am telling. I have nothing to do with naham, nirmama, nothing to do with preyas, rasas or false dual egos, kama bija, kama bhavana, kama apeksha, kama sankalpa, kama karya, kama vasana, kama drishti. So a little advanced, but it's all philosophy of Krishna consciousness from Prabhupada's books. 14.6, you see now. This is what I have said. It is called SMDA technique. Shravanam, that is first reading. Then you don't understand. Then you do mananam. You understand what is written. And when you understand everything, this is all about bhavanas. The bhavana that comes out of that understanding, will manifest. That you have to repeat. That is called dhyana. That you have to repeat. 14.7 So that thought becomes thought plus feeling. When you do mananam it becomes a thought. The idea is there. Mananam becomes a thought feeling when you repeat the idea several times. Just like why you are grateful. That one of the cards you take. That idea, oh, I'm grateful because of this, because of the mananam. When you're convinced, when it becomes a conviction, it starts becoming a feeling. Every feeling requires a reasoning. You always have, if you have to get angry, there has to be a reasoning behind that. Is it not? So that reasoning, so before it becomes a bhavana, you have to have reasons. That is mananam. Understand the philosophy, that particular point, mananam. Then dhyanam is, that feelings are repeated. And then already feelings are there, reasoning. Reasoning is there, feeling is there, anusilana. Anusilana means in the japa you practice. As I said, take one card and today I will do this one card, today's japa. First you read all these dusravanam and all these anusilana. Last 96 days of your training, last three months, take one card because you already read several times, one card. And do it. Hold 16 rounds, you take that one card. Next day you take that, like that. Then this practice has no end. Second year again you can start. Third year again you can start. And in three, four years, you're complete, your consciousness, you're doing japa, you're completely in relationship with the Holy Name. No more mindless chanting. No more mechanical chanting. You will enjoy being with Krishna for the, for the whole

**Key Quote:** "When you desire, you speak to the Nama, it becomes fulfilled."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by expressing gratitude and explaining that Nama is Chintamani, a touchstone that fulfills desires, emphasizing the importance of maintaining spiritual desires and communicating with Nama Prabhu through the language of feeling.

Hare Krishna Nama Prabhu Ki. Let us thank Nama Prabhu for protecting our devotional service, protecting our service to Srila Prabhupada, protecting our service to the wonderful, most merciful deities of the Hare Krishna hill. Shishi Radha Krishna Chandra Ki Jai. Shishi Krishna Balaram Ki Jai. Shishi Radha Krishna Chandra Ki Jai. Shri Buddha Shri Krishna Madhyagana Ki Jai. Shri Lifesa подобya Ki Jai. Shri Nama Prabhu Ki Jai. Hare Krishna Nama Prabhu is also, whole Nama is also called Chintamani Nama, Nama Chintamani. Chintamani means touchstone. Touchstone means anything you touch with your desire. Yes, become gold, it will become gold. It is a touchstone, Chintamani. Nama is Chintamani. When you desire, you speak to the Nama, it becomes fulfilled. But we should be careful as devotees, we should maintain our relationship to only seek spiritual desires. Is it not? Because somebody is very powerful and you go and ask him, give me this that he is not happy with, you will spoil your relationship. Right? The fact is that this is Nama. He can give anything. Nama can give you anything. So devotees are in difficulty. They have nowhere to go. They always go to Nama Prabhu. They talk to Nama Prabhu during japa. I told you talking is not by language or not by words. What is the language of talking to Nama Prabhu? Feeling. If somebody stands, if somebody comes before you and if he is in danger, looking at his face, you can make out. That is language of? Feeling. So with Nama Prabhu, all these are language of feeling. Gratitude, surrender, Vinamrita, Krita Jnana, Kripa Apeksha, Seva Apeksha. Nama Prabhu catches your feeling during japa. Catches your feeling.

### Hear Submissively to Change Old Perceptions | Sri Madhu Pandit Dasa | SB 3.22.10 | 07.08.2024

#### hearing from authority, personal understanding, faith

**Key Quote:** "Hearing from an authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding."
**Summary:** This segment introduces the core principle that hearing from a spiritual authority provides a superior experience compared to relying solely on personal understanding.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, 10-3, Chapter 22, Entitled The Marriage of Kardamamuni and Devahuti, Verse No. 10: YADATU BHAVATASILA SHRUTA RUPA VAYO DUNAN ASHRANON NARADHA DESHA TVAYAYA SITRITANISHAYA. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "The moment she heard from the sage Narada of your noble character, learning, beautiful appearance, youth and other virtues, she fixed her mind upon you." Purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "The girl Devahuti did not personally see Kardamamuni, nor did she personally experience his character or qualities, since there was no social intercourse by which she could gain such understanding. But she heard about Tridamamuni from the authority of Narada Muni. Hearing from an authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding. She heard from Narada Muni that Tridamamuni was just fit to be her husband, therefore she became fixed in her heart that she would marry him, and she expressed her desire to her father who therefore brought her before him." Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Parvat. Devahuti, the daughter of Swayambhuva Manu, came to fix her mind upon desiring Kardamamuni, is being explained by Manu, and it is specifically explained in the purport by Prabhupada that she knew about Kardamamuni only by hearing from Narada Muni. And by hearing from Narada Muni about Kardamamuni, she got a better experience than even gaining personal understanding. So this principle, hearing from an authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding, is a very heavy principle being made here. Thank you. Generally, this does not appeal to common sense. One will think that first I should hear and then I should experience. In spiritual life also we have a tendency, because that is how our mind works. Now I am reading these things, one day I will directly experience. But that is completely being, that process is completely being countered by the statement of Prabhupada. Hearing from an authority is a better experience than gaining personal understanding. We have to believe it. It does not appeal to common sense. It is a very heavy principle.

#### hearing Krishna, seeing Krishna, spiritual sound, spiritual world

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Because if you happen to see Krishna, if you are not pure, you are not able to understand Krishna."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the principle by comparing hearing about Krishna from a pure source to seeing Krishna directly, emphasizing the importance of purity and the nature of spiritual sound.

It does not appeal to common sense. This is relative. Which is better? Just like which is better, hearing about Krishna or seeing Krishna? According to this, if you hear from an authority about Krishna, it is better than seeing Krishna. Because if you happen to see Krishna, if you are not pure, you are not able to understand Krishna. If you are pure then you will think, "Oh, maybe somebody from some drama party has come before me," even if he is genuine Krishna. Now, hearing Krishna purely, there are different ways of hearing about Krishna. The source should be pure. Now let's go into this hearing experience. Number one, source should be pure here because Narada spoke. The hearer should be submissive, because only when you are submissive then the perception will go into your subconscious. At the conscious level, your hearing is always being analyzed and judged. Real hearing is not analyzing and judging. Submissive hearing means allowing that sound to enter you and that sound will expand, that perception expand the meaning of the shabda. One should have faith that this shabda is transcendental. Of course, Prabhupada is talking about transcendental hearing, which is, you know, in our normal world, what is it? It's the other way around. You hear something and then you hear about America and go and see America. That is correct in the relative world, it is correct. But in the spiritual world it's not like that, not spiritual hearing, nor during our sadhana stage, it is not like that. Anything to do with spiritual shabda is not that. One has to have faith that the spiritual shabda is impregnated with the meaning of that shabda, what multi-dimensional meaning that are all contained in it. If I use a word, if I say pen, in that word pen, in the material world, pen is not there. In the spiritual shabda, say Hare or Krishna or Rama, in that shabda, Hare is there, Krishna is there, Rama is there. There is no difference between shabda and the personality of that shabda, because everything is personality. Prabhupada gives example in the spiritual world also. Water, water, you say. You have water. Whether your thirst should be quenched or not, that water should mercifully decide. Here you put water on the tongue, there is no question of not getting quenched, because the water here is just matter. It has to. But in the spiritual world, water is a person.

**Key Quote:** "So spiritual hearing means you have to remove the shutter of rational mind."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the power of the Hare Krishna mantra and the importance of submissive hearing, which involves removing the filters of the rational mind to allow for spiritual transformation.

So you say water, water, water. That is why it is said, Atta, Ashi, Krishna, Nama, Naba, Naba, Ved, Gra. Mahim, Indriya. Anything in the spiritual world you cannot capture. Everything is a person. There has to be a relationship. You say water, water, water. Water is not different from water. But that water decides, "Personality, or I should keep this person thirsty?" You decide to keep thirsty. To quench the thirst or not to quench the thirst is the decision of the personality of water. But it is not different. So in the same way, the holy name, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. If the shabda is there, then automatically we should automatically become pure in a moment, because it is Krishna himself I am touching. No, he is a person. You deserve, you qualify. Are you begging? What is your mood? Have you fed up with material world? Are you ready to experience me? No, all those things. Yes. Now I will purify you. Cheto-darpanam. Cheto-darpanam marjanam. That too, if you are hearing, is a relationship. Oh, and where is the question of, you know, even Cheto-darpanam marjanam, this fellow is completely offensive, this jiva. He is utilizing my name for so many things. He thinks I can, you know, I can be used for everything. For his power, knowledge, fame, everything, he can use Harinam. So will Harinam respond? Will not respond. Harinam will not. He will respond. He will respond. He will respond appropriately. But the fact is that the Lord is there. Nama Incarnation is there. The Nama Incarnation, the specific character is there. He is very, very merciful. The most merciful incarnation is Nama Incarnation, which is brought down by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And this Hare Krishna Maha Mantra is non-different from Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Radha Krishna Anya. This mantra is nothing but the personalities of Radha and Krishna. So spiritual hearing means you have to remove the shutter of rational mind. Submissively one should hear. Submissively and faithfully one should hear. It's a big, it's a very big transformative power, transformative process that we are all possessing.

**Key Quote:** "Realization is when it goes into your subconscious."
**Summary:** This segment explores how to effectively read Prabhupada's books to allow the knowledge to penetrate the subconscious mind, leading to genuine realization and transformation.

How to read Prabhupada's books? How to read Prabhupada's books so that it enters your subconscious? Conscious mind, we are constantly filtering it. How does something go into the subconscious when you are very emotional? Isn't it? That is how people get trauma and all, isn't it? The situation is charged with emotions, your subconscious opens. That is how you say, "By this experience I learnt." It opens. Otherwise rational mind will not, your lesson will just remain there, and in few days it will go away. Whatever you learn with your rational mind, so much logic you will tell and this is that, this is that, it will remain for two, three days and it will go away. Those things are not called realizations. Realization is when it goes into your subconscious, and there it brings about permanent change in your perception, permanent change in your attitude towards life. So how to make this shabda of Prabhupada enter into our subconscious? As I said, one of the things is to stop this, remove the shutter of rational filter that we have, where we analyze and judge everything. No doubt when you first came to Srila Prabhupada's books, you are trying to read everything, you understand, you are questioning how Krishna is God or this or that, everything. I mean you are reading everything. How Krishna is God, why Krishna is God, all these things, your rational mind. But actually that answer to your rational mind is not what made you devotee, by the way. Because how Krishna is God, why Krishna is God, you will never find the proof in the Bhagavad Gita. It is not a book of proof. It is a book of declaration.

**Key Quote:** "It is a book of declaration."
**Summary:** This segment explains that the Bhagavad Gita is not a book of logical proof but a declaration of truth, and that faith is awakened through hearing from a spiritual authority.

Krishna is going on saying, "I am God, I am God." And he is saying so many authorities have told, "I am God." There is no evidence there given. Universal form, yeah, you can say that, universal form. Universal form also, you know, so many people can show also. I heard some magicians and all can show universal form. Logical, rational evidence. So you think, "Oh, I rationally understood." No. By reading, by submissively, repeatedly hearing, Prabhupada's mercy, Krishna's mercy entered your heart, your subconscious. You got that? Yes. So much so that, that becomes an evidence for you. What is that? Krishna's own statement has become evidence. You don't ask any further questions. Yes. That's how it has become. Now when we read Bhagavad Gita, what is the evidence you see? "Oh, Krishna is saying he is God. I am very happy. Oh, Krishna is saying. Krishna. Krishna is saying. Krishna is saying." This is all our evidence now. But when we were karmicists, it don't become evidence. Anybody can declare he is God. No? You use your rational mind. You don't resolve it. But what made you devotee, what made every one of us devotees, is the power of the shabdha of Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada and the Krishna's statement that entered our heart. It has entered our heart. It has got the potency to awaken our original faith. Faith is not created. To create a faith now you need rationality. Suppose that faith is part and parcel of your existence. Who is my father? If that faith is part and parcel, it is a constitutional fact for the jiva. It is a question of not logical proof, it is a question of awakening. That awakening has come by hearing Srila Prabhupada's books.

#### Bhagavad Gita, reading process, faith, descending analysis

**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Build first of all faith."
**Summary:** This segment shares a personal story about reading the Bhagavad Gita and emphasizes the importance of building faith before engaging in analytical study.

And how is that then? Is there a method by which we can actually make this enter? In my own story, very easily I can say. When I got Bhagavad Gita As It Is, first time, I did not know why I followed that process. I followed that process. Something was so nice. I went on reading very fast. Did not say to analyze and all. That means whatever was going inside, was going inside. Whatever I did not understand, I didn't try to. Like this for long time, Gita, going on, reading, reading. Because it was very tasty because Krishna is, Prabhupada is repeatedly saying. So what Prabhupada is saying? Largely I was concentrating on the purports of Prabhupada, not even connecting the verses of Krishna's. I was just going on reading the Bhagavad Gita, purport, purport, purport, purport, purport, purport. Going on reading the purports. Sometimes the verse also I would skip. Going on reading the purports. So something entered me, because there you are not trying to analyze at that stage. I am not saying you should not analyze, you should not study. That is another process. That is, we have to have control over our faith. We have to have so much faith. Build first of all faith, and have a paradigm of descending analysis. What is descending analysis? This is 100% correct. Not speculative analysis. Descending process analysis. This what is told is correct. I want to understand how it is correct. I know it is correct. Conclusion I have adopted. But I would like to relish how it is correct. Additional bonus. It is correct. So that way, this is the way in which the Shastras are also studied with rational mind, because it has got, everything has got rationality behind it. But rationality in the beginning does not make this enter you, enter your system. Faith. Faithful hearing is required. Submissive hearing is required.

**Key Quote:** "Your paradigm shifts."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how submissive hearing can lead to a shift in paradigms, which are the perspectives stored in our subconscious mind, and introduces the concept of OPSA (Objects, People, Situations, Actions) as the content of our minds.

So if some transformation has to happen, this is submissive hearing. Sometimes you hear, you are very submissively sitting in the class, you hear something. It goes and penetrates your subconscious. Your paradigm shifts, because all these paradigms are nothing but perspectives which we have stored in our subconscious. How we see things. How we see people. How we see situations. Right? Our mind is full of three things. Three or four things you can see. If you take in mind, it contains in that box, there are four things: perception of things. Here you see a camera. You see a kartal. You see this thing. Things, things. Room. Building. You have mapped those buildings into it. That is perception of things. Then there is perception of people. What do I think of this person? This person? This person? This person? Right? This person is a man. This person is a woman. You see. Or this person is a nice person. This person is a bad person. He is friend. He is enemy. So perception of people. Then there is perception of situation. Is it not? Continuously full of these things. Say today you are going out preaching. It is a preaching situation. It is a compound. You get at a glance. Just like I say guru issue. Moment I say guru issue, it is a situation. So many things you will derive out of it. What is guru issue? I tell you. Give me. What is this guru issue? If I ask you to come here, you will stand and you will describe what it is. Actually you are describing what you have, your perception. Is it not? So perception of things, people, situation, and actions. You also perceive actions. Sinful activity. Not sinful activity. Is it not? Actions. Good act. Bad act. Actions. Here there is a fight. There is a situation. And in the situation there is an action of a fight. So there is an action. So object, people, situations, and actions. O. P. S. A. Our head consists of only O. P. S. A.

**Key Quote:** "The primary feeling that we all paste is priti and apriti."
**Summary:** This segment explains how our perceptions are pasted with feelings of like and dislike (priti and apriti), and how our free will influences these attachments and aversions, leading to iccha (desire) and dvesha (aversion).

Now these perceptions, these perceptions are also pasted with feelings. Is it not? Take an object. I like this object. I don't like this object. The primary feeling that we all paste is priti and apriti. Like. Dislike. I like this camera. I don't like this camera. Or I like this camera. I don't like. I don't like something. There are so many dislikes. Objects. Persons. Again there you see. We paste. I like this person. I don't like this person. Then situations. You like and don't like. Yes or no? Prasadam all. Prasadam. You like that situation. If you are called by authority to be chastised, you don't like that situation. Oh. Why he is calling me? Immediately it is pasted. Automatically pasted. I don't like. Like and dislike on situation. Similarly on actions. Activity. You have a perception towards activity. Somebody is angry. You don't like. Somebody kindly treats you. You like. These are all we have put likes and dislikes and connected. Our head is full of all these things. When our free will is connected, when we use our free will, and put priti on something, like, that is called iccha. When we use our free will, and paste dislike on something, it is called dvesha. So Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, iccha dvesha is a karana for our life. That means we have got OPSA. In OPSA you have pasted like and dislike, priti and apriti, resulting in external manifestation of iccha and dvesha.

**Summary:** This segment discusses how likes and dislikes are stored in the subconscious mind, leading to attachments, and how submissive hearing can transform these attachments.

Where you have pasted priti, you like. So how much we have got. Where are these likes and dislikes pasted? It is not in the conscious mind. This is called attachment. Anything that we have pasted, like, we are attached to. No rational reason. No reasoning is required. Like means like. Now you are, you like something as a karmi. Now you are hearing from Prabhupada's book, Gita. This is not to be liked by a devotee. But when that comes up, situation comes up, you will see that you are not able to control. You like it. Shastra says you should not like it. From your heart it comes, "I like it." That is why it is in the subconscious. So like and dislike. If you want to change in your life, submissive shabda should go inside, and it is a bomb. It will change. It will change. Everything will change. So, very powerful Pravasar. Nityam Bhagavata Sevaya. We think you are sitting here for Philosophy. Philosophy. You have understood. In 6 months you have understood the entire Philosophy. If you are sitting here for Philosophy, every time, Bhagavatam class, if you are sitting for Philosophy, you should sit here for paradigm shift.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that attending Bhagavatam class should be for paradigm shift through submissive hearing, and that even the speaker can experience transformation while representing Prabhupada.

If you sit here for philosophy, nothing philosophy all, you will see that nothing is exciting, nothing new you get, because only when you get new it's interesting. That is why some devotees, why class so important? But if they are submissive hearing they are sitting, why are you sitting in the class Bhagavatam, Nityam Bhagavatam? A transcendental process works there. The speaker may not be very great, but if he represents Prabhupada, the speaker who speaks also will get transforming paradigms while speaking. The people who listen also will get paradigm which is shifting. How many people who are given class after class, they thought they got some realization? Everybody will say yes. If you start giving class you will see, because if you have to speak something you have to open your, your shutters, you have to open, you have to speak. If you have to at least speak genuinely, if you have to tell somebody, "See, we are not the body," you are telling five times. When you tell you say, "Look, I am simply telling, no, what is this? I am not this body." You will start wondering how can I realize this. So here it is, this statement is of Prabhupada is wonderful that one should, that experience in spiritual life is through hearing.

**Summary:** This segment encourages developing faith in hearing and reading, especially the Hare Krishna mantra, and emphasizes the importance of having the proper situational perception and context when chanting the holy name.

Please develop great faith in hearing, reading, hearing the shabda. Reading Prabhupada's purport is like detailed, so many things are that detailed. But Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, only same words again and again and again we are hearing. But Hare Krishna Maha Mantra actually that Hare Krishna Maha Mantra is working, it will submissively if you hear. That is why Shraddha is required, with faith you should hear. Faith in what? The Lord is there, Lord's association it is, and Lord is there. In what mood is he there? That means you should have proper perception of situation of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra in your mind. What is the situation? As soon as Nama manifests on my tongue, what is the situational perception I should have? The Lord, Lord, not simply ontologically, "Lord is there, Lord is there." You should understand this feeling, what is the feeling, what is the single feeling that you can think of the holy name who is before you? Compassion towards me, love and compassion towards me, due to whom? Due to Prabhupada, due to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, like that. Immediately these are all situational thoughts. With that situational thoughts one should serve the holy name. Holy name can be served not by seeing but by hearing and chanting attentively. So it is a relationship that you cannot have a relationship unless you have a situation in the background. The context is very important everywhere. The context is so important. It is the context that brings meaning.

**Key Quote:** "It is the context that brings meaning to everything."
**Summary:** This segment explains that context is more important than the sense objects themselves, and that the context in which we perceive something determines its meaning and impact on us.

To everything. It is not simply perceiving something. For instance, I perceive this camera. This camera, okay, it is an object. But there are so many context to it. This belongs to the temple. It is been set up now for this class. So when I see this camera, I just don't see one camera, I just see it in a context. It is meant for recording classes, all these things. So context is extremely important. It is not the, it is not in fact it is not the, let us go to the sense objects. Sense objects we may see that sense objects are very, what is it? Sense objects are the cause for all my disturbance of my senses. Yeah, it is a cause, only one of the causes. The circumstances, the context in which you see the sense object is what causes real agitation to the senses, not the sense object. Sense object is only a trigger and there are certain circumstances, context in your mind. That is why it is said, that is why the shastra says, shastra says about the context, the context of, "Do not sit alone with one's mother and sister." What is it? It is a context. No? Context are powerful. Context are more powerful than the actual sense objects. Remember this. So context, managing context is, you can manage your, managing the sense object you cannot manage. You have to manage the context.

**Key Quote:** "Managing context is you can manage your managing the sense object."
**Summary:** This segment continues to emphasize the importance of managing the context in our minds, as it is more effective than trying to directly control the senses, and highlights the role of proper association in creating pure contexts.

And where is the context? In the head. The context is in the head. You have to have purified context, pure context, not concocted context. From childhood we have been given certain context. We have to put them into our subconscious. As soon as we see a opposite sex, let's say, it just goes and sits there into our context. There is a net cognitive net inside us. It goes and sits there. The context is what gives the power and the mind cannot control that at that time. Rational mind cannot control. Intuition, feelings, these are the things that come in control. So that is the reason why the most important factor for controlling the senses is not direct control of the senses, but association, proper association. You should, proper association means proper context are there in the mind. How you see opposite sex, proper context are there in the mind, pure context are there. Where do you get from? You get from by hearing how one should see, what it is, everything is there. So when that goes into our subconscious, then naturally, spontaneously you will see in that context, you will not get agitated. If there is a context in which you get agitated, you see a person in a context, in certain other context you will get agitated, does not matter what it is. So should not think that sense of the mind is a cause for all this agitation. Sense object is a trigger. The same sense object can trigger a good concept also. Just like the shastra says, "One should see every other woman as a mother." Now it is a context. If you build that context, you will have no problem at all. Same sense object, no problem at all. So is the problem sense object or context? Context.

**Key Quote:** "You should fear the context in your mind."
**Summary:** This segment advises to fear the context in our minds rather than the sense objects themselves, and reiterates that submissive hearing is the key to changing these contexts.

Understand this. And usually what we do, tendency to think is it is a sense object and then you fear sense object. The more you fear sense object, the more it will obsess you. You should fear the context in your mind. You should fear, you should think of mind is also outside, you know, just like the sense object is outside. Next the context is also there is in you or what? No, it is a filter in the mind. So you fear the sense object, but you don't fear your context. It doesn't help. Whereas you don't fear the sense object, you have the right context, you don't have to fear anything outside. Why do you have to fear anything? Because everything is matter. But if you don't do that, if you don't get that, that is why it is said clear that these are all the principles by which this context are set inside under the guidance of the transcendental words of Bhaktivedanta Karpa spiritual master. Any questions? Hare Krishna. You mean to say context means my response to the situation is that context for example? No, context means that is why I defined first that in our mind there are so many things out of that one item is called situation, perception of situation. Perception of situation when you encounter opposite sex, what is your default situational perception? According to that responses will come. Responses are not the fundamental things. Behind the responses is the context. You have to grip the context. Context comes by submissively hearing.

**Key Quote:** "Subconscious holds the context."
**Summary:** This segment clarifies that the subconscious holds the context, which is a complex cognitive network with emotions and connections, and uses the analogy of a crown and a diamond to illustrate how context affects perception.

Context changes. Yes, changes today. So many context about this world, how you see the world situation, how you see karmis, everything. What is everything? Paradigm shift of situations. The way the karmis see the world, you don't see anymore, because you are seeing the situation differently. They are seeing the situation differently. How did that happen? Because the shabda went inside. So basically context in subconscious mind? No, no, no. Subconscious holds the context. Okay. Context is a cognitive network with emotions, connections, various things, elements are there. It is like a compound. It is not one item. Take this microphone. Neither the properties of hydrogen are oxygen, both are gases. No, the compound has another property. Is it not? It is a compound. Okay. Now in the same way the situation, the entire situation perception creates where the sense of the go and fall in that situation context. In another way you can say a crown is a context. A diamond set in that crown, does it look different? It looks different. No, it is a different. So in the same way a sense object you take and put in different context, the different contextual networks are there in our system. How does the, how that is it's a very complicated thing. You cannot rationally

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the need for rules and regulations, sense control, and tapasya (austerity) to manage the old paradigms and prevent them from influencing our actions, especially in relation to the opposite sex.

go and pick it up and put it there. Yeah, no sense object is always fitting on the primary context. We should take care by submissive hearing. While second really, if you have right context then automatically the right relationship with that sense object will come. Where is the fear? Ideally in between there are rules and regulation till the paradigm shifts. That's what I'm still, the paradigm, this, there are rules and regulations. Be very careful. This paradigm doesn't go so easily for a primary and second. It doesn't go so easily. This old paradigm of yours doesn't go so easily. So be very careful when you relate with the opposite sex. Rules and regulations are required. Sense control is required. Restraint is required. Tapasya is required, because the old paradigm will come and push. When it push you have to hold it. That's called tapas. You have to control, sense control, mind control, sama dhama, gross sense control, not allow, use your willpower to stop the old paradigm from leading it to action. Now dhama's lead you are, you please use your, you use your free will to directly to not to get influenced by the old paradigm at the mind level. These two things can be done only if we have the power to tolerate pain, which is called tapas. So these are all the Brahman has quality without tapas, Shakti without, without, without tolerating, without somebody, you know, I cannot take any pain, my mind, anything and distasteful I cannot take. That means there's got no tapasya theater. Every moment everything should be pleasing. Every moment everything should be very nice, because I have come to spiritual life, it's ananda susukkam kartam. They say tapasya is required. This is the principle of success in spiritual life to put pre T, to paste pre T on tapas. It is your free will, not Dresha on tapas. You should put each on tapas. I want to take this off to it. This will make me progress.

**Key Quote:** "We all have our own problems."
**Summary:** This segment reinforces the importance of hearing from authorities, maintaining the right context, and being selective about associations to avoid absorbing negative influences and unnecessary problems.

Adding to the purport which you explained that Devahuti heard from Narada Muni more than personally experiencing the same thing, Prabhupada also mentioned when Krishna was there, so many people saw him, but only the four, five Pandavas saw he has a supreme personality. According it, it's all cognitive net show your context wrong. Nothing you just see everything. You have a context wrong. You will see the DTS told you, you are the right context, you will see is not different from the Lord. They're adding to one more point bro, in our community also, you know, when senior devotees authority says that point in time it may not fit into our head because we cannot experience it. The faith is of missive hearing ultimately saves us then this rational thinking analyzing one point in time we have to give it up otherwise yes practically it is impossible to go to next level. Another danger in this is abuse of this hearing processes or which create danger is suppose you are friendly with somebody in the ashram, moment you are friendly what happens? Your rational shutters are lifted, judgment and all is lifted. You associate, they come and put a kid inside you, it goes inside your subconscious. Should very careful whom you are associating. Don't underestimate the process of, "No, I am very rational." Rational you may analyze the logical relationship, but the emotion is unfiltered entering you. After the person say something bad about another person, another devotee, you hear logically you have understood what this fellow told is a bluff behind the back he talked, but factually speaking your emotion somewhere you have, it has conquered you. It has put a bug in you about that person. You should be biggest choice of biggest use of jivas really is in choosing association, choosing association of one person according to context different situation, not that you have to shun anybody. Everybody's associate with the person starts gossiping you should run away. What did I not come here for gossip? I have my own problems. We all have our own problems or not? Every body's share my words or no problems. Whenever somebody asks you how are you or listen you mind you should say, "I'm not fine, my senses are harassing you. I'm not fine. I'm not fine." You all have our own problems till we die. Why you should take others problems? Jai for the Lord and the whole world. Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Jai Yagat Gurshila pravupāda ki Jai.

### How the Principle of Gurutva Functions Universally | Sri Madhu Pandit Dasa | SB 3.22.8 | 06.08.2024

#### guru-disciple relationship, humility, prayer
**Timestamp:** https://youtu.be/YgfS_Iid9sM?t=0

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Swayambhuva Manu was concerned about getting his daughter married and obviously he had in his mind Karadvama Muni."
**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa begins by reciting and translating a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Swayambhuva Manu's humble approach to Karadvama Muni, highlighting the importance of respect and grace in the guru-disciple relationship.

om namo bhagavate vasudevaya om namo bhagavate vasudevaya Madbhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 22, Text 8 sabhavandh trasneha pariklishthatmano mama srotam arhasi dhinasya shravitam kripaya mune Translation in purport by S. D. V. Bhai Charanarvinda Bhaktivedanta Swamishila Prabhupada Translation O great sage, graciously be pleased to listen to the prayer of my humble self, for my mind is troubled by affection from my daughter. Purport by Srila Prabhupada: When a disciple is perfectly in consonance with the spiritual master, having received his message and executed it perfectly and sincerely, he has a right to ask a particular favour from the spiritual master. Generally, a pure devotee of the Lord or a pure disciple of a bona fide spiritual master does not ask any favour either from the Lord or the spiritual master. But even if there is a need to ask a favour from the spiritual master, one cannot ask that favour without satisfying him fully. Swayambhuva Manu wanted to disclose his mind regarding the function he wanted to execute due to affection for his daughter. Thus ends the bhaktivedanta purport. Swayambhuva Manu is seeking the attention of Karadvama Muni to consider his prayer with regard to something that is disturbing his mind or troubled by the affection for my daughter.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "It is his free will to be pleased or not be pleased with me."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the humility required in approaching a spiritual master, emphasizing that pleasing the guru is not about earning mercy through service, but about the guru's grace and free will.

Swayambhuva Manu was concerned about getting his daughter married and obviously he had in his mind Karadvama Muni. So he is saying here, O great sage, graciously be pleased to listen to the prayer of my humble self. This is how one addresses the spiritual master even if he has to, if he has to be addressed with respect to any request. See the humility. He is not just going and asking something. He is respecting him so much. He says, graciously be pleased. I am not saying that, I qualify that you be pleased with me. Graciously be pleased. Please be graceful. If someone asks somebody, please be pleased, I want you to be pleased with me. When is somebody pleased? When there is an exchange. The guru is pleased with the disciple when he receives service from the disciple. When he receives that, he is pleased with the disciple. But the disciple is thinking, just because I did service, even if he is pleased, it is because of his grace and not because of my contribution. Even if I do service, he need not be pleased. So he says, graciously be pleased. This is the way Swami Prabhupada Manu is addressing the spiritual master, as a disciple will address a spiritual master. So everywhere, in the relationship between guru and disciple, this is a very key point, that it is not a relationship of earning mercy or earning something by doing service to the spiritual master, you earn something. That is not the relationship. That is not the mood also. I will serve my spiritual master. It is his free will to be pleased or not be pleased

**Key Quote:** "It is only by his grace it is reaching Krishna."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that a disciple's service to the spiritual master is ultimately offered to Krishna, and it is through the guru's grace that the service becomes worthy of reaching Krishna, as the disciple is unqualified to serve Krishna directly.

with me. It is his own grace upon me, if he is pleased. That attitude is there because the disciple doesn't think that he can actually, he has the quality, humility to do pure devotional service to the Lord. The spiritual master is pleased with pure devotional service, because spiritual master, he is situated in a platform of absolute purity in his relationship with Krishna. So whatever service the living entity is offering to the spiritual master, naturally, the spiritual master doesn't want any service. He offers it to Krishna. Ekala, Ishvara, Krishna, Arasava, Brijya. Only Krishna is Ishvara. So a pure devotee of the Lord is offering pure devotional service. So when the disciple is offering service to spiritual master for Krishna to please him, the disciple knows that whatever I am offering is not worthy of going to Krishna. It is only by his grace it is reaching Krishna. The disciple never thinks that I can serve the spiritual master directly. I can serve Krishna directly. I can serve my spiritual master directly but I cannot serve Krishna directly. I have no qualification to serve Krishna directly. Krishna is surrounded and served by pure devotees of the Lord. So therefore, if at all my service has to reach Krishna, it is reaching Krishna because of the spiritual master's grace upon us. Whatever is lacking from the disciple, whatever the disciple offers to Krishna, it is pure devotional service. Whatever is lacking, the spiritual master compensates it and then offers it to the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "If you are getting attached to Krishna, it is because of the mercy of the spiritual master."
**Summary:** Using an analogy of needing 100 units of humility for service to reach Krishna, the speaker illustrates how the spiritual master compensates for the disciple's deficiencies and offers the perfected service to the Lord, emphasizing the guru's immense mercy.

This is his kindness. Suppose something, a quantity of let's say 100 is required. Just to give an example, 100 units of something is required. Say 100 units of humility is required for a service to go to Krishna. And we are offering service to the spiritual master. You may have one or you may have minus one or minus two or whatever. We offer that service to the spiritual master. The spiritual master, whether it is minus one or minus 100, he will make it plus 100 and offer it to Krishna because he sees something is there. So much is the transparent via media function of the spiritual master. So merciful he is. And if we are making advancement in Krishna consciousness, it is because of the mercy of the spiritual master. If you are getting attached to Krishna, it is because of the mercy of the spiritual master. If you are getting purified, it is due to the mercy of the spiritual master. That mercy, that is what graciously, the Lord is, the spiritual master, please be graciously be pleased with me. You cannot say, be pleased with me. Graciously be pleased with me. So sensitive, because he recognizes that in terms of his absolute goal of going back to Krishna is most unqualified. So in that mood, he is praying, Swayambhu Ammanu is praying to him.

**Key Quote:** "One has to receive the message of the spiritual master regarding how to act in one's capacity for the spiritual master is expert in giving such instructions."
**Summary:** The speaker reads Srila Prabhupada's purport, emphasizing the importance of receiving instructions from a bona fide spiritual master and executing them according to one's capacity in Krishna Consciousness, highlighting the guru's role in guiding disciples towards perfection.

Previous translation: I have fortunately been instructed by you and thus great favor has been bestowed upon me. I thank God and I have listened with open ears to your pure words. Purport: Srila Rupa Goswami has given directions in his Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu on how to accept a bona fide spiritual master and how to deal with him. First, the desiring candidate must find a bona fide spiritual master and then he must very eagerly receive instructions from him and execute them. This is reciprocal service. A bona fide spiritual master, a saintly person always desires to elevate a common man who comes to him, because everyone is under the delusion of Maya and is forgetful of his prime duty, Krishna Consciousness. Saintly person always desires that everyone becomes a saintly person. It is the function of a saintly person to invoke Krishna Consciousness in every forgetful man. Manu said that he was advised and instructed by Kardama Muni he was very much favored. He considered himself lucky to receive the message, by oral reception. It is especially mentioned here that one should be very inquisitive to hear with open ears from the authorized source of a bona fide spiritual master. How is one to receive? One should receive the transcendental message by oral reception. The word Karna Randhrahey means through the holes of the ears. The favor of the spiritual master is not received through any other part of the body but the ears. This does not mean however that the spiritual master gives a particular type of mantra through the ears in exchange for some dollars and if the man meditates on that he achieves perfection and becomes God within six months. Such reception through the ears is bogus. The real fact is that a bona fide spiritual master knows the nature of a particular man and what sort of duties he can perform in Krishna Consciousness and he instructs him in that way. He instructs him through the ear not privately but publicly. You are fit for such and such a work in Krishna Consciousness you can act in this way. One person is advised to work in Krishna Consciousness by working in the deity's room another is advised to act in Krishna Consciousness by performing editorial work another is advised to do preaching work another is advised to carry out Krishna Consciousness in the cooking department. There are different departments of activities in Krishna Consciousness and the spiritual master knowing the particular ability of a particular man trains him in such a way that he becomes perfect. Bhagavad Gita makes it clear that one can attain the highest perfection in spiritual life simply by offering service according to his ability just as Arjuna served Krishna by his ability in the military art. Arjuna offered his service fully as a military man and he became perfect. Similarly an artist can attain perfection simply by performing artistic work on the direction of the spiritual master. If one is a literary man he can write articles and poetry for the service of God under the direction of the spiritual master. One has to receive the message of the spiritual master regarding how to act in one's capacity for the spiritual master is expert in giving

The faithful execution of the instruction which he receives from the spiritual master is the only duty of a disciple and that will bring him perfection.

**Summary:** A devotee shares a commentary and a question, reminiscing about the time of Srila Prabhupada's physical presence and the strong faith and conviction that disciples had in serving him, even without direct personal access, and how they trusted the process of devotional service.

So, we were discussing last time. Anybody has any question of this? Ah, yes. Thank you so much Madhupandi Prabhu. It's a little commentary and then a question that I remember in your class you mentioned something very vital which was how in the time of the physical presence in the planet of his divine grace everybody knew that we could not be having the natural access, thousands of us there, and we were respecting the chain of authority in a natural way. Nobody was questioning at all and everyone felt the service toward Srila Prabhupada. And then the element was such conviction that this chain ended in Srila Prabhupada that every one of us very willingly renounced this need that came as a little child needs to be with the father personally. So, that was his mercy through his service for his mission. And one other element that was struck in my remembrance when you mentioned these things was that we knew that taking time of his service, his service was so valuable, he already asked us to leave him out of the management of our aspirations to do something. But there was one element that solved or at least for several of us that impediment, let's call it, or distance, it was that we could write Srila Prabhupada any moment but we knew also that there were hundreds of letters every day. In my memory I can still continue writing but never delivered it. These letters were accumulated and were checked by our own in the course of time because we were consider about his time for the service and then in due course of time we could see the letters being answered through the process of devotional service. And it's a very good practice even I regret I cannot do it now but I do in another way but it's very scientific and practical not having envy but most of them became too familiar. So this process is so powerful having the right faith in the process itself

that the presence of Srila Prabhupada is not only right now in front of me and you is also there or in the altar and everywhere not because again he is God but because he is a spiritual master I mean the liberated soul the intimate associate of the Lord can expand unlimitedly the difference with the Lord is that he cannot create any universe or anything but that power is with the spiritual master we need to have that faith only but also we need to have the spiritual master who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one are the physical I mean our soul has so much energy that ray we have to breathe up in that soul that is our soul we should 카 softly I cannot know it is This process, obviously, you know, at least grossly, did not happen even during Srila Prabhupada's preaching time in this planet. It did not happen. Grossly, it did not happen.

**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa explains that although Srila Prabhupada may not directly instruct every disciple, the system he established, with its management structure and association of devotees, is designed to fulfill the function of guiding disciples in Krishna consciousness.

Just like today also, that is not grossly happening. We are all disciples of Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada is not directly telling us, this is your quality, now this is what, this is the service you should do. He is not. Neither he did that during his time, nor now. Yet Srila Prabhupada is writing in the purport that this is a process. What does that mean? Some other way this is happening. Some other way this is happening. In other, which is the way it is happening, it is not very difficult to understand. Srila Prabhupada set up an institute, a mechanism of association of sadhus, devotees, who are all his disciples, who are all his followers. And within that he established a management structure, a way of receiving service, a way of associating and a way of progress in Krishna consciousness, which he amply demonstrated during his presence on this planet by writing so many letters, do like this, do like that, this, that, there are so many things. Including, why you are writing to me, all these questions you should ask your GBC. That also he has asked. Including sometimes he will say, why this, don't ask silly questions. That also he has asked. So, all kinds of answers he has given, very practical way he has given those. So, we are guided by the mechanism set up by him. Now, Srila Prabhupada is a pure devotee. He is an empowered representative of the Lord. If he has set up a system, that system, if it is properly followed, it will fulfill this function, 100%.

Otherwise how Lord Chaitanya's mercy will spread to thousands and thousands of people, because you can find out that to have a pure devotee as a spiritual master itself is so rare. We have seen that. So many people try to become the, you know, sit in the temple. So many people try to become the, you know, sit in the temple. They are in the chain of discipline succession, replacing, trying to replace Prabhupada. And what happened? So, it is very clear that Srila Prabhupada is going to be the spiritual master for millions of living entities. How will Prabhupada do this function for millions of living entities? He can do it. He will do it. He is doing it. Even now he is doing it. This faith is required, because this process that... spiritual, just like Prabhupada said, my spiritual master is, I never, what is it, he is always with me. That is understanding. So in the same way, one should have faith that Prabhupada is always with me. Don't doubt that. He is always with every disciple. He is always with every disciple to guide, assist the devotee, to engage him in devotional service. That is the position of an acharya. How can Srila Prabhupada do that for millions? Yes, he is all-pervading. Just like Krishna is all-pervading for his service, Prabhupada is all-pervading. Therefore, he is always with the disciple. One should have faith in this principle that

**Key Quote:** "So the authority system that is there, which is properly situated, is non-different from Srila Prabhupada directly giving."
**Summary:** The lecture explains that the authority system established by Srila Prabhupada is non-different from his direct instructions, and one should have faith in the process, even if there are imperfections in the individuals within the system.

such principles are working among the devotee community. That is why progress is happening. So instead of Prabhupada directs, directly telling, this is your nature, this is the service you have to do, through the authority system it is happening. So the authority system that is there, which is properly situated, is non-different from Srila Prabhupada directly giving. At the same time, you cannot also, this also I explained last time, simultaneously one and different. Prabhupada directly giving and through institution it is, when he gave directly to few disciples, he gave directly to few disciples. That is what I am saying. That is what I am saying. That is what I am telling you. There is a difference. Definitely, that is very fortunate. There is a small difference of directly. When there is directly given then there is no question of any abuse. And it is, through the system, it is not one hundred percent, in the sense it could be one per here, it could be one. It could be same as, as as Prabhupada himself is directly telling It could be when Prabhupada is directly telling somebody it's only that. But when through the institution mechanism it is coming, it is meant to be same. But if there is an abuse of the system, then there is a problem. But for that I explained last time, that one should have faith in the person, in the process. If he has a faith in the process, it does not matter what is the purity or what is the level of, what is the Krishna conscious level of the person from whom you are receiving, as long as he is in that chain of system. Whatever it is, one should simply execute the instructions. One should not materially calculate all these things.

**Key Quote:** "The spirit of perfectness is what we are practicing here."
**Summary:** The speaker advises against getting caught up in material calculations and striving for material perfection in devotional service, emphasizing the importance of living in the present moment and serving the Lord to the best of one's ability with a good spirit.

We are practicing. We are practicing bhakti. One should not think that, okay, now, see, I have been asked to go to, I have, you know, I have been asked to go to somewhere, to go to Vrindavan by, you know, my authority told me to go by Indian Airlines or Air India flight. Then I went and checked, I found out it was, okay, I went and came back also. I did my job. Afterwards I found out that Indigo, you know, was, you know, 100 rupees cheaper. How my authority gave me this instruction? We lost 100 rupees for Krishna. All these material calculation you should not see. It will happen. Everybody is, you know, there is perfect, materially perfectness, perfectness is different. The spirit of perfectness is what we are practicing here. So many things we are doing, devotional service in this material, in this, don't get into that material perfection. The way we run this temple, 10 years back was different, today, much improved materially. 10 years back, how we run this temple, if you see, you will see, hey, hey, hey, really, it was so silly. You are doing this mistake. Now we are done. 10 more years from now, you will see it will be materially much more perfect. So some devotees get into this material rightness and wrongness. That is not what we are practicing. We are practicing here, live in the present, whatever maturity you have in good spirit, best of your ability, you serve the Lord, and then go on.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The principle of Guru is coming from all directions"
**Summary:** The lecture emphasizes that taking one's assigned duty as given by Krishna and executing it is the same as Arjuna receiving instruction from Krishna, and that the principle of Gurutva, or the essence of the guru's teachings, can be learned from various sources, including karmis and new bhaktas.

So that is, that spirit of receiving the service and executing the service as an instruction from the spiritual master, why in Prabhupada's purport, in Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, now Prabhupada goes one level up. He says, Oh, you may say that Krishna was before Arjuna, so he could give him instruction directly. How is it that I am, you know, but we don't have Krishna before us to follow his instruction? So Prabhupada says, no, if one simply takes his assigned duty, as given by Krishna and executed, it is the same as Arjuna. As Arjuna received instruction from Krishna so it's a very mystical process you cannot go by this gross bodily arrangement and feel completely confused we are in a spiritual life, it's a spiritual process Prabhupada is not physically limited for the sake of being worshipped he is in a deity form so that we can offer dress we can offer flowers, we can offer arati we can pray grossly, obeisances therefore he is there doesn't mean he is only there he is everywhere for the disciple he is always with him to help the disciple and he works through, his help comes through so many so many medium it comes through the principle of Guru is coming from all directions we learn something from Karmis also some Karmis say something that principle Gurutva you have faith in your spiritual master that Gurutva you can pick up from anywhere the Lord Paramatma is everywhere and he teaches the disciple from every source he will from your God brothers you will learn from a new Bhakta you will learn sometimes from a Karmis whom you are going and preaching Krishna consciousness suddenly you will see that he will give the answer for something that you had a big question about so

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of having faith in following Srila Prabhupada and avoiding "analysis paralysis" by overanalyzing every detail, using the analogy of choosing a phone in an electronic shop to illustrate how too many choices can freeze one's free will.

this process is working and I will progress in spiritual life if I have faith in the faith to follow Srila Prabhupada and I also last time talked about this going very sharply what exactly I should do now that parallel don't get into that paralysis mental paralysis in fact even normally speaking also let us say you go to a shop electronic shop you want to buy one phone you go to a big showroom you will see about hundred models isn't that? hundred possibilities are there as a Jeeva your ability to exercise your free will is also limited in other words your free will can get paralyzed is it not? if you buy one you will think oh okay you bought one oh then you will say oh I should have bought that one or you choose that one then you should have bought that one that was there this is the way it is in other words the more the choices we have the more our free will will get frozen isn't it? we are tiny living entities we have limited free will we are guided by the you know processes if you go into analyzing too much what I should do today what I should do now what I should do tomorrow every tiny detail I should know somebody should tell me then only I am 100% surrendered to Krishna then I should do this I know that whatever I am doing is what Krishna is saying, Krishna wants me to do. If Krishna is going to tell you every moment what you should do, raise your right hand, you know, left hand, it's ridiculous, isn't it? It doesn't work like that. That's why I call that as analysis paralysis.

**Key Quote:** "Either the institution system should be there or guru system should be there."
**Summary:** A devotee adds to the discussion, and the speaker explains how any attempt to short-circuit the process given by Prabhupada will be ejected by the system, using examples of conflicts between gurus and temple management, and emphasizing that the current system is the Prabhupada Acharya system, not the rithvik system.

Yeah. Hare Krishna Prabhu, just to add on to what you already said. Even today in the opposite camp, the gurus are separate and the management is separate. I mean, they don't get into the management and all those things is what I heard. So even there also, they're not getting directly from their own gurus any instruction to do service or what? Correct. See, what has happened, what is happening is, anybody who tries to short circuit the process given by Prabhupada, invariably the system will eject. That is what is happening, because Prabhupada and Krishna is so intelligent that you just cannot, you know, for some time you may play, but you will see that there is a problem in institution, immediately GBC will meet together and they will say, this is a problem. I think in the temple hall, guru puja is a problem. One resolution, no guru pujas in the temple or they will say, okay, here, there is a problem that this, the temple president is telling this and the guru comes in, visit the temple and the temple president says, you know, this devotee is not doing, you know, pujari service that pujari, that pujari will say, Prabhu, I will ask my guru, this is happening in other temples. I'll ask my guru. Whatever my guru says, I will do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And the guru, it depends. I mean, the guru, if he's a very important disciple, he gave a lot of gurudakshina and things like that. Then he's thinking, how I can displease him? He wants a change of service. So he'll call temple president. He'll say, please give him change of service. Then he'll say, no Maharaj, how can I do, you know, I know that pujari is, no, no, no, you do it. Or he's little hesitant, when he is little hesitant, the disciple will go outside and say to all his godbrothers, he will say, see, temple president does not respect our guru. Then there is whole politics there. All of them gang up against the temple president. So GBC discussed all these things. Yes, it is a fact. Let us make a resolution. The resolution is gurus have no authority to instruct their disciples regarding their service. Resolution. Eject. Out of the system, eject. Either the institution system should be there or guru system should be there. When Prabhupada was there, both were one. Guru system and institution was one. So that like this kind of resolution, they end up in making all these things. So even. See, they are unwillingly following the rithvik system. The other is gone, is unwillingly following the rithvik system. Forced to follow the rithvik system. If you ask someone of their gurus, you ask them, you know what, Madhupandi, I'm actually a rithvik only, the guru says. Then somebody else will say, no, why don't you just come together? You know. See, practically we are, you know, everything is a rithvik system. When we are happily following, why we should come and, you know, follow in, you know, in a hidden manner, rithvik system. Prabhupada has very blessed us and we are very fortunate, we have a wonderful, open, freely following Prabhupada Acharya system. In fact, we shouldn't even call this system rithvik system. That doesn't work. They are the one who gave that name. This is not the rithvik system. Just like Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, Prabhupada Acharya system it is. Any time in future somebody says, you know, you're following rithvik system, no, no, we are following Prabhupada Acharya system. We are from the Acharya Sampradaya. Prabhupada Acharya system. We are from the Acharya Sampradaya system.

**Key Quote:** "Sukha Dukha, material Sukha Dukha for the body and the mind, is fixed for everybody when one takes birth."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Sukha and Dukha (happiness and distress) are fixed at birth, but not in a way that eliminates free will.

The forces of the mind and the body and the senses that rise up. How we manage those things? We are given guidelines by Krishna and Bhagavad Gita, by our Acharya, by the Purvacharyas. How you conduct your life in a manner in which you handle these urges? We handle these natural, bodily, mental urges. We cannot deny that these urges are not there. Nobody can deny. We have taken this body in this material world for enjoying, so therefore the Lord has mercifully given this body, just like every karma He gives, He gives us a body according to our karma. This body has got a certain value. It has got a certain potential of Sukha and Dukha, which is unveiled, it's a function of time. Tomorrow on Sukha Dukha, day after tomorrow on Sukha Dukha, next year, 100 years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now, it's a function of Kala, Sukha Dukha. But Prabhupada says and the Shastra says that Sukha Dukha is a function of time. It's a function of time. It's a function of time. So Sukha Dukha, material Sukha Dukha for the body and the mind, is fixed for everybody when one takes birth. It is fixed. Sukha and Dukha is an experience. So Sukha Dukha is fixed. Not that this particular Sukha is fixed, this particular Dukha is fixed. Not that the full chart of where all you will get Sukha, where all you will get Dukha is fixed. That is not what it means. That is not what it means.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how devotees can manage pleasure and pain by using their 'currency' in Krishna's service, burning off 'Dukkha currency' through austerities.

What the devotee does is what? He uses that currency for Krishna's service. The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat and cold, misery and happiness. A Krishna conscious person is above duality because he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of Krishna. Just see, when you take trouble to serve Prabhupada and Krishna, bodily, mental struggle you take against your wish. Tapasya means against your default mode. Now your present wish is to serve Prabhupada and Krishna. But there is a default mode, lazy fellow, all these kind of things, don't want to do, live happily. All this kind of philosophy, you know, concocted, karmi philosophy will be there. If the devotee is having the, you know, has determined to work hard for Prabhupada, take trouble for Prabhupada, sweat for Prabhupada, take tension for Prabhupada, take anxiety for Prabhupada, please understand that you are burning your Dukkha currency. If you don't take trouble for Prabhupada. If you don't take trouble for Prabhupada. If you don't take trouble for Prabhupada. If you don't take tension for Prabhupada, if you don't take anxiety for Prabhupada, Dukkha will come to you some other way, which is not service of Krishna. It may even stop service of Krishna, right? If you become very sick, then you will not be able to even do service, isn't it? Now I am talking about how devotees manage pleasure and pain. In Kota, which is there as per law of karma, management of pleasure and pain.

**Key Quote:** "So secret number one is, take authorized austerities."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of taking authorized austerities in Krishna consciousness to avoid struggling for material existence.

So secret number one is, take authorized austerities. One of the things that disturb ones most in life, for everybody is what? When problems come. Isn't it? Nobody likes problems. So better we take voluntarily problems. In this material world, to preach Krishna consciousness is very problematic. To raise funds is very problematic. To convince somebody is very problematic. You need patience, tolerance, be behind him, be behind him, be behind him. Be behind him. You have to put chest. To make one devotee, right? Or you take up a project, you have to be behind it. Every problems that the karmas have in building a project, the devotee will also have to face. So all these things when we do for Krishna, it has got very high value to make our devotional life peaceful. Therefore austerity should be taken. So many times in different classes I have told, in Krishna consciousness after you have come, if you don't struggle for your spiritual, for service, if you don't struggle to control your senses, then you will be made to struggle for material existence. Struggle will not be, that struggle will not be taken away. When you struggle for material existence, it is useless. It doesn't help you in any way. It's all temporary. When you struggle for Krishna consciousness, it is giving you eternal benefit. So, where do you, suppose you say, anyway you have to struggle. If you struggle here, you will get something for this life. If you struggle here, you will get something eternal for your soul. Which will you choose? This is intelligent management. Therefore, we should struggle.

Maybe you don't want to be in one shot and finish your 16 rounds. After few rounds your mind will say something else. No. Take austerity. Do it. Finish it. There are hundreds of ways in which in our personal life, in devotees personal life, in Krishna consciousness movement that Prabhupada has given, there are hundreds of ways of picking up austerities, bona fide austerity.

Today, you know, I will, after morning program, you know, suddenly you will see one brahmachari in the middle of the brahmachari ashram, standing on one leg. Prabhupada, today I have decided, 10 hours I am going to stand like this. Why? No, tapasya. So that I can burn off my, you know, papa bijas. No, tapasya. So that I can burn off my, you know, papa bijas. No, tapasya. So that I can burn off my, you know, papa bijas. No, we are talking about tapasya which will give us eternal benefit. Oh, I have to do tapasya Prabhu, you told me. No, Mondays I will fast and Fridays I will fast. No. These are all good for karmas. Yes, it helps them, encourages them. Every kind of austerity. Austerity for pleasing Shiva, austerity for pleasing Ganesha. Monday for Shiva I will fast. Thursday I will fast for Ganesha. Monday for Shiva I will fast. Thursday I will fast for Ganesha. Thursday I will fast for Ganesha. All this they have. Let them do. But we want to do those austerities which are pleasing to Vishnu, to the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that even within bona fide austerities, there are specific guidelines given by the spiritual master, using the example of visiting Radha Kunda.

So we have to be very careful in simply, that is another extreme. Some devotees go into this whole austerity mode and all this kind of things. So there are bona fide austerities. So there are bona fide austerities. Within even those bona fide austerities, Srila Prabhupada has given us, even within these bona fide austerities, again a set of austerities. Why he has given a set of austerities? Just suppose somebody says, oh I want to go to Radha Kunda and chant every day 64 rounds. See, it is a, how can you say no, it is not a good austerity. Now you have to again see what our bona fide, our spiritual master has told us. Now you have to again see what our bona fide, our spiritual master has told us. Stand 16 rounds nicely, probably another 10 lives. Then one day you will go to Radha Kunda. There is a stage for everything. Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur used to blast any disciple if he goes to Radha Kunda and sits. He said, you are not qualified even to dip in Radha Kunda. He said, you are not qualified even to dip in Radha Kunda. He said, you are not qualified even to dip in Radha Kunda. Even Prabhupada, I think only once or something he went dip, but afterwards he stopped. Because all the foreign disciples started swimming and everything in Radha Kunda.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights that hearing the holy name of the Lord is the greatest tapasya in this age, despite being easier than other forms of austerity.

In fact, the greatest tapasya that one can do in this age is to hear the holy name of the Lord. See, tapasya can be known, can be understood by two means. One is how difficult it is. Another is what is the result of it. See, don't mistake, always tapasya means pain. It's not so. There are authorized tapasyas. Each tapasya has a pain and a result. If you take chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra, the hearing of Hare Krishna Mahamantra, definitely is not so difficult as standing on one leg for 10 hours. Right? Much easier. But the result of that one hearing of Hare Krishna cannot be compared to 100 years of standing on one leg. So that's what you have to understand.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the need for an Acharya's guidance to properly understand the scriptures and apply them to one's life.

Don't think that tapasya only means, you know, tapasya means authorized tapasas. Authorized tapasas, authorized austerity, because there is some, definitely some tapas is there in hearing because mind goes here and there. But it is not, it is, it is, it is easy, easier than many other tapasyas. But the value of this tapasya is something which is, what is revealed in the scriptures. Discounted tapasya for Kali Yuga. Just simply you hear then you get, you know, the results of so many Ashwamedha Yajna, Shastras. Even then you cannot equal to this tapasya of hearing this Hare Krishna Mahamantra. So, we have to be very careful in understanding purport of Prabhupada, understanding these verses. That is why an Acharya's guidance is required. Otherwise you will misunderstand. Otherwise from Bhagavatam, whatever you want, you can get. All kinds of stories are there. Whatever you want to justify, you will get it. Sometimes devotees, sometimes devotees also argue, no, no, actually Bhagavatam is for Grahasthas. And the Paramahamsas say, no, no, Bhagavatam is a Paramahamsa Shastra. It is for Paramahamsas. The fact is that for those who want to practice Vaishnavism, it is available for everybody, irrespective of any Ashrama. Bhagavatam caters to Grahasthas. Bhagavatam caters to Paramahamsas also. So such an all-encompassing literature is Srimad Bhagavatam. Therefore we need guidance. How it is applicable to each. And that is how I explain now.

What about Sukha? That also is there in the purse everyday. It is delivered in the plate, Sukha and Dukha, everyday. Just like Dukha comes without asking, Sukha also comes without asking. Now again, don't think that Sukha means that specific Sukha. Then you have no free will. No. Suppose a specific Sukha is pushed upon you, then you have no free will at all. So there is a Sukha. Now whether you want to, what do you want to do with this Sukha? This is another very important clue, how to manage our pleasure and pain. Now pain management, I have told. Pleasure management, I will tell. How pleasure management? You can decide what to take pleasure in, you have got a free will. Just like you have got pleasure currency, either you can buy it, you know, tomatoes or orange or apple or what you want to buy, you can buy. Currency is fixed and you have to spend it by evening. It's a force on the body. It's a Vega in the body. Pleasure Vega is coming in the body, in the mind. Pleasure Vega is coming. You have to spend it. And I told you, to spend it, you can decide what to take pleasure in. What is it? You have got the freedom to decide what to take pleasure in. But pleasure you have to take everyday. What to take pleasure in? It's a very big freedom. It's a very big knowledge item. That you have got a freedom to choose what to take this pleasure in.

**Summary:** The speaker advises devotees to take pleasure in chanting, devotional service, and all work done for Krishna to manage their pleasure quota.

So what should we take pleasure in? Chanting, devotion service, dancing, taking prashadam. Take pleasure in every work that you do for Prabhupada and Krishna. Everyday your pleasure management of your body-mind system is taken care of. But you have to take pleasure. That is very important. All of you can research. Go into Prabhupada folio and see. Taking pleasure. About 300 times Prabhupada has written. Taking pleasure. That means it is your free will. You should take pleasure in Brahmanical life. You should take pleasure in sadhana. You should take pleasure in your work. See somebody is, let us say, the person is thinking, oh this is very, you know, I have to work, I have to work, I have to work, I have to work. Then he is not, that days all pleasure currency is piling up. By evening, by night he is frustrated. Because his pleasure currency is not burnt. And finally that pleasure currency will come out of some gross sense enjoyment. Very important. Somewhere it has to go, sensual pleasure it will come out. Those who enjoy their service, whatever it may be, even if it is difficult work, take pleasure. Do you know the secret that you can take pleasure in things which are painful also?

These are all big tricks of the mind. You can take pleasure in a painful thing. Painful for the body, painful for the mind, but pleasure for the soul. So you can take pleasure, just like tapasya also you can take pleasure. So taking pleasure in chanting, taking pleasure in everything that you do, taking pleasure in the service, because nearly 8-10 hours, 7-8 hours you are spending in service. So the mood in which you do service is very important for you to control your senses. You have to learn how to enjoy your service. Enjoy means not that, enjoy means not enjoy the content of the service. Enjoy doing service. You have to take pleasure in doing service to Krishna. I like it. This way day to day we can manage the pleasure and pain quota.

**Key Quote:** "At the same time we don't get bound by karma. In the same time, if we are freed from sinful expressions of pain and pleasure."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses managing pleasure and pain to avoid karma, emphasizing bona fide expressions of pleasure in Krishna consciousness.

At the same time we don't get bound by karma. In the same time, if we are freed from sinful expressions of pain and pleasure. There are bona fide expressions of pain and pleasure. Taking prasadam is bona fide pleasure, expression of pleasure. Right? Eating nonsense, it is not a bona fide pleasure. So there are bona fide expressions of pleasure and pain, pleasure and pain in our Krishna consciousness life, that Prabhupada has given us. And you take pleasure and do it. Take pleasure in honoring prasadam. Take pleasure in kirtan. Somebody may say, no, take pleasure is all artificial. How can I take pleasure? It should become pleasurable. Anything before it becomes pleasurable, you have to take pleasure. This is another rule. Because pleasure is a combination of something from outside and your decision to enjoy. Your pleasure potency. Each of us have a tiny pleasure potency. We are sample of God. If you don't decide to take pleasure, even outside thing if it is pleasurable also, you will not feel pleasure. Both have to mix together.

**Key Quote:** "Because pleasure is a combination of something from outside and your decision to enjoy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that pleasure is a combination of external stimuli and the individual's decision to enjoy, highlighting the role of free will.

Hydrogen is gas. Oxygen is gas. Mix hydrogen and oxygen, you get something which is water, liquid. The property of water is neither of hydrogen or oxygen. Yes? In the same way, if you take my contribution of giving pleasure potency is hydrogen. Sense object is oxygen. Only when they mix together, you get what is sense gratification. Sense gratification is a combination of sense enjoyer and sense object. Is it not? So therefore, you have trained yourself, you have conditioned yourself to enjoy something. It simply means that you have already taught your mind to take pleasure in it. That is why now, you are not consciously taking pleasure. But you have trained your mind to take pleasure in it. It is already set inside. If you have not taken pleasure in it, you will not find, you will not, you know, you have to teach yourself fresh how to enjoy. Every enjoyment is not automatic. Every enjoyment that we have with the sense object, it is all learnt. From childhood slowly it is learnt. This is pleasurable. Okay, I will take pleasure in it. You see such a big role, this taking pleasure, free will to take pleasure. In the actual final pleasure experience, your taking pleasure is such an important factor.

**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of managing pleasure and pain through authorized means in Krishna consciousness to achieve a peaceful mind.

So we have to take pleasure in bona fide expressions of pleasure, which are many in Krishna consciousness movement, authorized for us as a Brahmachari, as a Grihastha, whatever, it is plenty. So this way, if we manage our expressions of pleasure and pain, Kota, which is in our destiny, as long as we have this body, that force is there. So as long as, if we can manage that in this, using these two formulas, then our mind will be peaceful. Mind cannot become sober, when there is pain and pleasure, these two things pull the mind apart, these dualities. You cannot be a sober person, you cannot be a dheera, dheera means sober, adheera means pleasure pulls, pain pulls, your consciousness, pleasure and pain may be there, but your consciousness is pulled up and down. So a dheera is one whose consciousness is not pulled up and down. So that your consciousness is not pulled up and down, you have to minimize the pull of pleasure and pain, by management of your pleasure and pain, Kota. So that the mind is peaceful, and it can execute positive devotional service.

**Summary:** In a Q&A, the speaker explains how chanting nicely manages pleasure and pain by combining the soul's pleasure with the body and mind's austerity.

Hare Krishna. Any questions? Yes. Hare Krishna. When we do our chanting very nicely, by taking lot of tapasya, this pleasure and dukkha, whatever we have, get managed throughout the day, mystically or in a very automatic way? Yes, it manages, because two things you are already doing, taking pleasure in chanting, and while taking pleasure in chanting, while you are taking pleasure in chanting, you are doing austerity with your mind and body, which doesn't take pleasure. It wants freedom. You tell sit in one place and chant, it doesn't want. Mind and body is, by default goes in another direction. So you learn how to take pleasure, with your soul, and you are taking pain with your body and mind, lot of your Kota is burnt out. Whole day you can remain a Dheera.

But if you do what a pure devotee has told, on a day to day basis we can be a Dheera. Today you can be a Dheera, if you have done this chanting nicely. Tomorrow if you don't do chanting, you will be a Dheera. Whereas a pure devotee, who is fixed in Krishna consciousness, he is always Dheera.

You've got a free will to take pleasure in pain of body and mind. Understand? Yeah.

#### Krishna consciousness, Nature of the soul, Love for Krishna

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna is the supreme proprietor of everything in existence, being the cause of all causes, he is in eternal control of everything in existence."
**Summary:** This segment introduces Krishna as the supreme cause of all existence, emphasizes the concept of Krishna consciousness, and explains the relationship between Krishna and individual souls as part and parcel, highlighting the forgotten love for Krishna.

So today we will talk about the glories of the holy name of the Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna, the Sarvakarnakara, means the cause of all causes. He is the supreme original cause of the entire existence. He is working as per the scheme of the Supreme Lord, Lord Krishna. The purpose of material existence is Him. Everything, including us, this material energy, everything that we see here and beyond matter, the Vaikunthaloka, everything is emanating from Him as the supreme cause. So this is this consciousness that Krishna, everything is Krishna and or His energies, display of His energies, is what is the consciousness called Krishna consciousness. We are also tiny persons, part and parcel of God. As tiny persons, all the characteristics of a tiny person, if you study that, he can think, he can feel, he can will, he can have ego, he can enjoy, he can live, he can have ego, he can enjoy, he can love, he can possess. If you take all these characteristics, just like a drop of ocean is salty as much as the quality of the entire ocean is, quality quantity is less, in the same way, we are able to see that in this body there is a soul, there is a person who is having all these personhood features, and the body does not have these personhood features. This body does not have thinking, feeling, willing, egoing, does not have this. It's all coming from the resident of this body. Body is a dead matter. The body is no different from any machine, but in illusion we think we are the body. So Krishna, the supreme lord, is also a person, person of, we are persons of tiny consciousness, he is a person of infinite consciousness. We are persons of different limited control of limited energies around us, like this body and bodily control over things outside the body, and this control is only temporary. If you extend that characteristic to Krishna, Krishna is the supreme proprietor of everything in existence, being the cause of all causes, he is in eternal control of everything in existence. Unlike us, we are in control of things according to karma, little control. Today somebody is rich, today someone will be poor, tomorrow someone will possess something, today tomorrow he will lose that possession. But Krishna is the eternal possessor of all existence, being the supreme lord. We have to think about all these things which the shastras describe, the characteristic of Bhagavan, and we have to contemplate on this, what is the vedic conception of Krishna, because the absolute sense, if you get the right conception of Krishna, that is Krishna. Krishna and his conception, absolute conception as received from guru, sadhu and shastra, are not different from Krishna himself. So as a prelude to speaking about Krishna's name, I have given introduction to Krishna's personality. Krishna, the supreme absolute person, cause of all causes, the supreme persons, person of all the small persons, and what is our relationship with that supreme person, that we are his part and parcel. We are his, we have forgotten, we eternally belong to him. We have forgotten our love for Krishna. Krishna never forgets his love for any of his part and parcel. Krishna's love is unconditional. So therefore, he seated in our heart even in our journey into this material world. Now the most important thing to understand the difference between Krishna and us, which will give us good realization of the holy name, is that Krishna, Krishna, Krishna and his energies and his energies for him are completely one, are completely one, because everything is coming from him, everything is a manifestation of his, his energy is his activity. If you say this material energy is Krishna's, it means it is an expansion of his activity, he created it, he originated it. So anything we began talking that Krishna is a cause of all causes, is a cause of all causes, therefore if we vibrate his name, his name because Krishna, because Krishna everything is Krishna's energy, if we vibrate his name with devotion, with devotion, then that is nothing but an extension of Krishna from the spiritual world. For Krishna there is no limitation of time, space and substance. Only one law governs Krishna, only one law governs Krishna, love. By love we can, by love we can endear ourselves to Krishna and this is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teaching

**Summary:** This segment discusses Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's role in bringing the Hare Krishna mantra to the world and emphasizes that the mantra's vibration continues through the disciplic succession.

and how and and on the premise the absolute truth that we all have love of Krishna but it is covered now by this material energy so Krishna in order to give an opportunity to the conditioned souls to awaken their love for Krishna to awaken their love towards their complete whole we are part and he is a whole to give an opportunity for that Krishna himself comes years back as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and He gives, He brings forth from the spiritual world this vibration, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has brought forth this vibration and this vibration is continuing through disciplic succession even to this date. The very same vibration that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu brought down. Vibration of the Lord is non-different from the Lord. Name of the Lord is non-different from the Lord. So that vibration, as I explained, beyond time, space and substance. Beyond time, that vibration that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu vibrated because beyond time, the Acharyas in our parampara, when they vibrate the name, it is the very same name that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu brought down from the spiritual world, Shuddhanama.

**Key Quote:** "Shuddhanama infuses invests all He's energies into the vibration that we generate with our tongue and that energies are satt Chaitananda energies."
**Summary:** This segment explains the concepts of Shuddhanama (pure name) and Shakti Avesha Nama (empowered name), explaining how the pure name infuses energy into the sound we chant and purifies our hearts.

And that Shuddhanama, one can get, not directly. That Shuddhanama which is coming in parampara, first acts upon us. That Shuddhanama which is coming in parampara, first acts upon us, by sending, by descending His Satchidananda Shakti effulgence into the sound that we chant. The sound that we utter is called Shakti Avesha Nama, because Shuddhanama cannot be chanted with the material tongue. Because Shuddhanama cannot be chanted with the material tongue. So Shuddhanama infuses, invests all He's energies into the vibration that we generate with our tongue and that energies are Sat, Chaitananda energies. And therefore, Nama worship. Rama worship. Nama worship means you are worshipping Shuddha Nama only. But in the beginning you worship Shuddha Nama from a distance by worshipping Shakti Avaishanama. By worshipping Shakti Avaishanama, you get association of the Shakti Avaishanama. When you get the association of Shakti Avaishanama, you get purified. Satya energy, Chitya energy, Ananda energies are energies that will purify our heart. So why Japa, the spiritual master, gives us the holy name in the form of the Shakti Avaishanama to start with. And when you are qualified, what it means? Qualified means, you awaken your spiritual tongue and your spiritual mind. The spiritual master will reveal Prema Nama, Shuddha Nama, which will give us Krishna Prema.

#### Nama Avatara, Attention, Purification

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "When our attention touches that sound, our attention becomes purified."
**Summary:** This segment describes the Hare Krishna mantra as the Nama Avatara (sound incarnation) in Kali Yuga, emphasizing the importance of attentive hearing to purify one's consciousness.

So therefore, a Sadhaka has to very seriously worship the Nama Avatara, the sound incarnation of the Lord. And in Kali Yuga, this particular name Nama Avatara is in the form of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. And we all are aware that this is proved by the fact that today this Nama Avatara He is... He is giving out the mercy, has already given out the mercy all over the world to souls from different religion, different countries, everywhere. They all have received this Nama spread all over the world in this particular form. It's Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. So, this Nama Avatara is like one sun, Surya of Satchidananda. Just like one sun reflects on so many water bodies on this earth, but the sun is one. In the same way, one Nama Prabhu is reflecting on millions of tongues who vibrate and infuses Satya, Chitta and Ananda energies into that sound. So that, that sound when we hear, consciously when we hear, when our attention touches that sound, our attention becomes purified. Right now, our attention is influenced by Raja Guna, Tama Guna and Satya Guna. When we say we are influenced by three gunas, what does it mean? It means my attention is influenced by these three gunas. Therefore, this attention needs to be purified. This attention touches the Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. You have to electrify the attention. Satchidananda eyes the attention. And how can you do that? By constant attention touch of the sound incarnation of the Lord.

#### Attentive Chanting, Offering Thoughts, Worship of Vibration

**Key Quote:** "Simply offer that problem to the fire of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare."
**Summary:** This segment provides practical advice on how to chant attentively, suggesting to offer distracting thoughts to the holy name and emphasizing that chanting and hearing are forms of worship.

This is a secret. That's all, as simple as that. How long you keep the attention touch? How continuously you keep the attention touch? How steadily you keep the attention touch? How undiluted from any other task you keep the attention touch? That much rapid, immediate progress is made by association of the Holy Name. One of the reasons why we see very slow effect on our consciousness when we chant Hare Krishna, is because our consciousness does not touch the Holy Name. Consciousness touches, our consciousness touches through attentive hearing. So, the ocean of Satchidananda, Surya of Satchidananda, non-different from Krishna, Krishna himself has taken avatar to save us from this material world, by giving us association. And we will be absolutely foolish, if we do not take this avatar that appears on our tongue, into our heart, through the process of attentive hearing. How you start with chanting one mantra, then you chant the next mantra, then you chant the next mantra, and if your attention is going away to some other thinking, then you are calling the Holy Name of the Lord in vain. In vain means you are not utilizing the purpose for which the Lord has appeared. The Lord has come down as the Surya of Satchidananda. Everything that we try in this material world, even as karmas or when our mind is attempting to do so many things during japa, it is all about chasing Satchita and Ananda. All activities are about that. So if you have faith that this Holy Name is the reservoir of all Satchitananda, then any thought that comes to disturb, you should simply, just like ghee is offered in the fire, offer it into the vibration and don't continue thinking about it. Thoughts will come, problems will come, you think about the problems during japa. Simply offer that problem to the fire of Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Because this fire is Yajna, this Nama is Krishna, this vibration is Krishna. Into the fire, into this Yajna, Purusha, Yuga Sankirtana. At that time, at the time of japa, we should completely absorb in worshipping this vibration and the way to worship this vibration, not by folding hands. If you see the form of the Lord, fold hands. Worship means something with the body we do, pay obeisances, worship. How do you worship the vibration? With which part of the body? Tongue, and ears, and mind.

**Key Quote:** "When you are chanting Hare Krishna, Krishna is dancing on your tongue."
**Summary:** This segment explains how to worship the Nama Avatara through chanting and hearing, emphasizing the importance of faith and the gradual process of realization.

So it's a very simple worship. Just like you offer worship to Krishna's form, with your hand, you take agarbatti and you offer. Same way, very simple. Use your tongue, chant, and then hear the holy name. You are worshipping Nama Avatara. Anybody who becomes a worshipper of Nama Avatara, becomes a devotee of Nama Avatara, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, his life is done. One should not think that I am mechanically doing 16 rounds every day. You should think, two hours I am sitting to worship the Lord in His vibrational form. And there is no difference between this vibrational form and the deity form, or the original Supreme Personality of God, in the spiritual world. Realization may be distant. When you are chanting Hare Krishna, Krishna is dancing on your tongue. Realization that He is dancing on the tongue may be distant. But the truth of the Shastra, that Shastra reveals, He is incarnated, He is there. So therefore, in japa, before we get realization, we need to have Shraddha. So with Shraddha, in the Shastra, Shraddha means, you feel the truth. You feel that this is true, that here is Krishna. And then you feel the truth also, that I am distant from Him, because of my impurities. In terms of consciousness, I am distant from Him, because I am a Sadaka. I will worship Him, I will worship Him in this way, and I will purify myself, and when I awaken my bhakti, then there is no difference between me and Him.

#### respect, super-soul, Vaishnava etiquette

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Offering respect to his devotee is more valuable than offering respect to him."
**Summary:** This segment explains that offering respect to a Vaishnava is offering respect to Vishnu, as Vaishnavas are temples of Vishnu, and that respect is ultimately offered to the super-soul within.

It may be argued that since Daksha was the father-in-law of Lord Shiva, it was certainly the duty of Lord Shiva to offer him respect. In answer to that argument, it is explained here that when a learned person stands up or offers obeisances in welcome, he offers respect to the super-soul who is sitting within everyone's heart. It is seen, therefore, among Vaishnavas that even when a disciple offers obeisance to a spiritual master, the spiritual master immediately returns the obeisances because they are mutually offered not to the body but to the super-soul. Therefore, the spiritual master also offers respect to the super-soul situated in the body of the disciple. The Lord says in Srimad Bhagavatam that offering respect to his devotee is more valuable than offering respect to him. Devotees do not identify with the body. So, offering respect to a Vaishnava means offering respect to Vishnu. It is stated there also that as a matter of etiquette, as soon as one sees a Vaishnava, one must immediately offer him respect, indicating the super-soul sitting within. A Vaishnava sees the body of a temple of Vishnu. Since Lord Shiva already has offered respect to the super-soul in Krishna consciousness, offering respect to Daksha, who has identified with the body, was already performed, there is no need to offer respect to his body, for that is not directed by any Vedic injunction. Thus ends.

**Summary:** This segment differentiates between social conventions of respect and the transcendental understanding of offering respect to the super-soul, noting that social conventions dictate respecting elders like a father-in-law.

So, a very important principle, Srimad Bhagavatamin Θahahaha D sympathy, kenasṁ davanti één ye que Caitanya who does not believe Therefrom and contemplate only the He is being explained by Lord Shiva to his young wife, Sati. Basically, Lord Shiva is saying that I never disrespected Dakshya. There is a social convention, which is first line. Certainly, friends and relatives offer mutual greetings by standing up, welcoming one another and offering obeisances. This is Vivaharik social convention. Next he says, Paramarthi, those who are elevated to transcendental platform being intelligent, offer such respects to super souls. Those who are sitting within the body, not to the person who identifies with the body. So, the two different perspectives. And Lord Shiva is saying that those who understand the soul, the super soul and the body, which is the body of, which the soul identifies with, the three things. There is nothing much to explain about the social convention. There is not much philosophy in it. Socially somebody is more respectable, less respectable, no doubt. Father-in-law should be respected more, must be respected by the son-in-law. These are social conventions.

**Key Quote:** "When we give respect to the super soul, the pure soul is included in it."
**Summary:** This segment explains that transcendentalists act based on pure knowledge, giving respect to the super-soul within the body and not to the false ego, including the pure soul in that respect.

When it comes to the transcendental understanding of giving respect, it is, everything that the transcendentalist does, is based on knowledge, pure knowledge. So, externally the act may be the same as, the other act, same as the social act. But, the way the transcendentalists do the act, why they do the act, is different. Lord Shiva is explaining here that when a person who is enlightened about the things as they are, then they, when they, they give respects to the super soul within the body and not to the false ego. When we give respect to the super soul, the pure soul is included in it. The pure soul or the awakened soul or the pure soul in a body which is driven by false ego, is practically sleeping. So, one gives obeisances to the super soul. There is nothing, the soul who is accompanied with the super soul or the super soul is accompanied by the soul, either way, they are never separated. False ego is separated, soul is separated, in the mind of an enlightened person. And he gives, he offers his obeisances to the super soul and the soul. And the soul is not the false ego because they have identified with the body. That here, Lord Shiva clearly says, not to the person who identifies with the body.

**Key Quote:** "Paying obeisances, physically, or paying obeisances in the mind, is no difference as far as the internal consciousness of the enlightened person is concerned."
**Summary:** This segment discusses whether obeisances are paid to the soul or only the super-soul, explaining that paying respects to someone identified with the material body is a social convention, while enlightened individuals pay respects internally to the soul and super-soul.

So, is it that we never pay obeisances, we never pay respects to the soul? Do we pay respects only to the super soul? No, no, no, no, no. Anybody who is, person who is identified with the, with the material body, to that person is, if you pay obeisances, then that is social. False ego. Devotees are not interested in that. Interested means they act out of, out of transcendental platform. That doesn't mean they don't act, they don't, they are not affected. Even if, let us say, somebody is, because Krishna says, even self-realized person, they act within the conventions of this material world. Just to set example. But when they do that also, even if Lord Shiva had paid obeisances to, to Daksha, not that he should not have, should never, even if he had paid obeisances to Daksha, it will be in knowledge. Just to, for social convention. He knows it just for social convention. Because he has to set an example. Here it is not that Lord Shiva, last purport became very clear, that it is not that Lord Shiva intentionally said, Oh, I am greater than him, so I should not pay obeisances. He did not mean that. By the time he observed Daksha entering the sacrificial arena, already he lost his temper, and Daksha started attacking. He did not notice Daksha entering the sacrificial arena. That is explained in the last verse. So, paying obeisances, physically, or paying obeisances in the mind, is no difference as far as the internal consciousness of the enlightened person is concerned. And whether externally he should pay obeisances, or not, whether, whatever internally he is paying respects to the soul and the super soul, and to the false ego, if for social conventions. And to the false ego for social conventions.

**Summary:** This segment explains that an enlightened person acts in service of the Supreme Lord in every situation, even when following social conventions, and discusses the spiritual master's role in teaching disciples about serving Krishna.

He acts in each situation, in service of the Supreme Lord. If out of social convention, if he has to do that, he will do it. But he knows that it is only out of social convention. The soul is identifying with the body. Therefore, you know, this is only a social convention. But for those who do not identify with their bodies, they are as good as the super soul in their quality. They are the same quality as the super soul. So, it is a great occasion to offer respects to that body, body itself. Because, the body itself is serving the soul and the super soul. So, it becomes a temple of God, an active temple of God, you can say. Everybody's body is a temple of God, because super soul is seated in their heart. But those who are acting as a servant of the super soul, engaged in devotion service of the Lord, disidentifying with their body, but utilizing their body as an instrument to serve the Lord, to such persons, you are actually paying obeisance to the super soul and the person together. And here, Prabhupada is saying that the spiritual master also sometimes pays obeisances back to the disciple. Various conceptions could, two, three different conceptions could be there in the spiritual master's mind in doing that. One is to teach the principle to the disciple that we are all servants of Krishna and we are serving the... I am your servant as a spiritual master. You are servant of Krishna as my disciple. I am servant of Krishna as a spiritual master. Both have their role to please the Supreme Lord

#### spiritual master, disciple, false ego, social convention

**Key Quote:** "So, the obeisances will be taken by the false ego and then it will become, he makes an offense because he thinks that spiritual master is respecting him."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the complexities of the spiritual master-disciple relationship, particularly regarding obeisances, and how a neophyte disciple's false ego can lead to offenses if the spiritual master returns obeisances.

But normally the disciples are not very enlightened to understand these things. So, even this transcendental message to convey, if the spiritual master pays obeisances to the disciple, then the disciple pays obeisances to the spiritual master, it can happen, but it does not have to happen, because the spiritual master also has a duty. If there is a neophyte, if he does not, if he is advanced, yes, very nice. But the principle is understood. If you, if the spiritual master pays obeisances to, back to this disciple, a neophyte disciple, now comes to social convention because he is in the platform of false ego. So, the obeisances will be taken by the false ego and then it will become, he makes an offense because he thinks that spiritual master is respecting him. I am such a great disciple, I am being respected by my spiritual master. So, immediately he makes an offense to the spiritual master. So, the spiritual master has to act in a very, in a way in which he serves his function as a guru. Therefore, he does not pay back obeisances to the false ego. And through social convention, the disciple only pays obeisances to the spiritual master and the spiritual, the false ego will become, more, false ego will decrease or the false ego will, will purify. By, false ego means what? Lauding, lauding. So, by paying obeisances, the false ego will, the lauding false ego will decrease. And at least for that moment, he will act, I am servant of somebody, I am subordinate to somebody, I have to respect somebody. So, we have to understand this principle beautifully explained by Lord Shiva in this verse.

**Key Quote:** "Any respects that is received, if it ends with you, then, if it has to end with you, it has, that respect has to be eaten by your false ego, consumed, consumed by your false ego."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how a spiritual master might return obeisances to a mature disciple and emphasizes that all respect received should be offered to the Supreme Lord to avoid feeding the false ego.

Then application may be different in different situations. In particular, some situations, it is not impossible for the spiritual master to give back the obeisances to his disciple. Because he knows the spirit, my disciple is mature, he doesn't, he, he has already crossed those barriers and he understands why I am doing this. Now, in other cases, in other situations, even in, even in the case of a neophyte disciple, the spiritual master, ok, take spiritual master or even take a senior, a senior devotee or a spiritual master, in his heart he pays obeisances to the super soul. At no cost, any living entity, even spiritual master, receives somebody's respects without offering it to the Lord. Any respects that is received, if it ends with you, then, if it has to end with you, it has, that respect has to be eaten by your false ego, consumed, consumed by your false ego. So, anybody who is interested in spiritual life, the basic principle is to learn how to be the servant of the servant of the servant. If within the heart, if anybody pays respects and if a senior just receives it, thinking ok, he is, he is, he is, he ought to give me respect, then he is on the bodily platform, that means his false ego is receiving respect. If somebody is not respecting, then he gets hurt. Why I am senior devotee, why I have not been respected by the junior devotees? He gets hurt, he should never get hurt, but he should be concerned, why is that junior devotee not learning what he has to learn to respect the senior devotees? Why is he not learning? So, in that, in that aspect, he has a duty, because that is the purpose of somebody giving respect and taking respect in the heart

**Key Quote:** "It is the responsibility of the senior to take it and offer it to the super soul."
**Summary:** This segment explains that because neophyte devotees are on a social platform and cannot give respect to the super soul, it is the responsibility of senior devotees to take the respect and offer it to the super soul.

Because the neophyte devotee, neophyte devotee, he cannot, he is not, he is not understanding, he cannot give respect to the super soul and the soul, all those things, because he is in a social platform, so he pays obeisances, he gives respect, it is the responsibility of the senior to take it and offer it to the super soul. Then it becomes, then the soul is receiving that respect for, on behalf of the super soul. So to, it takes a long time of spiritual journey of practice of Bhakti Yoga, to see every living entity as this, you know, combined, inseparable combination of soul and super soul. It takes time. We have to come out of our bodily concept, we have to take everybody out of their bodily concept in our mind. They may be in bodily concept, but we should take everybody out of the bodily concept. We should not see others as their bodies. So if the principle is understood, basically what is this principle? In one line, these paying obeisances, as for a spiritualist are concerned, it is not for false ego. At the same time, we are in this material world. So, these conventions are also required. If at all by, we follow the conventions, it is sake of convention only. There also we only, we follow the convention, but actually in our heart, we are paying obeisances, we are giving respect to the super soul. Because Lord is everywhere, I can give respect anywhere. No bar. So enlightened person does not give respect to false egos. The person with false ego may be thinking out of, he does not know that out of convention, a person is paying obeisances to him. An enlightened person is paying obeisances to him.

**Key Quote:** "Enlightened people do it for the super soul."
**Summary:** This segment discusses how enlightened people offer respect to the super soul, even when following social conventions, and that a pure, enlightened soul is not different from the super soul.

Maybe just because he is father-in-law or whatever it is. He may not understand. He will take, okay for my false ego is given. But he is enlightened person, even if it is father-in-law, he is giving it to the super soul. All this bodily identification, father-in-law, son-in-law, all those things are purely on the social convention. Enlightened people do it for the super soul. Super soul, soul, a pure soul, a pure enlightened soul is not different from the super soul. So it is for the combination. Because question may ask, so you do not respect the soul at all? Only it is for the super soul we pay obeisances? No. If the soul is spiritual, if the soul is enlightened, soul has attained the quality of the super soul, then when you are paying obeisances to the super soul, you are already paying obeisances. You are even giving respects to the soul also. Just like somebody can say, I pay obeisances to Prabhupada. Am I paying respect to Prabhupada or only the super soul? Prabhupada. Hmm? You are paying respects to both. You are paying respects to both. Because he is of the same, he is awakened and he is of the same quality as the super soul. His identity that manifests in this material world is pure identity. There is no false ego. His real ego is manifesting. So if his real ego is there, real superego is super soul. Real ego is also servant of Krishna. So I am actually paying my obeisances to his real ego and the superego, which is supreme ego, which is the supreme lord. It is also as a matter of etiquette.

So there are etiquettes which are Vaishnava etiquette. There are social etiquettes. And within the Vaishnava community, there is Vaishnava social etiquette. Not everybody, everybody is enlightened. To have only etiquette at the Paramarthic level. As I explained the neophyte, the different stages of enlightenment of the devotee, so they need. In fact, even the normal social conventions of inter-human relationship, as per our Sanatana Dharma, the culture is set as a pre-runner to proper, pre-runner to inter-flow of respect as per proper

If somebody offers respect, he has to offer respect to, son has to offer respect to the father, and his son will offer respect to him. Just see, it's not that, you know, somebody even in social convention, he is only receiving respect. He has to give respect also. In social convention, because it is based on material qualifications, and this and that, and all those karma, and all those things. But the principle is still practiced, so that the principle of respect is there in our Dharma, which is not there in the western civilization. Within the family system itself, there is culture, this value is cultured. You take the blessings of the parents, in India it's so common, take blessings of parents before going for examination. That may not be there now, at least nowadays we used to do. These they don't, they may not be there also. In good cultured family, yes, it will be there. Some cultured families, so much so that, as soon as they get up in the morning, first time they see father and mother, they have to pay obeisance, they touch their feet. You know, so much significance is there, in this kind of practices.

**Key Quote:** "To the degree to which the soul is awakened, the soul will receive the, spiritually, the degree to which he is awakened and the degree to which there is a combination."
**Summary:** This segment answers a question about the extra level of respect given to a devotee, explaining that it is due to the greater manifestation and awakening of the soul in a devotee.

I have two questions for you. The first question is, you told that, body is a temple of Lord. So, Lord and Jeeva is present, both in a karmi's body and also devotee's body. So now, what is the extra level of respect, so I should respect everyone, what is the extra respect which I should give to a devotee? So my understanding is, because with the thinking and feeling, they engage this body also in the service of Lord. So that is the extra respect I give to the devotee, because a devotee is also not a body, he is a soul and the super soul is also with him. Right. What is, in a devotee, more of his soul is manifest. Manifest means, more of it is awakened. If there is awakened, if there is awakening, then there is, for instance, a person is sleeping. So you, you pay obeisance to him. What is, you, he is sleeping, no, might as well don't pay. So if somebody is little awake, okay, there is exchange of respect. So it, to the degree to which the soul is awakened, the soul will receive the, spiritually, the degree to which he is awakened and the degree to which there is a combination. There is a false ego most of the time and there is, sometimes there is manifestation of, of one's real ego. Or it's a mixture, just like you wake up from the dream. Right. You are in a mixed state. Your half mind is in the dream, half mind, half mind is in the reality. So it takes some time for you to come out of the dream world and go into the reality.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the oscillating state of consciousness between sleeping and wakeful states, and how doing service with false ego or for social recognition can disturb devotional service.

So we are all like that. We are all half awake, quarter awake, some percentage we are awake. We are not fully awake. So because we are not fully awake, when half awake, suddenly some sense gratification comes, we become fully sleepy and full false ego takes over. So we are oscillating, our state of consciousness is oscillating between sleeping state and wakeful state. When you are in good association, when you are fired up, when you do your good chanting and all these things, then when you associate with the holy name, nice kirtan and all those things, after that, you actually, you are spiritually more awake. And when you are spiritually more awake, we will be able to do our service free from false ego. When we do our service with false ego, then it has all complications are there. So many disturbances even in our devotional service comes because of doing service with false ego or doing service for social rasa, social recognition, criterion for or motivation for service is not independent motivation between you, your thoughts, authorities, Prabhupada and Krishna. It is not that you have your own motivation of what the devotees will think, what the society will think, how much result I brought, how much result I did not bring. Criterion, we become servant of the society and not servant of Prabhupada and Krishna. When you become servant of the society, then when you become depressed, then you get unnecessarily stress in your service, then there is, it affects one's spiritual life.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes doing service for the satisfaction of Prabhupada and Krishna, not being attached to results, and understanding that the work is your job, but the result is Krishna's domain, referencing Bhagavad Gita.

If one is doing service for the satisfaction of Prabhupada and Krishna directly, that's my criterion, then, even if results don't come, then Krishna says, you are spiritually situated, you see it is at, Krishna says, don't be attached to results. You work in a Krishna conscious way, Madashraya, depend upon me, take shelter of me and work, don't independently work. Not that I independently work and go and give something. Devotion service is never independent work. Devotion service is, just like taking something, just like Ganges water you take and pour back into the Ganges. Devotion, nature of devotion service is that, not that somewhere you bring water which belongs to somebody and you give it to Krishna. Everything, my body belongs to him, but I am taking it and I am offering it. So depending on him, where I will get water, you depend upon him. Results depend upon him and then serve Krishna. Krishna wants that love of offering. Krishna wants, Bhavagrahi Janardana, that is what he wants. Result, he is the one who is doing, he is the one who is giving. The service, the work that leads to the result is your job. The result is his job. That is the first thing that Krishna teaches

in Bhagavad Gita. How to work, the art of work. Take pressures, take stress. In the work itself of the day, the day's work, you take pressure. What I have to do, what I have to do. Don't give a little space for Maya to come. Don't sit the whole day and think, you know, get obsessed with the result. Result will come or not. Result will come or not. And none of your business will come or not will be decided by Krishna. That's what he is telling, Krishna is telling in the Bhagavad Gita. Super soul is the awarder of all results. So for devotees also, he is the awarder of. That's his domain. Result is his domain. I have to intellectually think of the result, not emotionally, getting it, not getting it. You have to intellectually think about the result because you will, it will give you direction how to do work. So we do think about the result of the activity, but we do not emotionalize the results, outcome of the results. We want results, we will be happy if we can offer to Krishna. But the outcome, you don't emotionalize. I should succeed. If I succeed, if I don't succeed, it is a failure of devotional service. If you have sincerely put your work towards the result, then it is already success for devotee, devotional service. That is, you can be succeed only, you can succeed only in your domain. How you can succeed in somebody else's domain? Results are always in the domain of the Supersoul.

For every living entity, Karmi, everybody, he is a sanctioner of the desires. Devotees have desires for Krishna, that is the only difference. But desires for Krishna also, Krishna only has to satisfy in this material world, it is like that. Because he is the Parameshwara. Any other question? The second question is, you told that Prabhupada has also Jeevatma and Paramatma. So we have to offer respect to both. So now, the question is, I am seeing him as a manifestation of Paramatma. Tatva wise, okay, it is Jeevatma and Paramatma. But because all the knowledge, what all experience he has given about Krishna, or devotional service, is actually coming from him. So I am seeing him as directly the instructions or means from Supersoul. So is that attitude correct? Directly, last line? No, means whatever, I am seeing, I am not seeing that duality in Prabhupada, like Jeevatma, Prabhupada is a Jeeva, or I am just seeing him as a, okay, Supersoul is acting through him completely.

**Summary:** This segment answers the question about seeing Prabhupada as a manifestation of Paramatma, explaining that while Prabhupada is a Jeevatma, he is a transparent via media for the Supersoul, and we should give him devotional credit for his service and appreciate his qualities.

So is that attitude right? Tatva wise, there is Jeevatma and Paramatma. That is true. But I am asking, that I am, whatever experience… Yeah, but the Jeevatma has got, you have to see Jeevatma with his devotion, with his spirit, to serve the Supersoul. So you are getting that instruction from the Supersoul. He is a transparent via media. So you have to give him devotional credit for his transparent via media. You have to give devotional credit for his service to the Supreme Lord. And therefore, he is serving us. So where do we get such souls who will be transparent and will act as a medium? Because I cannot receive instruction from the Supersoul, who, by my spiritual Master's mercy, I get directed in my service. Asya Prasadat, Bhagavata Prasadat, so by his mercy I am able to get direction of the Supersoul who is in my heart. So therefore, we have to see the truth is to be seen, no? It is not simply, you know, transparent via media means it's, it's a language used, but it's a personal transparent via media. It's not an impersonal transparent via media like a glass. It's a, it's a personal via media, personal via media means only his wishes, it goes to him and he's the soul enjoyer. Supersoul is a soul enjoyer. But that spiritual Master is a person. So therefore, we start appreciating the qualities of that person, qualities of Supersoul. Then we become qualities of the spiritual Masters. Then we become attached to the spiritual Master. So all these things are very much part of the devotee's life. He has to become attached to the spiritual Master, grateful to the spiritual Master, all these things.

**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa explains how food offered to the Lord becomes sanctified and spiritualized, having a transcendental effect.

We distribute food that is sanctified. It's not about even material purity; when it becomes sanctified by offering to the Lord, with gratitude to the Lord for providing this for existence, that makes it super sanctified, spiritually sanctified. It has got a very curative, healing, transcendental effect for the good of the person who honors sanctified food, and that is what we are distributing. And how is it sanctified? The Lord sanctifies it transcendentally. He sees the—the Lord eats our—it's a mystical process. Every lot is not offered; the Lord knows thousands of people are coming every day. Mass distribution of prasadam means, you know, it's a different kind of, you know, leela of the Lord, you see. Just like shaktivesha nama, Lord shakti enters in it. Similarly, food, when it is offered to the Lord, it is spiritualized food; it is matter.

**Key Quote:** "Unless one is fortunate enough to have the dust of the lotus feet of a mahatma on one's head, there is no possibility of perfection in spiritual life."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of the parampara system and the grace of a spiritual master in achieving spiritual perfection, highlighting that rituals alone are insufficient without the blessings of a great soul.

Translation on purpose by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. Translation: It is my good fortune that I have been able to see you, for you cannot easily be seen by persons who have not subdued the mind or controlled the senses. I am all the more fortunate to have touched my head to the blessed dust of your feet. Purport by Srila Prabhupada: The perfection of transcendental life can be achieved simply by touching the holy dust of the feet of a holy man. In the Bhagavatam it is said, mahat pada rajo 'bhishekam, which means to be blessed by the holy dust of the lotus feet of a mahat, or great devotee. As stated in Bhagavad Gita, mahatmanas tu, those who are great souls are under the spell of spiritual energy, and their symptom is that they fully engage in Krishna consciousness for the service of the Lord. Therefore, they are called mahatmas. Unless one is fortunate enough to have the dust of the lotus feet of a mahatma on one's head, there is no possibility of perfection in spiritual life. The parampara system of disciplic succession is very important as a means of spiritual success. One becomes a mahat by the grace of his mahat spiritual master. If one takes shelter of the lotus feet of a great soul, there is every possibility of one's also becoming a great soul. When Maharaj Rahugana asked Jadabharata about his wonderful achievements of spiritual success, he replied to the king that spiritual success is not possible simply by following the rituals of religion or simply by converting oneself into a sanyasi or offering sacrifices as recommended in the scriptures. These methods are undoubtedly helpful for spiritual realization, but the real effect is brought about by the grace of a mahatma. By the grace of a mahatma, in Vishvanatha Chakravarti Thakura's eight stanzas of prayers to the spiritual master, it is clearly stated that simply by satisfying the spiritual master, one can achieve the supreme success in life, and in spite of executing all ritualistic performances, if one cannot satisfy the spiritual master, one has no access to spiritual perfection. Here the word akritatmanam is very significant. Atma means body, soul, or mind, and akritatma means the common man who cannot control the senses or the mind. Because the common man is unable to control the senses and the mind, it is his duty to seek the shelter of a great soul or a great devotee of the Lord and just try to please him. That will make his life perfect. A common man cannot rise to the topmost stage of spiritual realization simply by following the rituals and religious principles. He has to take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and work under his direction faithfully and sincerely, then he becomes perfect without a doubt.

**Summary:** This segment discusses various ways to receive mercy, including prasadam, darshan of deities, and the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee, emphasizing that these are not merely metaphorical but real and potent.

They are in the place of pilgrimages. People go to the place of pilgrimage, then they take their blessings. This is the culture, sanatana dharma culture. So here we see that Manu is praising the value of contacting the dust of a great personality. You have been released, released for hot, for top, told, om, and there are unlimited ways in which this mercy is actually transmitted, and we can list so many things which for our senses like prasadam. By contacting the prasadam, we get mercy with our tongue. By having darshana of the deities, we get mercy. By hearing, by hearing, we get mercy. By worshiping, we get mercy. By taking, we get mercy. One more item is here which is highly potent for making advancement in spiritual life. What is that? The dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee. This is not metaphorical; it is actually the real dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee. If one is able to place the dust on his head, then one gets special mercy. These are all ways of receiving the mercy which are not phenomenally calculatable through some material phenomena. What is the value of a dust? Take the dust of the lotus feet of Prabhupada. Here is deity, whole day deity is here. Some dust will collect. Water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, and us upyogation to bahut karenge.

**Key Quote:** "Just by reading you don't get transcendental knowledge; when you read, Prabhupada should act on you through these pages, then you get transcendental mercy."
**Summary:** This segment explains that spiritual relationships and transcendental knowledge are not transactional, and that true understanding and realization come through the personal mercy of a pure devotee, like Srila Prabhupada, not just through mechanical reading or rituals.

So this is the meaning of mercy. Our mind is always used to transactional things. That means, you know, I pay for it, I get it. Our relationship, spiritual relationship with the deity, relationship with the holy name, our relationship with the spiritual master, our relationship with Vaishnavas, we cannot think in terms of a transaction. What do you get from Srila Prabhupada? No, I get transcendental knowledge. How do you get transcendental knowledge? Because books are there, I read, I get transcendental knowledge. Just by reading, you don't get transcendental knowledge. When you read, Prabhupada should act on you through these pages, then you get transcendental mercy, then you get mercy, then you get understanding, then you get realization. So one should understand that reading Prabhupada's books or anything, contacting any of the forms of mercy of the Lord is not something that can be mechanically, ritualistically achieved. That Prabhupada explains it, just by ritual one cannot, you know, get it done by the Lord. It is bhakti. Even if one chants 16 rounds, it may help, Prabhupada is saying it may help, but he will have no access to spiritual perfection. Access to spiritual perfection means you have to get the personal mercy of a pure devotee, not general mercy. General mercy is available. Prabhupada's books are available everywhere, general mercy. Personal mercy means yes, Prabhupada gets linked to you when you get initiated, he links to you and he is your personal spiritual master. He is not only teaching you, there are so many other things he is doing to you. He is monitoring to you. He and Chaitya Guru together is monitoring to you, monitoring your growth, spiritual growth.

**Key Quote:** "Whatever I have is a kripa of my spiritual master; I have not earned it."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that spiritual progress is primarily due to the mercy of the spiritual master, obtained through service and pleasing him, which can purify one and lead to control of the senses and mind, even if one is initially unable to do so.

Therefore, the Vaishnavas always say that I am made up of the mercy of my spiritual master. Whatever I have is a kripa of my spiritual master. If I have some standing, if I have some detachment, it is given by my spiritual master. I have not earned it. He believes it. I have not earned it. Why? Because he understands that actually by any bodily action, by tongue, moving your tongue sixteen rounds and all, you cannot get bhakti. You can get bhakti when you move sixteen rounds. It will give you some foundation, but ultimately you have to get the personal mercy of the spiritual master which comes by, here Prabhupada is giving that secret here, by serving a bona fide spiritual master, by serving him one gets that. Because the common man is unable to control the spiritual life, and the mind, it is his duty to seek shelter of a great soul or a great devotee of the Lord and just try to please him. Just see, do service to him and try to please him, then even if you cannot control your senses and mind, still by his mercy you will purify. Very soon you will be able to control your senses.

#### mercy, spiritual master, attitude, effort, determination

**Key Quote:** "The real perfection or the result of all that comes only by the personal mercy of the spiritual master."
**Summary:** This segment highlights that while secondary instructions and exercises are helpful, the real perfection comes from the personal mercy of the spiritual master, and that one's attitude and determination to serve are key to attracting that mercy, as illustrated by the story of the sparrow.

So therefore one should understand that the easiest, though we may do all the exercises that we are trying to do, so many secondary instructions are there, control this, shamas, damas, tapas, all these things are there. We are trying to follow all those things. While following those things, one should understand that the result of the real perfection or the result of all that comes only by the personal mercy of the spiritual master, and this has to be practiced by the devotee because you don't see with your eyes. It is a matter of faith. From this yasya prasadat bhagavata prasadat, everyday we are singing, but we cannot see how it is happening. When you see something, somebody gives you something, you know, gross in your hand, you say thank you because you see he has given, but we have to learn how to transcendentally see this through the descending process that everyday we have to say thank you, thank you, thank you. Every moment we have to go on saying thank you, thank you, thank you to Srila Prabhupada, to Guru and Krishna. Continuously they are giving. So what is the spiritual process of spiritual advancement, spiritual progress in our Sampradaya? It is always beg for the mercy of the devotees, beg for the mercy of the Vaishnavas. Then one may think what is my role? Shouldn't I do anything? No, one should do, but one should understand that what one does is simply to show our attitude to the spiritual master that I am serious about it, I want your mercy, I am serious about following your instruction. Just like the story in Bhagavad Gita, Prabhupada explains about the sparrow trying to recover her eggs from the ocean. She was so determined that she was trying to take out drop by drop water through her beaks and trying to empty the ocean, but finally her, obviously, you know, by material calculation, can a sparrow empty the ocean? Not possible. Her goal was what? To get the eggs back, but then she got mercy of Garuda. She got the egg back. Why was Garuda attracted? Because of her determination. In the same way, to attract the mercy of the Lord, it is not the quantum of skill, the quantum of what you have given and all these things is not what the attitude, if the attitude to attract the mercy of the Lord is there.

**Summary:** This segment discusses the balance between effort and mercy, emphasizing that while effort (sadhana) is essential, the result is ultimately due to the mercy of the guru, and one should not take away the guru's credit for one's advancement.

What you need, guru will give. Whatever you need for his service, whatever you need for your advancement, the guru will bestow upon us. So this is a process by which, you know, we need to balance effort and mercy. What is the value that you give to your effort, your sadhana, this thing, effort, and in your mind what is the value as far as doing is concerned, your effort? You have to do, but as far as result is concerned, one should not think my effort was a very big factor. As far as doing is concerned, yes, I have to do. I cannot spare anything. I have to do. As far as result is concerned, oh, I chanted so many years very nicely, now I have advanced. You can say that I have chanted nicely so long for by Prabhupada's mercy my chanting has become fruitful. I got mercy. You can say that. You cannot take away Prabhupada. You cannot take away guru's mercy.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "When you submissively hear, then the feelings also you get, and the feelings go, the transformation that happens for a person is faster."
**Summary:** This segment explains the difference between intellectual and submissive hearing, highlighting that submissive hearing allows one to grasp the feelings of the speaker, leading to faster transformation, and that a rational mind can be a barrier to receiving mercy.

Just like let us say we hear Srimad Bhagavatam class. It is said that one has to submissively hear. You can submissively hear, you can intellectually hear also. When you intellectually hear, you will only get the ideas. When you submissively hear, you will get the feelings of the speaker. When somebody speaks, he speaks what? Ideas, feelings, realization, right? He speaks. You submissively hear, then the feelings also you get, and the feelings go. The transformation that happens for a person is faster when you can get the feelings of, let us say, Prabhupada's feelings. If you put a filter of only intellectual thing, let us say Prabhupada lecture you are hearing, ok, ok, philosophical, philosophical, all these things intellectually you are adjusting, but Prabhupada says rascal, then you know it is nothing philosophical. It is not a philosophical idea at all. You get the feeling why Prabhupada is calling this fellow rascal. So that submissiveness is, if you have submissiveness, how will you have submissiveness? Only when there is anticipation you will have submissiveness, otherwise, oh, you would be submissive. Oh, I am expecting something, anticipating. So anticipating mercy of deity, you go before the deity, you have to have anticipation. It does not mean specific prayers, but there is mercy coming. Chanting Hare Krishna, you have to have anticipation of mercy, being in the presence of a spiritual master, you should get anticipate. So there has to be preparedness for receiving this mercy also, and the rational mind is the biggest enemy.

**Summary:** This segment reiterates that a rational mind can hinder spiritual progress, and that rapid advancement requires understanding the vibration of every situation and relying on the descending process of mercy, emphasizing the importance of taking shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and working under his direction.

The rational mind, sometimes devotees get stuck in this rational thing for whole life. Everything they intellectualize. They sit in the class, they intellectualize. They go before the deity, they intellectualize. They take association, they intellectualize. You want to make rapid progress, rapid, then you have to understand the vibration of every situation, and then right from descending process that mercy will come and quick advancement will make. A common man cannot rise to the top most stage of spiritual perfection simply by following the rituals and religious principles. Just take shelter of bonafide spiritual master and work under his direction faithfully and sincerely, then he becomes perfect.

**Summary:** This segment addresses the question of how much rationality should be applied in spiritual life, explaining that while rationality can be used to glorify and appreciate, over-rationalizing and speculating can hinder understanding of mercy.

You see, rational, when you are, the good question everywhere, rationality is there. The issue is about being over rational. Just like you say bhakti and vedanta. Vedanta is rational path. Bhakti is not the rational path. It is the mercy path. So in order to glorify, in order to appreciate, in order to, one uses rationality even in bhakti. When rationality is not used in the spiritual life, then when rationality is used to understand the mercy, then it becomes speculation.

**Key Quote:** "Bhakti never stands without knowledge; there is knowledge always."
**Summary:** This segment continues the discussion on rationality, emphasizing that bhakti is founded on knowledge of truth, and that one should not over-endeavor intellectually but rather focus on serving and appreciating the mercy of Prabhupada.

One truth you receive, you don't understand philosophically, you don't understand. Now if you go deep, deep, deep, going on and on and on, speculating too many things, then you are over rational. You need to understand that the rational understanding at the right time, I have to do more service. We can all rationally analyze and somehow to control the senses and all these things rationally analyze. That's what the mayavadhis, impersonalists do. They rationally they analyze what is self concept and this and that all those things. And as devotees, when the right time comes, he comes out of the bodily concept. Now that's what it said, when you have bhakti, you have knowledge also. Bhakti never stands without knowledge. There is knowledge always. There is a very foundation is knowledge. Bhakti is not foundation is not ignorance is knowledge. Knowledge of truth, tattva is always there as a foundation. So how much we should apply our intelligence? Don't over endeavor. If that intelligence is not coming to you now, serve, continue serving, you will understand. So that is, that is the extent to which you should exercise your, put all your efforts in serving, put your efforts in appreciating the mercy of Prabhupada, all these things.

**Summary:** This segment addresses how to be sure that one is putting in their all effort, explaining that one should strive to put in their best effort but remain humble, acknowledging that Krishna and Prabhupada's mercy are ultimately responsible for any success.

You said Prabhu that we should put our all effort and anticipate. How should I be sure that the effort which I am putting in my devotional service is my all effort or we may be sometime in the miser condition also that I may think that I am putting all my effort but I may not be putting. You should put all your efforts but not think that you have put all your efforts. While putting the efforts you should think I should put best of my efforts but should not think that actually whether I put the best or not I do not know maybe I withheld so many things inside. You should not say I put my best efforts. You say philosophy in life is to put best efforts but whether I really put the best efforts I do not know. So even if you know something fails you will say that I have not put best effort. If he succeeds he will also say I have not put best efforts. Whatever was lacking Krishna and Prabhupada gave and therefore I did it.

**Key Quote:** "Thus Brahmanical culture and crow protection are the basic principles for human civilization."
**Summary:** The speaker reads and explains a verse and purport emphasizing the roles of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas in protecting society and each other, highlighting the importance of Brahmanical culture.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 22, Verse 3: TATRANAYA SHRI CHACCASMAN TATRANAYA SHRI CHACCASMAN DOHA SAHASRAT SAHASRAPAD DOHA SAHASRAT SAHASRAPAD RIDAYAM TASHYAHI BRAMMA RIDAYAM TASHYAHI BRAMMA SATRAM ANRAM PRACHAT SATE SATRAM ANRAM PRACHAT SATE. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "For the protection of the Brahmanas, the thousand-leaded Supreme Being created us, the Satryas, from His thousand arms. Hence the Brahmanas are said to be His heart and the Satryas, His arms." Purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada: "Satryas are specifically meant to maintain the Brahmanas because if the Brahmanas are protected and the head of civilization is protected, Brahmanas are supposed to be protected. Brahmanas are supposed to be the head of the social body. If the head is clear and has not gone mad, then everything is in proper position. The Lord is described thus, Namo Brahmania Devaya, Go Brahmana Hitayacha. The purport of this prayer is that the Lord specifically protects the Brahmanas and the cows, and then He protects all other members of society. It is His will that universal welfare work depends on the protection of cows and Brahmanas. Thus Brahmanical culture and cow protection are the basic principles for human civilization. Satryas are especially meant to protect the Brahmanas, as is the supreme will of the Lord. Go Brahmana Hitayacha. As the Supreme Will of the Lord, Go Brahmana Hitayacha. As the Supreme Will of the Lord, Go Brahmana Hitayacha. Because within the body, the heart is a very important part, so the brahmanas are also the important element in human society. The satryas are more like the whole body. Even though the whole body is bigger than the heart, the heart is more important."

#### Lord as Cause and Effect, Simultaneous Oneness and Difference, Kardama Muni, Manu

**Key Quote:** "See, the Lord is simultaneously one and different from everything in His creation."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of the Lord being both the cause and effect, simultaneously one with and different from His creation, using the example of Manu appearing before Kardama Muni.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta Parvat. This is being explained by Manu to Kardama Muni, starting with saying that, O Kardama Muni, you are a brahmana, and Brahma created you from his face, and you are full of austerity, knowledge, mystic power, and averse to sense gratification. And then for protection of brahmanas like you, the Lord created kshatriyas, who are like him, like Manu, kshatriyas, and the body of a kshatriya, the body of a brahmana, and the lord, through his thousand-legged Supreme Being, created us, the kshatriyas, from his thousand arms. And this way, the brahamanas and kshatriyas protect each other as well as themselves. And the lord who is both the cause and the effect protects them through each other. So, how this is slowly becoming obvious is because there is a time interval here where these two events are lived here. That is not necessary. They are not necessary. They don't matter. We are like water. This entire material world function with the Lord as the cause and effect is finely explained here, who is both the cause and effect and is yet immutable, protects them through each other.

**Key Quote:** "The Lord's role in this material world as a super soul, because ultimately everything is Lord's Leela, is giving an opportunity for the living entities in this material world to express their freedom."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the Lord's various energies and expansions, including the Super Soul, and emphasizes that the Lord's role in the material world is to provide living entities with the opportunity to exercise their free will.

See, the Lord is simultaneously one and different from everything in His creation. So when, just like when Manu appeared before Kardamuni, the way Kardamuni looked at him, the perspective with which he looked at him, he was addressing him as a Lord because he saw that, because he understood that a perfect Kshatriya is representing the Lord, and he is a Lord in one sense. So everybody, ultimately everything in existence is the Lord through His energies. We are one kind of energies, expansion of the Lord. Material energy is another kind of energy. So, so many different energies are, the Lord has got unlimited, vividaya shakti, unlimited varieties of shaktis are there. It belongs to the Lord and ultimately all the shaktis are functioning for the pleasure of one single personality, Krishna, Adipurusha and His expansions, different Vishnus. So in the material world, a particular Vishnu as Shirodakshaya Vishnu, Garbhodakshaya Vishnu, Karnodakshaya Vishnu, Garbhodakshaya Vishnu and Shirodakshaya Vishnu directly, more directly, involved with every activities in this material world, starting from. But that activity of the Lord as the super soul is in creating this material world, giving shape to this material world, facilitating all the secondary creation of Brahma. So He is involved in that sense. But in which way He is not involved? At a macro level, the super soul is involved. And at the individual level, with respect to people's karma, it is clearly explained that the super soul does not interfere. It is left to the system. His energies, his guna, kala, karma is actually churning this material world, each person's life and it does not interfere there. The Lord's role in this material world as a super soul, because ultimately everything is Lord's Leela, is giving an opportunity for the living entities in this material world to express their freedom. The marginal energy of the Lord to express our freedom, either way.

**Key Quote:** "So, in the material world, if you want anything to happen, it has to be through the material energy only."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Kshetra and Kshetrajna, the connection of the Lord to every heart through the Super Soul, and the necessity of using material energy to accomplish anything in the material world.

So this is a field, Kshetra, where the Kshetrajna, the living entities are given this opportunity. And in this game, the Lord Himself as the supreme proprietor of all the bodies, is Sarvasachaham Rudhisannivishta. So how the Lord is connected to every heart. The Lord is connected to every heart in this material world. That is through the form of the super soul, Shirodaksha Vishnu. And even a more deeper understanding of the super soul, is given here. Just like the sun is on the head of different people and each person feels relationship with the sun above his head. In the same way, the super soul is never divided. I have a super soul for myself, for you and all those things. There is no difference. Though the Lord is personally witnessing and sanctioning all the activities of the individual living entity, the Lord is undivided. In this example is given of the sun over different people's head. Sun which is millions of miles away. Similarly, Shirodaksha Vishnu, He is the supreme proprietor of everything in this material world. He is the supreme Param Eeshwara of everything in this material world. And that Param Eeshwara Leela is performed by the Lord with respect to living entities, both devotees and demons. The two kinds of living entities. So, living entities between themselves, like the Brahmanas are given certain qualities, Kshatriyas are given certain qualities, the Kshatriya body is given certain qualities, the Brahmana body is given certain qualities. It is all given by the Lord. And between themselves, they protect each other. So, in the material world, if you want anything to happen, it has to be through the material energy only. Just like you want to clean your face, you have to take your material hand and clean your material face. Is it not? So, in the same way, everything that has to happen in this material world, it is designed in such a way,

**Key Quote:** "Activity in this material world means nothing but reorganizing matter."
**Summary:** The speaker defines activity in the material world as reorganizing matter using intelligence, and explains why atheists may not perceive God's presence due to the designed godless atmosphere.

it has to happen through the material energy. The metal energy itself has to reconfigure. For instance, we have to build this temple, we have to bring cement, so many things from different places, brick and everything. These things are all just reconfigured here, but they were already existing. So, this reconfiguration is what is called as work in this material world. Reconfiguration for different objectives. What is our objective? We want to create a visual shelter for the Lord, a visual beautiful place like this. This is our purpose. And then we reorganize everything. So, activity in this material world means nothing but reorganizing matter. And we are... The key element for reorganizing matter is buddhi, intelligence. And Prabhupada says that the super soul is realized in this material world as intelligence form. The all-pervading intelligence, everywhere that intelligence is there. Of course, that intelligence is given according to one's karma. There is a... Each individual body has got certain intelligence which is deposited. Certain intelligence, certain type of intelligence, brahmana intelligence, kshatriya intelligence, shudra intelligence, is all deposited in the sharira, the body of the living entity. And then that works. And that's how the society is running. That is the reason why atheists are not able to locate the factor of God. Where is God? You don't need God at all. Everything is running. I don't see God's factor at all. One human being is protecting another human being. Why do you say God protected? One set of human beings are feeding the other set of human beings. The farmers are working. They are producing food. So you are getting food. Why are you thanking God? Where is God in the picture? Why is it so? It is so because it is designed like that. God wants to create an atmosphere where you can forget Him. This material world is meant for that. So it is working very perfectly. Those who don't want to see God will never see God. Those who don't want to see God will be thoroughly convinced there is no God.

**Key Quote:** "Lord's feeling towards the material world is of high respect for our free will."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the role of the Paramatma as the Chaitya Guru, guiding all living entities on their spiritual journey with respect for their free will.

Because whatever the Lord does, He will do it perfectly. He wanted to create a godless atmosphere. He has created it. And in the midst of it, now come to the what role the Paramatma, the Lord plays with respect to those who want to serve Him. Those who want to serve Him, the Lord acts as the Chaitya Guru for the living entity. Not only for Vaishnavas, for everybody. He is a Chaitya Guru for everyone. He is a teacher for everyone. He sits in the heart of every living entity. Whatever class he may be in, may be in 1st standard, 2nd standard, 3rd standard, Vaishnavism may be graduation level. Karmi may be 2nd standard, 3rd standard. He is also on a spiritual journey. Just like in graduation, our Vaishnava life also, we also go up and we come down, right? We rise our consciousness sometimes up, then we fall down also. Our test we fail, test we pass. We keep going up. Up and down. Same way, every living entity is going up and down. Going on and like this. This journey is facilitated by the Supersoul with utmost respect for the living entity's freedom. This is the key thing. What is the Lord's feeling towards the material world? Lord's feeling towards the material world is of high respect for our free will. Not respect for how we use our free will. But it is respect for our free will. Respect for free will is different from respect for how we use the free will. If somebody uses the free will properly, then your respect for his use of free will. Isn't it? Because why he respects the Lord's respect? Because that is what Jeeva's inherent quality is given to him. The Lord has expanded as Jeeva. Vibhinnamsa. We are Lord only. We are Krishna only. We are Krishna's energy. One in quality with him. So he wants it like that. Lord, he decides what to create, why to create, he knows. That way the living entities are having this freedom and this freedom is respected. This is the understanding of how the living entities are all free in this material world. Those who want to turn towards him at whatever stage may be, the Lord is seated inside and he guides the living entity.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how the Lord guides living entities indirectly through material experiences and directly through a spiritual master, emphasizing the Paramatma's patience and constant guidance.

At a particular stage of maturity the guiding may guide the living entity and they take the form of taking on to a bona fide spiritual master at a particular stage. Before that it may be teaching in so many ways through Adhyatmik, Adhibhautik, Adhidaivik, Kleshas. Constantly it is all incorporated in this material world. Indirect teaching. Metallurgy itself teaches a living entity indirectly. And as we progress, we surrender to a spiritual master, he starts teaching directly. Divya Gyan Hridaya Prakashit. So the principle of teaching, the principle of guiding the living entity is operating always in this material world. It's an amazing thing. It's an amazing thing. The existence of that operating principle of elevating the living entity is an amazing realization that especially a devotee can have. If you take your life from the day you touch Prabhupada's book, the day you came across Vaishnava and today where you are. Nothing has happened by chance. The Paramatma is seated in the heart and he is guiding the living entity. The Lord is very patient.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how the Paramatma remembers everything about the living entity and guides them step-by-step in spiritual life, highlighting the continuous operation of spiritual intelligence or Guru Tattva.

And he remembers everything. We remember what's in our this life. He remembers all our previous lives. He remembers all our anarthas. He remembers all our tendencies. Everything he remembers. And the living entity is and if you see our life as devotees how gradually he gives he teaches A first then B first then C first then D then making sentences then writing an essay just like you learn a language from elements to in the same way from ABC of spiritual life you cannot see one cannot be you cannot tell somebody to understand algebra before understanding arithmetic. Is it not? So arithmetic has to be taught. So some teacher has to have take some guidance, take some intelligence what is my student's level and accordingly he will give. Isn't it? Similarly the Paramatma knows exactly where we stand in our learning of the absolute truth the knowledge, pure knowledge, bhakti everything and step by step he is making us advance in Krishna consciousness. That is why after five years or ten years in Krishna consciousness moment you are a different person from what you were when you entered. You are a person with knowledge. You are a person with some detachment. You are a person with certain perspective of this material world. Who is doing this? It is amazing thing. It is continuously that intelligence principle spiritual intelligence principle is operating on us and we know that it is we may say intelligence principle and all that actually that principle is called Guru Tatva the principle of Guru the principle of Guru is operating one principle of Guru is operating everywhere it is represented by different pure devotees of the Lord and this is very important that every devotee reflects his life now and then how did I understand this? How did I understand this? I never understood this five years back. Now I understood this. We are actually taking for granted so many things Lord is revealing within the heart. We are taking for granted. Some source has to be there and somebody has to be giving it. Mata smritir jnanam apohanam ca Krishna is doing that.

**Key Quote:** "For those who want to go back to Godhead, the Lord personally protects."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that while the Lord generally doesn't interfere with individual karma, He intervenes to protect those who want to return to Godhead, offering liberation from sin.

So we are very lovingly taken care of by the Lord those who want journey back to God He is lovingly taken care of So even though it is said here that they protect themselves through each other the there is a bigger principle operating that for those who want to go back to Godhead the Lord personally protects like I will relieve you from all papa Papa cannot be relieved easily Papa can be relieved only by suffering in the material world. So here Lord puts His finger in and He says sarva papebhyo mokshesh sami ma su chaha He puts, He intervenes and He clears the papa, the reaction of papa for the living entity. So first preliminary understanding is that the Lord does not interfere each person's life according to guna kala karma it goes on. And the next level of understanding is that no, it is not just that He is not only upadrishta and anumantha He is also a guide for the living entities Lord is not going to if you are a devotee of the Lord super soul is not going to if it is required to if you drop this phone no, no it should not go against gravity and it should not break because this is Krishna's phone doesn't happen, you drop it it will break

the Lord has Lord as Paramatma He is His reciprocation in this material world with the devotee is in the form of intelligence but the Lord is not limited to that alone He can do any miracles but that will be in another form as a holy name He will do miracles also He is an incarnation holy name is an incarnation super soul is an incarnation who will give you intelligence He will reciprocate at intelligence guidance, intelligence, direction you cannot achieve anything without intelligence isn't it so if you have limited intelligence if you are a devotee of the Lord He will give you the intelligence by which you can serve Him you can achieve something beyond your karma He will give intelligence so that way the devotee who is always engaging in devotion service when he is executing various tasks he is always anticipating that he is doing as a servant of the Lord the ideal thing is that master is the super soul the proprietor of the work is the super soul I am not the proprietor of the work the enjoyer of the fruit of the work also it's not me I am just an order carrier of the Lord whatever service is mystically coming to me I execute it and I am guided by the Lord the owner of the work is an enjoyer of the work is Him I can have only proprietorship over followership

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the Lord's involvement in the material world through different forms like deities, the holy name, and the Super Soul, highlighting their specific relationships and purposes, especially in spiritualizing daily life through deity worship.

working ok so the second part is the first part is that the second part is that the lord is personally involved in the material world the first part is the lord is not involved but he is protects them through each other within the material energy this thing goes on for the devotees it rises above that and the lord himself intervenes in the form of guidance and then the lord in different forms as a deity as a holy name as incarnation and each form of the lord each type of incarnation of the lord have their very specific kind of relationship with the material world that's why they are all different holy name incarnation is different all krishna super soul is different deities are different deities are different different not in terms of substance difference in terms of their relationship with this material world so we have to respect that when we respect that then we are seeing those spiritual differences when we want intelligence we pray to the super soul the lord as a holy name the lord as a holy name has come down into the material world to purify us to cleanse all the dirt in our heart and to give us to to i mean starting with that into giving us even the highest so that is a reciprocation of the holy name deities reciprocation of the holy name is to give us an opportunity to have a day to day life personal life with the lord day to day personal life means what eating sleeping all these things are there every person you know wakes up in the morning daily life is there how do you spiritualize your daily life deity worship is extremely important we eat what the lord takes you give rest to the lord you celebrate everything if you see everything that you do with the deity is like a living thing like a person in your midst so how do you spiritualize your daily life very specifically it is by relating with the deities and the deities incarnation is meant for that is meant to give us an opportunity to relate with him in a very personal way offering personal services that way

**Key Quote:** "The super soul without getting divided one chiradaksha vishnu is guiding every is in everybody's heart."
**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the difference between the living entity (Kshetrajna) and the Super Soul, emphasizing that the Super Soul remains undivided while residing in everyone's heart, and that Krishna, as the cause of everything (Sarvakarana Karanam), is present within every effect.

so anyway the key point here is that we don't have to repeat many times that the living entity the kshetrajna is different from the super soul super soul is different and super soul see super soul without getting divided can he not be in each one's heart he can be beautiful example his son that prabhupada is giving material example is there son is appearing on everybody's head and each person is thinking he is on my head so in the same way the super soul without getting divided one chiradaksha vishnu is guiding every is in everybody's heart and krishna says it's me because it is his expansion the lord the supreme lord govindamadi purusham he is also inside every atom inside every heart that is as a cause of everything in every effect the cause resides is it not in every effect the cause resides within the atom or in other words within the material energy within the living entity the lord is there that is apart from the super soul super soul is only law of the lord is it not govindamadi sarvakarana karanam as sarvakarana karanam he is there in every every effect in this material world he is there that is a uniqueness of krishna when we say krishna is supreme personality of godhead that is what it is sarvakarana karanam within every kind of within his expansion within vishnu expansion also the cause of vishnu expansion is krishna he is there simultaneously one and different and simultaneously how they are one and different the detail is difference between krishna and vishnu krishna and material energy krishna and jiva how it is one and different description of how it is one and how it is different is little different but it is all expansion of one supreme personality of godhead sarvakarana karanam

**Key Quote:** "The function of Paramatma as we see only happens for this three-dimensional world."
**Summary:** A question is posed about the necessity of the Lord's supervision in the spiritual world, considering the absence of the Paramatma's function as seen in the material world.

any questions mike madhu pandit guru thank you so much for the explanation so generally we find very detailed information given in his purport like amazingly detailed and the description is the lord through this first quadruple expansion then the second quadruple expansion and he comes in this what is called parinamavada the transformation of energies of the lord finally we reach the understanding that the lord is in every heart as you described and that way he supervises and in one sense also because the jiva needs protection he may not is impartial but like a father is looking from a distance the child doing something and he is still witnessing everything so it also said in the scriptures that in the stage of the jiva that becomes by the mercy of the lord enlightened self-realized through the eyes of or the way of seeing the lord in the heart of the self-realized soul is declared is not anymore impartial because the lord in two-handed form or according to the jiva is liberated becomes in that turns into that self proportionally to the development of the soul so the question is that he supervises everything also through this analysis in the external energy but the question is in the spiritual world does he requires this sort of vigilance or this sort of being vigilant like a police forces how the interaction because we don't have so many informations in the spiritual world actually Srila Prabhupada gives a main fantastic description in the fifth the whole I think it's the fifth chapter of Chaitanya Charita Amrita the voice of Nityananda Valarama but he doesn't touch the point of the Paramatma because Paramatma in the spiritual world doesn't exist the function of Paramatma as we see only happens for this three-dimensional world so the question is in the spiritual world is the lord in need to supervise every jiva there

#### Paramatma in Spiritual World, Krishna as Cause, Unmanifested Form, Ishwara Ha Parama Krishna

**Key Quote:** "As Paramatma, not required in the spiritual world. Doesn't have to sit next to the Atma. But as Krishna, as a cause, he is there within the Atma."
**Summary:** The speaker answers that the Paramatma is not required in the spiritual world, but Krishna, as the cause, is present within the Atma in His unmanifested form, manifesting in the material world through the Paramatma's expansion.

... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Lila. So therefore the Lord is there as Paramatma. Very specific kind of Lila. This kind of Lila is not required in the spiritual world. So as Paramatma, not required in the spiritual world. Doesn't have to sit next to the Atma. But as Krishna, as a cause, he is there within the Atma, in his unmanifested form. By me in my unmanifested form, I pervade everywhere. Not only here, everywhere he pervades. That pervading is different from all pervading expansion of, Lila expansion of the Paramatma. So that way Krishna is always everywhere, directly and indirectly in control of everything. So Ishwara Ha Parama Krishna. So that Parama Krishna, that Ishwara, that Ishwara effect is manifesting in the material world through Paramatma, through an expansion of Paramatma. This is what, you know, putting together everything else that we read about. This is what I understand. And somewhere there is one line in Chaitanya Charitamrita, Prabhupada says, there is no Paramatma expansion in this spiritual world. In Chaitanya Charitamrita. It says so. Prabhupada says so. And at the same time, somewhere else, the Lord is always seated in the heart of the living entity. You want to reconcile these two things, then Lord is always seated in the heart of the Jeeva also. Here, when you say Paramatma in the heart of the Jeeva, it is in this body. But there when Krishna is seated in the heart of Jeeva means as a cause he is there. Nothing can be separated from the cause. This is my understanding.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Achieving anything in this material world is nothing but very nicely to oversimplify, just reconfiguring matter."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that achieving anything in the material world is simply reconfiguring matter using Jnana (knowledge), Bala (strength), and Kriya (skill), illustrating with examples like building a temple and the difference between rich and poor.

In this line of thought, when you initiated your dissertation, you also mentioned that as with this material, I cleansed my face using elements of matter to… For an end. Right So you say that we gather elements like concrete, iron to create a temple. Yes. You configure matter. Yes but you mentioned something peculiar because you say the temple is existing. It's existing. Commander I see. Training.束致. Can you elaborate please? You see nothing, nobody created anything. Before let us say only plain land was there. Then what happened? Jnana, Bala, Kriya, three things mixed together and this temple was manifest. Energy did not manifest. Energy was already there. Jnana, Bala and Kriya, what does it do? It reconfigures matter. Somewhere else different matter is there, it brings together. What is a rich man and a poor man? Difference. In the configuration of a rich man, money is in his pocket. When so many donors gave and we built this temple, what did it happen? You went, you used Jnana, Bala, Kriya. The money moved from his pocket to you as a collector. Then it came and the money moved from here to the shopkeeper. He moved that matter here. That's all. It's just nothing but very... Achieving anything in this material world is nothing but very nicely to oversimplify. Just reconfiguring matter. And to reconfigure matter, you need three things: Intelligence, Jnana, Bala, Kriya. Balas are different types. You may have financial Bala, this Bala, that Bala, physical Bala, financial Bala, all these things. Emotional Bala. Tejas is called Bhagavato Balena, Bhagavato Veeryena, Bhagavato Tejasa, we say, when you do something. These are all things required to do something. Okay. Virya is intelligent. Tejas is emotional strength. Bala is physical strength. Only by physical strength, intellectual strength and emotional strength are the three kinds of Bala.

**Key Quote:** "Devotees achieve things which is beyond their individual Jnana Bala Kriya."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the importance of skills (Kriya) and how Krishna helps devotees by providing the necessary Jnana, Bala, and Kriya, enabling them to achieve things beyond their individual capacities through faith and recognizing Krishna as the proprietor.

Then you need Jnana. Then you need Kriya. Kriya is skills, expertise. I can make it... I can type something in a typewriter by looking at A and pressing A, B, in a clumsy way. I can type something in a typewriter by looking at A and pressing A, B in a clumsy way. Whereas an expert typist, the same machine, same... I also have knowledge how typing happens. The typist also has knowledge how typist happens. But the typist has knowledge and skill. I have only knowledge. I can clumsily type. The typist can type. Knowledge and skill. So skill is required. So to achieve anything in this material world, certain skills are required. So if you don't have... If you don't have an architecture, you don't have an object. You have the person. You have the machine. You have the machine. So you have the person. architect skill, then you have, if you want to build a temple, you have to get an architect. Again, it is reconfiguring that brain. That brain somewhere else, instead of doing some other work, you give temple work to him, he will work. That's all. And then output will come. So, every challenge in the material world, every achievement challenge, you should just reduce it to reconfiguring matter. Big deal. Nothing. What is there? Just you have to reconfigure. But I need all these things, Bala, all these things. So, you have to work. And this is where Krishna helps. He gives the Bala. Whatever shot of Bala, he will give. I maintain what you have, I provide what you lack. Whatever skill you lack, I will give. So, therefore, devotees achieve things which is beyond their individual Jnana Bala Kriya. Each of us are having a corpus of Jnana Bala Kriya at different times. As we grow in life, according to what is released by Kala. And it is this we use. But then, you know, if we have faith in Krishna, that it is Krishna's work, proprietor of the work is Krishna, fruit of the work is Krishna's, miracles will happen. Jnana Bala Kriya, because Jnana Bala Kriya of the scale of Krishna will come and play there. Because you are recognizing the work is Krishna's, fruit is for Krishna, then the scale of that.

If the road is sloping, very nice. In a river you go in a boat, you want to ride against the current, very difficult. Go with the current, easy.

The only perspective the karmis have is to enjoy life in this life, enjoy your senses, enjoy the body. That is the only goal, which is completely self-centered. So they don't have a plan, they don't have a...

Of course, once or twice he said that if sankirtana spreads, then sankirtana has the power to even prevent this. But otherwise, a third world war is predicted.

We know that the more and more Harinam spreads, the more and more Prasadam spreads, the more and more the transcendental knowledge spreads in Prabhupada's books, this is the highest welfare activity.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna will run your day."
**Summary:** The best time to chant Hare Krishna is early in the morning with a fresh mind, before the day's activities begin, to have a deeper and more effective connection with Krishna, allowing Him to guide the day.

Hare Krishna Prabhu, when should one chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra? The best time to chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra is after a long sleep, when you wake up, because your mind is fresh. The reason being, a fresh mind is required. What does a fresh mind mean? Once you start your day, so many thoughts, this and that, it keeps like a guna, kala, karma will be churning inside you, and something and all will be coming in your mind. In the midst of that, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare... So one side you are mechanically chanting, the other side all this thinking is going on. So that is not a quality chanting. You are not touching, unless the shabda that you chant goes inside through your ears into the heart. Effectiveness is very less. As I said, it is a science. If you take a piece of iron and keep it near the fire, you will get a little heat. Put it inside the fire, red hot. A little far away, a little heat. So you want a little heat from Hare Krishna, or you want a full fire? Full fire means attentively, early morning, before your day's prarabdha karma starts, finish your association. Finish your association with Krishna. Krishna will run your day. Your life will become smooth. He will run your day. Externally there may be so many difficulties. External difficulty is not the measure of difficulty.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of repeatedly reminding ourselves that the holy name is not an ordinary sound vibration.

So you all are already familiar with the principles of soulful japa, which you are already, to different degrees, you have been practicing. But the basic principles need repeated reminders again and again to understand nicely that how this is not an ordinary vibration. If you don't repeatedly tell ourselves, feed into our mind, our subconscious mind, the nama tattva, the principles of nama avatara, by default we are going to think that it is an ordinary vibration. We are going to think. So, because we see, we are hearing sounds, so many sounds we are hearing. So we hear this sound also like that.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that if we don't train our minds to perceive the holy name as Krishna Himself, we won't feel reverence or respect.

That is a danger. Just like so many people saw 5000 years back when Krishna came. Oh, my god. Why? Why did he come? Why did he come? as him being one among so many persons who have moved along. Similarly, Krishna has taken incarnation, Kali Kale Naamo Rupe Krishna Avatara. He has come in the form of the holy name. So his holy name is his, himself. Avatara means himself. And if proactively we don't teach our mind to perceive this sound as Krishna in his Shabda Vigraha, all Satchidananda Shabda Vigraha, if we don't teach our mind, as soon as we chant or hear Naama, we won't feel that reverence towards him, respect towards him,

**Summary:** The speaker states that the holy name is Krishna's incarnation and that Srila Prabhupada explains how mercy flows from the name through analogies.

we will not feel. More or less, we will treat the holy name like an impersonal sound. Once in a while something you may remember, Oh Krishna is this Krishna himself. That is not enough. Once in a while is not enough. Throughout each bead, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. It is Krishna himself that obviously you don't have to repeat again and again if it is embedded in your subconscious. After several, you know, contemplation of the Naama Tattva and application of that, that means chant and hear in practice every day with the background knowledge, transcendental knowledge. Why, how, when, where, about this incarnation. For this, and with respect to how this incarnation affects us or how it is effective in changing our consciousness. How the mercy flows into our heart from this Naama. We are chanting for the mercy of Krishna. Krishna Naama is Krishna's incarnation. So how this mercy flows, that mechanism is also described by Srila Prabhupada through various analogies. So these analogies I will explain, two, three analogies, two, three of them that Prabhupada talks is something which is extremely important for us to get the right perception of what happens to us when we chant Hare Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "Chaitanya Charitamrita reveals that Krishna Naama is a Surya of Satchitananda... Existence, knowledge and bliss. It's an infinite source. Because that is Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's name is the sun of eternity, knowledge and bliss, which is the natural atmosphere for the soul.

Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Chaitanya Charitamrita reveals that Krishna Naama is a Surya of Satchitananda. Surya of Satchitananda means son of Satchitananda. What is normal son? It's a son of light and heat. Now we are talking about son of Satchitananda. Light and heat is energy. So son of Satchitananda means Sat, Chit and Ananda energy. Existence, knowledge and bliss. It's an infinite source. Because that is Krishna. Krishna is Satchitananda Vigraha, Anadhi Radhi Govinda, Sarva Karna Karna. So Krishna Naama is a Surya of Satchitananda. Krishna is Surya of Satchitananda. Krishna Naama is also Surya of Satchitananda. All that our soul seeks in this world or in the spiritual world is to be immersed in this Sat, Chit and Ananda Shakti. That is our natural atmosphere. Whereas now the soul is in the atmosphere of Asat Shakti, Achit Shakti and Nirananda Shakti. This is Maya energy. There is internal energy, spiritual energy of the Lord. Satchitananda energy. Sat means eternity. We all want eternal life. We all want eternal relationship. We all want eternal love. There is no doubt about it. But in the bodily life we never get any of these things. So soul's nature is to seek Sat. Chit, pure knowledge, pure understanding, not ignorance. And Ananda means bliss, love, loving exchanges, exchanges of loving, exchanges of pleasure. These are all very natural for the soul.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that the soul is eternally hungry in the material world and uses the analogy of iron in fire to explain how chanting affects us.

But somehow or the other even though very natural for us in this material world we are always defeated in our efforts for Satchitananda. So soul is always incomplete in this material world. Therefore it is eternally it is hungry. Never satisfied. So Krishna Nama is Surya of Satchitananda. The Surya of Satchitananda. And now Prabhupada explains how this works. When you put a piece of iron in the fire, the heat moves from the fire to the piece of iron. And gradually the piece of iron gets heated little by little. The longer it stays it gets heated and becomes red hot. The iron gets the quality of fire. At least 5 to 6 times Prabhupada has explained this phenomenon of how chanting works. So it is very important for us to remember this analogy of Prabhupada. Because from this analogy many things we understand about the phenomena of how actually Hare Krishna chanting influences us,

it affects us. Just like our soul is like the piece of iron. We have to put in the fire of Satchitananda. And then Sat Chittananda Energy Nam Nam Akari Boudha Nija Sarva Shakti What is this Shakti? Sat Shakti Chitti Shakti Ananda Shakti Nam Nam Akari Boudha Nija Sarva Shakti Tatrarthita Niyamita Smaranena Kalaha That Lord Chaitanya says the Lord has unlimited names and in each of His names He has invested all His Shakti. He has invested all this Shakti. Another example that Prabhupada gives is like the electrical wire. When electricity is not flowing through the wire it is a dead wire. When electricity flows through it you touch it, you get a shock. So in the same way we have to understand the holy name the shabda, avatara means Nam Nam Akari Boudha Nija Sarva Shakti Just like electricity is a Shakti Krishna Satchitananda Shakti is flowing in the sound you and me utter. Very important. In the sound that me and you utter all His energy is flowing. And where is this energy coming from? From the sun. Sun is Namaprabhu. Sun is Shuddha Nama. Sun is Krishna Himself. Krishna Himself in a sound form. He shines. His Shakti is. Krishna Himself shines. Krishna is Krishna Nama Himself. There is no difference between Krishna and Krishna Nama.

**Summary:** The speaker explains the concept of Shakti Avesha Nama and how associating with it cleanses the heart by replacing negative energies with positive ones.

and the person whose name it is. So that person now you understand very clearly. There is sun. There is sunlight, which is the energy of the sun. And it reflects on the let's say on the pond. You see a reflection of the sun. Similarly the sound we utter is not the Shuddha Nama now. It is the incarnation of the Shakti of the Lord. So Prabhupada explains using the word Shakti Avesha Nama. In New York in three lectures Prabhupada says he talks about he introduces his word Shakti Avesha Nama. That Nama that we utter in our conditioned state is the Nama in which which Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says I have invested all the powers. Who invests? Nama Prabhu invests. His Shuddha Nama invests. So first we associate with Shakti Avesha Nama. What happens when we associate with Shakti Avesha Nama? We are associating with the ocean of Sat Chit and Ananda energies. Because of that Chetodarpana Marjanam happens. That means cleansing the heart means what? Sat is Asat is replaced by Sat. Achit is replaced by Chit. Nirananda is replaced by Ananda. They are all energies. Sat is an energy. Asat is an energy. Chit is an energy. Achit is an energy. Ananda is an energy. Nirananda is an energy.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of hearing the holy name for transformation of the heart and soul, comparing it to putting iron in fire.

All Krishna's external energy and internal energy. Now our soul is swimming in the external energy. All the external energy. Now our soul is like the piece of iron. It has to go into the fire. Very mercifully that fire is ready to come to us. Each one of us. And enter our heart. Now it is very important. Where is the influence of Asat and Achit and Nirananda? Where is the first influence? In our heart. Three modes of material nature is acting on our consciousness in our heart. So if we want our soul to touch Sat Chit Ananda Sat Chit Ananda Shakti Avesha Nama You utter Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare Instantly The Lord is incarnating all his Shakti into it. The Surya of Sat Chit Ananda. There is no distance between There is no difference between Surya and his energy. We will come to it later. We will come to it later. There is no separation. The Shakti itself is as good as Krishna. And then when you are advanced in chanting There is no difference. Krishna himself directly is on our tongue. First His Shaktis come on our tongue so that we learn how to respect his Shaktis worship his Shaktis by proper association by hearing. If you don't hear Nama has incarnated on our tongue Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Ram Ram Ram Ram Your tongue is touching. Your tongue is your physical body. Your tongue is touching the Nama. But our transformation has to happen in our heart. How does the sound only by hearing it goes into the heart. If you don't hear

you are chanting the holy name of the Lord in vain. Vain means you are not taking full advantage. He has come for a purpose. He has come to enter your heart. And to turn your iron like soul into Sat Chit Ananda. That is his purpose. And you are not fulfilling his purpose. You chant Hare Krishna Mala one to sixteen Malas. But your mind is roaming everywhere not heard one name. Or heard accidentally. Just imagine Accidental hearing has made us devotees. Accidental hearing has made us devotees. If we hear the sixteen rounds What will happen? What will happen? What will happen? What will happen? What will happen? What will happen? What will happen to us? It will never fail. Put the iron in the fire it will get red hot. But if you put the iron in the fire once Oh I should hear Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama You are in the fire. Slowly you have forgotten and come out of the fire. Correct? Again you realize No, no, no I should hear. It goes into the fire again. Again Forget. What is forgetting? Thinking. You start thinking of different things. Thinking is the biggest enemy during japa. Any kind of thinking. Even philosophical thinking. Analyzing, thinking. No. Thinking is different. Thoughts are different. Thoughts that this is Krishna is different. How this is Krishna? That is thinking. Not full faith that this is Krishna. That is thought. The moment you think you cannot hear. So You put iron in the fire take it out, take it out, take it out Inside 100 years you do will it get red hot? Will it get red hot? You keep some water for boiling on the stove It gives 95 degrees heat. Take it out of the stove. Keep it. When it gets cold, keep it. When it gets cold, keep it. When it gets hot, keep it. When it gets cold, take it out. Does it ever boil in life?

it is this instruction of Prabhupada. And one may say the mind goes away what to do? To stay within the fire. Let us go back to the analogy. You stay in the fire. Again you come out. Or you go. There is a fire. Go near the fire. You will get little heat. Go into the fire. And come out. Still it will never become red hot. So our complete Red hot means complete self realization if you want. We have to everyday stay in the fire. We have to practice staying in the fire. For two hours. Which doesn't happen overnight. Doesn't happen overnight. But it can be done. To lock the attention on the holy name. You get the power from the holy name itself. Because mind is crazy. You need a power to hold the mind. To control the mind. Mind by default according to guna, kala and karma mind unwinding the thoughts. Different thoughts. We are never keeping quiet. We are always thinking. Kala is unwinding. Kala should stop. To stop kala is not easy. To stop the flow of time is not easy. Only Krishna can do it. That means the Shakti can come only from the nama. This is another important faith that you need. For good quality japa you can do only by the mercy of the holy name. So we have to pray to the holy name. By your mercy my attention may be locked upon your shabdha.

This has been practically demonstrated. Once in Vrindavan first time we did 108 rounds. In Vrindavan three years back. Then everybody did. At the end I asked one folk boy. He said his first time he is chanting. He completed 108 rounds. Because the shakti is coming from the nama. He simply followed that. Chant and hear exactly the same sound. This is the secret. What is the secret? Chant and hear exactly the same sound. What is the negative secret? Don't think. The culprit is thinking. Because we have so much faith in our thinking. Our life is full of thinking and solving problems. So much faith in our mind. Any problem comes, think. Condition. So in spiritual life also we think. Now I have to chant. I have to chant. I have to hear what I have chanted. Then you start thinking about hearing. Not hearing. There is a difference between thinking that I should hear and hearing. So you get stuck. I should hear.

Simply let Prabhupada talk to you. Golden command. That's why I said golden command. In obedience to Guru's instruction. How to do japa, how to do nama seva. Prabhupada has told. So that should echo in our mind. Chant and exactly hear the same sound. And then what happens when you hear? When you hear the shakti, the heart touches and you get the strength. And you never feel tired of chanting. This is the action. If you think during japa you cannot do 180 rounds. You cannot do 64 rounds. You will get tired, number one. Or it will be offensive. Because your mind will be roaming on entire life problems. And everything. And mechanically tongue will be moving. And you will be finishing everything. And the tenth offense is to be inattentive to the Lord. Why is it inattentive? Why is it be offense? Because the Lord has come for a purpose. He want to enter your heart. Allow Him to enter your heart. The only way He can enter into your heart if you allow by hearing. By hearing.

In fact because of my chitta I will be a different person. In fact because of the mercy of the holy name we are all different persons. We are different from the people who have no faith in Krishna. We are different from the people who have who wants who have no idea of going back to Godhead. We are different from the people who think they are completely their bodies and this life is everything. We are different. How have we become different? How have we become different? Why? There is a flow. There is a flow of chitta from the Nama. Therefore it is said this is not ordinary sound. Chaitanya rasa vigraha. Chaitanya living rasa vigraha full of rasa. Rasa means full of relationship. This sound is wanting relationship with us. The first relationship is to be inside and into your heart touch me and become purified. Become purified. You have to become purified if you hear. Even accidentally you hear once it has got so much effect. So imagine we very seriously worship the Nama Avatara

**Summary:** The speaker encourages listeners to have confidence that learning to hear is not difficult and emphasizes the importance of association, especially with the holy name.

So one thing we have to have confidence, faith that it is not a herculean task. Just because I did not hear for 40 years 50 years oh it is going to take another 100 years. Don't think like that. It is a trick of the mind. If you teach a wrong habit if you don't want to change it that habit will become stronger and stronger even after 50 years you will not hear. Because the mind is used to thinking japa. For you japa means by default think and japa. Think about preaching. Think about this. You cannot change it. Why because you are taught the mind. You get the point. See the danger of wrong habits. And also the power of good habits. You train your mind in 2-3 months to hearing japa. Completely everything. The experience of japa the experience of Krishna consciousness because all all changes are happening by association. Bhakti Yoga is about association. Association with the holy name, association with the deities association with Bhagavatam association. It is only by association the spiritual energy flows into our heart. Association is a secret. And the best of the association is Namavatara.

But for me now there is a difference. For me there is a difference. I can only say that I am unable to experience Krishna dancing on my tongue. But Krishna is dancing on my tongue. But I am able to experience the Shakti. Today's japa I can experience today's Shakti. If I don't do my japa properly where is my consciousness?

So by cleansing our consciousness gradually we will be able to experience. We will be able to chant.

That same Nama is there now also on our tongue when we chant. But it's like a put a rubber gloves keep it on the heater. You are touching the heater. But can you feel the heat? No. Why? In between there is rubber, insulator. But keep on touching what happens? Rubber will melt. Slowly heat will start. So in the same way even now we are touching Krishna is on our tongue. He is already. Krishna is dancing on our tongue. When we chant Krishna. We cannot feel it. We cannot simply imagine also. But we have to understand from the transcendental knowledge that all Shaktis are there. I have to do Chetodarpanam first. First stage of my relationship with the holy name is cleansing my heart. Cleansing my heart for that Krishna is shining his transcendental energies into our heart. So anyway this is little background for all of you. The key point I wanted to tell you is that the energy, enthusiasm to finish 100 rounds 200 rounds whatever rounds you want is coming from the Nama himself. How does it come from the Nama himself? By following the golden command. Chant and exactly same sound you hear.

This habit of thinking japa if you stop it is just like you know one rupee and one million rupees. One rupee is also rupee. One million is also rupee. You are thinking japa is like one rupee.

One million one million next bead, one million next bead, one million next bead. The other person is chanting one rupee, one rupee, one rupee, one rupee.

Because sometimes we tend to think that something like that big thing to achieve I should be really you know it is a very difficult thing. That also you should demolish. One command of Prabhupada following is not very difficult. He is saying you follow it because you don't think that you should follow it.

Then you will be shocked. So smooth. Tongue does not want those who chant with us 64 rounds at the end of 64 rounds after completing tongue does not want to stop chanting. You want to continue more and more and more. It is not that I feel tired when I am finishing the last set. No. Everybody who chants and hears want to go home, they continue the tongue goes on chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting. Because you have arrested your thinking. And you are touching Krishna. Thinking is a rubber gloves. Prabhupada was asked this particular question. Should we think of Krishna's pastime during japa? He said no just here. Just here. Because now our thinking is within the three modes. Krishna doesn't say I come as avathara as thought. For Prabhupada, thinking, chanting, preaching, everything is same. Because for him he has reached that absolute stage. Through any incarnation Prabhupada can touch Krishna. Prabhupada thinks of Krishna's image in the mind. It is Krishna. Prabhupada chants Krishna name. It is Krishna. When I think of Krishna's image in my mind it is not Krishna. When I chant Hare Krishna, it is Krishna. Why? Because Krishna has told is a easy way to access. The fact is that you see if my image of Krishna in my mind has to become pure. If my mind has to become pure, it is Krishna. So we should approach Krishna in the easiest merciful way in which even though you are impure even the beginner Krishna says I will come. Take advantage of the nama avathara.

Purport by Shrila Prabhupada: the words ग्रह में दिशु कर्म सुमीन in household duties, another word is also used here सर्वात्म नानु रूपाम. The purport is that a wife should not only be equal to her husband in age, character, and qualities, but must be helpful to him in his household duties. The household duty of a man is not to satisfy his sense gratification, but to remain with a wife and children and at the same time attain advancement in spiritual life.

But the holy name is so powerful that if one takes this medicine of the holy name on a daily basis, then all kinds of adjustments will happen with the bodily, mental situation and somehow engage in service of the Lord. You will see that we will be able to come out of this. We will be able to awaken our transcendental knowledge in spite of being neither here nor there, neither a proper brahmachari, neither a proper grahastha, neither a proper sanyasi. So Prabhupada always said forget all this, you are servant of Krishna, just serve Krishna. Those are all incidental. One should not pin so much faith on all those things. We have to follow those ashrama principles.

**Key Quote:** "Where there is chanting, maya cannot enter."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how chanting the Hare Krishna mantra protects devotees from the anxieties of material existence, especially in Kali Yuga, and provides a unique, sheltered environment.

At the same time, for the outside world we have to set an example, so we have to be very, very careful. Even though we know that there is nothing, there is no perfect ashrama that can be followed in the present environment. But those who chant the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, those who serve the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, because the spiritual potency comes from the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, one will be able to, in whatever ashram he is there, he will be able to easily follow those principles. Even if the environment is not there, in a sense he will be able to follow all those things. There is no difficulty for a devotee who is chanting sixteen rounds to follow the principles of any of these ashramas. Not at all difficult, because the holy name is so powerful. Chanting is so powerful. It is not that you chant Hare Krishna sixteen rounds and your material life is in a mess. It will not be like that. The chanting of Hare Krishna is so powerful that it will, in the midst of all this, just like look at the devotees in Hare Krishna hill or any of our temples. The outside world is such a big mess. And here devotees have no such thing. They are simply chanting, dancing, doing their service. Anxieties of struggle for existence is being spared for everybody in this Hare Krishna hill. How is it possible in Kali Yuga? Where will you get this luxury in Kali Yuga? Where you don't have to think about your eating, sleeping, waiting, defending. You don't have to think. You only think of serving Prabhupada, serving Prabhupada. Your whole life gets going. Nowhere, because material energy does not allow that. Maya does not allow that, because maya cannot enter when there is Sankirtana. Where there is chanting, maya cannot enter. So we keep ourselves under protection of the divine energy of the deities, of the holy name of Guru's mercy. By all these things we are actually continuously on a day to day basis we are protected and that is why we are in this particular situation.

any any other questions here so you said determination and conviction is affected by three modes what about spiritual convictions suppose we have conviction about Krishna consciousness those things are they affected by peoce not they are also affected by it ằ three modes of material nature that is a reason why our conviction is not the Why We Live Krishna consciousness Somebody Whose soul is convinced that means that So your level is convinced it takes time by Association by proper kind of a you know body coming into a certain situation body coming into a certain situation, sattvic situation, hearing the transcendental words, one gets convinced to start with. That conviction has to become conviction of the soul. That is when you become nishta. There are stages are there. So initially all the things that we exhibit, that is why it is said without getting that punya, one cannot come into Krishna consciousness. That punya Prabhupad gives, by serving Prabhupad's movement, we get that punya. Punya is connected to the body. So there is a bodily qualification coming up due to service to one's Guru. Once that comes up, then you enjoy higher values from this same body. To have a body with sattva guna is a gift. When you serve Srila Prabhupad slowly, you will come into that guna. When you come into that guna, कुना जि disadvantages have come into that guna when you hear Bhagavatam and everything then impact will be much more. So our journey is through the yantra only.

When you repeatedly contemplate on these truths, that this is the truth, your default perception has to change. You have to understand that your present perception has not come from out of akash, it has come out of your own creation in the past. It is all in the kshetra, it is in the field. The atma is kshetrajna. In your field it is created. That default perceptions are created. So that default perception, how did it get created? By repeated contemplation and application. You think and then you apply it. That means you use that.

Then that perception slowly sinks inside us. Then we have to start applying those perceptions in life. When you encounter something, then you have to apply that. And when you repeatedly apply that, that will become your default perception. Default perception. Of course. Of course. When it comes, there are different rules for managing different perceptions. For instance, Brahmacharis. Perception of females. Okay, Prabhu told in the class, I have to apply. So I have to look at every female and apply. If you try, you will finish. So for Brahmacharis, the stage of life is that, no, no, you completely avoid it. Yes. You observe in other things. Completely avoid that.

So Brahmachari is not in the process of, you know, changing perception. No. No. You are changing perception by, by the process that I said, with respect to female. To many other things, yes. With respect to holy name, contemplate, apply, contemplate, apply, contemplate, apply. Every day you are chanting. Before that, you do pre-Japa. You contemplate. While you are doing Japa, you apply, apply, apply. Your default perception of holy name will change. Your default perception of hearing. Everything.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a car and the principle of 'disuse atrophy' to explain how unused perceptions weaken and fade away, reinforcing the Brahmachari's path of detachment.

Everything will change. So where to apply this? But the secret is this. If you want to change something, this is the method. And then what? Then the question may come, then as a Brahmachari, if I am, if I have never contemplated and if I have never counted, then what will happen to me? My default perception will remain, isn't it? Same philosophy holds with the Brahmachari. Same philosophy holds with the Brahmachari. Same philosophy holds with the Brahmachari. Same philosophy holds with the Brahmachari. And he is saying, this will change, this will change. The one who doesn't have a strong mental perception, he will become a useless thing. It will be the same principle that has been passed on to anything that has never been used. He is saying, this is the entire essence of these Vedic principles. It will go away. It will weaken away, no Dhamma. If you don't use a car, even a brand new car, keep it there for 10 years, won't start, it will not start. Don't use it, it will not come.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of diabetes and insulin to illustrate how repeated contemplation and application amplify perceptions, both good and bad, emphasizing the power of the mind.

Terminology also, disuse atrophy they say. If something is not used regularly, it will die. So same thing, think it's just like in diabetics, they say, if you don't use your pancreas, instead you artificially put insulin from outside, what you are doing is you are killing it more. So finally, your increase of insulin has to go on, your dose of insulin go on increasing, they say. Same thing, think like pancreas, you got perception in your mind, it's all in your subtle body, no? If you go on using it, it becomes stronger and stronger. If you go on seeing female as enjoyable, enjoyable, enjoyable, it becomes empowered, empowered, empowered and one day you will feel, so enjoyable it is. It's all in the head. Amplify, amplify, amplify, amplify, amplify, amplify. Nothing is there outside that person who is there, maybe it's, let's say every day you say, see one female. No amplification happening in her, but you, day by day, amplification, amplification, amplification, amplification. Nothing is that, female is just walking up and down. In your head, it is amplifying. So default perception, any perception, good perception or bad perception, it is amplifying.

By repeated contemplation and repeated application, it gets strengthened. By starving it, it becomes weak and dead. So don't have to fear. The Brahmachari's method of removing what perception that you have got before joining is gone, of female, it will all just fuse off if you don't touch it for many years. That is the principle of Brahmacharya. If at all you touch it, you hear like this thin waste daughters of, a very purifying Shabda it is. Your attraction to thin waste daughters will go away, Their description of beautiful breasts in Bhagavatam, you hear that, you hear Shabda, it will go away. Female beauty is described in Bhagavatam. You hear that story of Puranjana all that thing you hear?

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Somehow or other, if one meets a saintly person completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favour, then one's life mission becomes complete."
**Summary:** This segment focuses on the importance of associating with saintly persons and receiving their favor, as highlighted in the Srimad Bhagavatam and exemplified by Srila Prabhupada's experience with his guru.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 22, Text No. 5: Tavasandarshanadeva Chinname Sarvasamchayaha Yatsvayam Bhagavanpretya Dharmamaharirakshisho. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace Shri La Prabhupada: Now I have resolved all my doubts simply by meeting you, for your lordship has very kindly and clearly explained the duty of a king who desires to protect his subjects. PURPORT BY SHRI LA PRABHUPADA: Manu described herewith the result of seeing a great saintly person. Lord Chaitanya says that one should always try to associate with saintly persons, because if one establishes a proper association with a saintly person, even for a moment, one attains all perfection. Somehow or other, if one meets a saintly person and achieves his favour, then the entire mission of one's human life is fulfilled. In our personal experience, we have actual proof of this statement of Manu. Once, we had the opportunity to meet Vishnupat Shri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj and on first sight, he requested this humble self to preach his message in the western countries. There was no preparation for this but somehow or other, he desired it and by his grace, we are now engaged in executing his order which has given us a transcendental occupation and has saved and liberated us from the occupation of material activities. Thus, it is actually a fact that if one meets a saintly person completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favour, then one's life mission becomes complete. What is not possible to achieve in thousands of lives can be achieved in one moment if there is an opportunity to meet a saintly person. It is therefore enjoined in Vedic literature that one should always try to associate with saintly persons and try to dissociate oneself from the common man because by one word of a saintly person, one can be liberated from material entanglement. A saintly person has the power because of his spiritual advancement to give immediate liberation to the conditioned soul. Here Manu admits that all his doubts are now over because Karadhamma has very kindly

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual growth happens by constant shower of mercy of the spiritual master, mercy of the deities, mercy of prasadam, mercy of great devotees like Tulsimaharani, mercy of holy rivers, mercy of holy dham."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the material paradigm of hard work guaranteeing success with the spiritual principle of advancement through receiving mercy from various transcendental sources.

Here, Srila Prabhupada in the Bhaktivedanta purports, he explains the principle of association with great saintly persons. Even a moment of association, sadhu-sangha, one can attain all perfection by achieving his favor. This is a very important principle in the process of spiritual advancement for every devotee. Normally, everything in this world is achieved. That's the paradigm of everyone, that I work hard and I have to achieve. I work hard and I have to be successful. So when we come to spiritual life also, naturally the tendency is to think that I work very hard for my sadhana, etc. and then result is guaranteed. In other words, it's like making spiritual advance, turning spiritual advancement to simply following some process. In the material world, it's like that. You go through a process, the result has to be there in the end. So we have to be very careful in our mind to change this paradigm. This paradigm has been ingrained into us through our education system. We are all victim of this. By default, our thinking is like this. It is only when you understand the principle of spiritual flow of mercy, how actually spiritual growth happens, not like how you learn in school. Spiritual growth happens by constant shower of mercy of the spiritual master, mercy of the deities, mercy of prasadam, mercy of great devotees like Tulsimaharani, mercy of holy rivers, mercy of holy dham.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that spiritual advancement is about receiving key understandings through a descending process, highlighting the permanent nature of transcendental knowledge compared to temporary material knowledge.

What is this mercy, mercy, mercy? How does it impact me? How does it impact a sadhaka? Spiritual advancement means receiving key understandings through the descending process. At least we should, even if our mind is stuck in a process-oriented thinking, turn it into it is a descending process. That today if I have some advancement, it's not because I read Prabhupada's books alone, not because I thought a lot and I understood. It is because I read Prabhupada's books and Prabhupada gave his mercy. It is because I thought about all this and Krishna in the heart gave me the realization. Realization and understanding. So everything that we have today is a combination of whatever we desire, whatever is our attitude towards the desire and what we have received from a transcendental source. All that we receive from a transcendental source, it is not temporary. It is permanent. It stays with us. In the material world, so many energies come and go. You say spiritual, if you do your PhD this life, next life that knowledge is gone. But if there is a mercy of from the transcendental source of enlightenment, that will remain with the soul even though it may get covered, but doesn't matter. It remains. It's an eternal asset for the soul.

So our business in spiritual life will be successful if we constantly collect mercy. Of course you cannot go on like plucking a flower, you cannot collect mercy. Mercy has to be begged. So the begging mode, anticipating mode is extremely important for a devotee. The devotee is constantly in the mode of begging and anticipating the mercy of the Lord in various forms. Just like we can say, okay, every day we are coming for sadhana, it is a process. 4.15 you have to be there, then samsara dava has to be sung, then Tulsi has to be, Tulsi Maharani's song has to be sung, she has to be glorified, then you go, Prabhupada Puja, etc., etc., all these processes you have to follow. So in the neophyte, a devotee thinks, this is, okay, I have to go for this, I have to go for this, this is a process. Even though externally every day it appears to be the same thing, 4.15 Mangalarati, 4.15 same song, every day same song, samsara dava, samsara dava, samsara dava, you don't get bored? 30, 40 years same song, samsara dava, you don't get bored. The fact is that we don't get bored. Why? Every day the mercy coming out of the altar to each devotee is different. Externally it is same, internally it is different. What plays in the devotee's heart, his understanding, his realization, his situation for that day, his faith, his prayers, all are different. So you don't get bored. That is a variety. So every day is different. Every day Mangalarati is different. Every day Guru Puja is different. Every day Tulasi Aarti is different.

**Key Quote:** "Ultimately the Adhikara, the qualification comes when the spiritual master is pleased...because ultimately essence of all Jnana is what? Service to the Lord."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the contamination of imbalanced effort on the jnanic path, emphasizing that true qualification and understanding come through service to the Lord and pleasing the spiritual master, not through intellectual speculation alone.

Like Prabhupada said, I can kick out Maya in one second. So we should hold on to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, beg for the mercy of the Lord. There is another kind of contamination when there is an imbalanced effort on a devotee's path, Jnanic path. You have to think, think, think. You have to cross sometimes this thinking stage. Sometimes you have to think. We all thought about it and came to Krishna consciousness. Go on thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking everything. When we have to put effort to think, then that is speculation. Thinking is not wrong, but thinking will automatically come. Thoughts will automatically come. When you struggle to think, then it is Jnana-Prayasa. Then it is Jnana-Prayasa. Unnecessary endeavor. You have a philosophical question, you think too much, you cannot answer now. Jnana-Prayasa. Wait, get the Adhikara. Get the qualification. Adhikara for the soul means enough more services to be done. You have to raise your spiritual platform. Then you will get the answer. Then you will have qualification to understand the answer. It is not that for every question that you ask, you have to get an answer now. What is the use of you getting the answer if you cannot understand the answer? So the question has to be raised, no doubt. It is our nature to raise question. But then we have to understand that ultimately the Adhikara, the qualification comes when the spiritual master is pleased, when Guru is pleased, Srila Prabhupada is pleased with the devotee who is sincerely trying to advance and who is trying to serve him because ultimately essence of all Jnana is what? Service to the Lord. Essence of all realization is what? Devotional service to the Lord.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of Srila Prabhupada's books as a readily available source of his mercy, highlighting that the problem is not the lack of availability but the lack of desire to collect it.

it is all Lord's Leela. These words of Srila Prabhupada are printed in this form. His words are captured in sound. In recorded sound. If one has faith in Srila Prabhupada, then one can continuously receive his mercy. He can receive his mercy. Transcendently receive his mercy. Anybody can receive his mercy. That is why Prabhupada always stressed, distribute my books, distribute my books, distribute my books. This is the most important thing that Prabhupada considers as his contribution to the world, are not the temples, but it is the books. Srila Prabhupada himself has considered this to be most important contribution, which is coming from the spiritual world under the order of the Guru Parampara and Krishna, that he has contributed this to this world. It is his books. His books means his words. How by Lord Krishna's arrangement everything is recorded, every lecture he gave is recorded. Nowadays it is very common. In those days in 1965 and all, it has just come into being. Record player and all, just come into being. Even videos, audios and all, few black and white and all, it has just started. All those things are captured. Just imagine, you know, we are able to carry in a small, small empathy player, 800 lectures of a pure devotee. Imagine if you hear 800 lectures nicely, what will happen to you? Nothing is happening to us because we don't hear. It is available. We don't hear. Now the problem is not availability of mercy. Nobody wants to collect.

**Summary:** This segment discusses how to be conscious of Prabhupada by perceiving his qualities, desires, aspirations, and determination, rather than just focusing on his physical form.

which is a fact. You don't have to see Prabhupada. If you read his life history, he'll touch you. You can feel him. Therefore devotees should all read Srila Prabhupada's Leelas. They should hear, and they should read Srila Prabhupada's pastimes of how from 1965, he built up this movement, till he left this planet, all the different activities that he did. When you read it, then you'll be able to, you have to perceive a person, means you have to perceive that person's desire, you have to perceive that person's aspirations, you should perceive that person's purity, you have to perceive that person's Iccha Shakti. Perceiving, those things are perceiving the person. How do, a devotee asked me, how to be conscious of Prabhupada? It's not simply his form. You get stuck there. The person can be perceived by his interest. The person can be perceived by his determination. By his personal qualities, you can perceive a person. You can pinpoint, very uniquely, who was Prabhupada, by his determination to go to America and preach, by his desire to please his spiritual master, by his aspiration to spread Lord Chaitanya's movement to everywhere, irrespective of any country. His confidence and trust that the Holy Name is powerful enough to change everyone.

**Key Quote:** "Think of the process as a transcendental process of effort and mercy."
**Summary:** This segment answers a question about attending sadhana as a process, clarifying that it should be understood as a transcendental process involving both our effort and the mercy of the Lord and Srila Prabhupada.

Generally, sadhana we attend like a process. Will it be okay, Prabhu, or anything consciously we have to make some effort? It's a process. As you understand what process means to you. If it is a two-way process, if you think it is a two-way process, that means you are doing something and Prabhupada is also doing something to you. You are doing something and Prabhupada and Krishna is doing something to you. If this perception is there, then thinking of this as a process is fine. But normally in this material world, process generally means it's you put your effort only and the result has to be there. Or even your effort, somebody, all other people's effort, it's all visible, grossly visible efforts. In the material world also, process sometimes means this way and that way, people, all those things, combination, combination of... Just like a factory produces something, they say it is a... It was a process of teamwork, they will say. But here, it's not visible like that. It's a transcendental process. That means your effort you can see, grossly. But, the other effort that, that other mercy that comes from Prabhupada and Krishna and Lord in the heart, these things cannot be seen. If you are Shrabdha, you can capture it. You know this is coming from... You feel that it is mercy. So think of the process as a transcendental process of effort and mercy. Shrama, cheshta from our side, kripa from the Lord. Kripa from transcendence, effort from our side. So,

**Summary:** This segment contrasts the Vaishnava understanding of the guru as an eternal guide with the Mayavadi perspective, emphasizing the importance of complete surrender and faith in the spiritual master.

So we think, we understand it's an eternal process. I am eternally dependent upon my guru. I go to the spiritual world also, I depend upon my guru. Here he will teach me how to be liberated from material energy, how to purify. There he will teach me how to adopt the right kind of mood to serve the Supreme Lord. Nobody can go and directly serve the Supreme Lord. You need a, there is transcendental intelligence in the spiritual world. So there are masters in the spiritual world who knows how actually to please Krishna. You cannot just go and please Krishna the way you want. So my guru is eternal guru. He is my guru in my spiritual world also. That is the reason why we make a big issue about the guru issue. He is not a joke. When you surrender to a spiritual master, it's not a joke. That surrender that being talked about, the same faith that you have in Krishna has to be in the guru. Means what? Unless one is authorized by the predecessor spiritual master, one cannot become guru. That is why Prabhupada did not authorize anybody.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes that the qualifications to be a spiritual master, including the ability to accept surrender and transparently connect disciples to Krishna, cannot be self-proclaimed but must be authorized by the predecessor guru.

According to our Siddhanta, a person accepts a spiritual master, a person is a spiritual master, he has to, you know, surrender his soul to him. Is a person capable of taking that surrender? Is a person capable of transparently passing on to Krishna? And these two processes of capability cannot be self-certified. Can never be self-certified. You cannot suddenly feel convinced that I can do it. Prabhupada is saying, I was authorized. For first sight he requested this humble self to preach the message in the western countries. There is no preparation for this, but somehow or the other he desired it. Look at this. And by His grace we are now engaged in executing His order. By His grace. Which has given us a transcendental occupation. And has saved and liberated us. Prabhupada is saying, by giving this service to me, Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur has saved me. Thus it is actually a fact that if one meets a saintly person, completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favor, then one's life becomes

**Summary:** This segment highlights the importance of sound vibration in devotional service and praises Srila Prabhupada for making the process practical and accessible, also mentioning Prabhupada's Trikalagya nature.

And actually you touched some very essential points throughout the dissertation. But the essential one was that everything is based on sound vibration. Because it's the beginning of devotional service, Shravananda. Beginning means the end. In devotional service there is not diversity. If one is encouraged in performing only one service, Ambarish Maharaj did the example, he can achieve full, the complete process. Beyond time. Yes. Because a particle of the infinite carries the infinite. In this infinite, it means devotional service is supreme. And this is what Prabhupada, as you clearly also exposed, is doing. Bringing the process in a practical and very easy accessible way. Depending on one's consciousness. This is Vyavasaya Yad Mika Budhir. Regardless of how you explain it, the amount of knowledge, scriptural knowledge, literal knowledge in that sense, literally. The person can become a scholar. But the Bhakta is above that because the process of revelation by the Lord, just . And then, I want to share with you one amazing history, just a few days ago. Before coming, Gargamuni Prabhupada told me, and had a relationship with this, that you already expertly exposed. When Prabhupada was in that period of history. Nowhere digital development was around. But somehow, this proves. It blew the body in the category of Trikalagya. Every one of us is somehow Trikalagya in many aspects. The father knows what the child is doing and, you know, seeing what he's going to do next. He is the father spiritually. It means that he spiritually is not like Krishna but is God-like.

And then, I started to use in the cities of Prabhupada in the same category because everyone knows into this, you know, MP3s and this and that. And Prabhupada had made the arrangements through these two devotees which I always, although I have some differences because that's why it's individuality, but always I praise their service to Srila Prabhupada because they introduced all this new editing of the lectures of Prabhupada putting the letters on the translation also of Prabhupada. And now, now it's going on in different languages in the world, the same process, the same mechanics, you know, Prabhupada lecture, Prabhupada giving and people listening. It's so hard in Kali Yuga, you know, people reading books and sitting and listening and falling asleep and they, and they have devised so many other techniques putting not only one, when Prabhupada, there is no video of Prabhupada speaking but there is only the song so they put the pictures and whatever is referring to keep and eventually some background of some other music. Anyway, always I am that, I mean, appreciating this amazing service of Prabhupada. Yes, technology is really something which is very much part of the spiritual movement. Prabhupada's and Gaudiya Vaishnava movement. Now, technology is very much part of it because ultimately it's all Krishna's and Sankirtana means coming together. Coming together means communication. Communication means internet. So, these are all, you know, Krishna is making the Jivas discover all these things so that the Sankirtana movement, the prediction of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu will come true that the whole world will chant Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Srila Prabhupada Khid Ass Learning Shankaracharya industrial The

Therefore the holy name first shines pure satya, chitta and ananda energy. Unlimited quantities is available. Just like Surya has got unlimited light and heat. Similarly, when Krishna descends into our heart, through our ears, just as the iron put in the fire becomes red hot, in the same way, when nama, Hare Krishna nama goes into our heart, automatically there is an energy that goes into our heart, satya, chitta and ananda energy.

It can go into our heart, through hearing. Chanting the holy name of the Lord, He is worshipping, and as you worship Him, the Lord is gifting us with His association, if you hear. So we chant, and the Lord reciprocates by entering our heart, as iron put in the fire becomes red hot, the Lord, to the extent to which we are ready to give up satya, chitta and ananda, immediately He is ready to replace it with satya, chitta and ananda. That is the reason why, along with chanting Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, Srila Prabhupada, all the Acharyas, have also instructed four regulative principles.

**Key Quote:** "Then, that is called soulful japa."
**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa explains the difference between mechanical, mindful, and soulful japa, emphasizing the importance of engaging the heart with feelings of appreciation, gratitude, and love towards the Lord.

So, before we continue with our japa yajna, I will give an orientation on doing soulful japa. Soulful japa. When you say soulful, we have our body, we have our mind, we have our soul. When you do japa, by putting our total self to chant and hear and worship the Lord's holy name, that is soulful japa. If you give only your tongue, that is mechanical japa. If you give your mind to hear the sound, that is called mindful japa. If you give your heart, along with the tongue, mind, you give your heart to chant and hear with feelings towards Nama Prabhu, feelings of appreciation, feelings of gratitude, feeling of love.

**Key Quote:** "But if you do mindful japa, you will automatically advance to heartful, soulful japa."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts mechanical and mindful japa, asserting that mindless japa is offensive and stagnates spiritual progress, while mindful japa naturally leads to soulful japa.

Then, that is called soulful japa. So, if we don't train our mind to hear what we chant, we do not even advance from mechanical japa to mindful japa. Mechanical japa to mindful japa. Mechanical japa, once you learn how to do, your tongue can finish sixteen rounds and your mind can be roaming everywhere. If you have some problem, particular problems, let's say some serious problems, that day, then you can chant sixteen rounds with your tongue. Your mind will be solving those problems, thinking of that, this, that. Or if you have some emotional showdown with someone, then that will not go away from the mind. Mind will be thinking, why did I do that, why did I, what did he do, she do, not fair, this thing, that thing, all those things because emotion comes. Doesn't stop analyzing, then gone, you are not able to hear. And if somehow or the other, we train ourselves for mindful japa, which is meaning to hear. Mindful japa means, already shabda has gone inside, through the ears. After quite some time, if you go on doing mindless japa, if you do mindless mechanical japa, that will not, there is no guarantee that you will go to the next level. Whole life you can be doing that. But if you do mindful japa, you will automatically advance to heartful, soulful japa.

**Key Quote:** "So mindful japa means, each bead, you chant in exactly the same sound you hear."
**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa explains the difference between mindful and mechanical japa, emphasizing that japa is a relationship with the Lord and highlighting Srila Prabhupada's instruction to chant in exactly the same sound you hear.

It is not that you do mechanical japa, one day you will do mindful japa. And you go on doing mindful japa, one day you will do soulful japa, after purification. No. If you do mindless japa, because mindless japa is offensive japa. You are neglecting the Lord. There is no question of, you will stagnate there. If you do mindful japa, then soulful japa will automatically rise up, when your feelings for Krishna is awakened in your heart gradually. Feelings of surrender, all those things. So in, what is the difference between mindful japa and mechanical japa? In mindful japa, mind is there. In mechanical japa, mindless, mindlessness. There is no mind at all in chanting and hearing. Automatic, mechanical. Anything you repeat, you make your body repeat, it learns. So it is, mindless japa is impersonal japa. Actually, japa is a relationship with the naam avatara. So bead after bead, every bead is a relationship with the sound incarnation of the Lord. He is before us. So mindless means, we are neglecting him. So mindful japa means, each bead, you chant in exactly the same sound you hear. And this is the diamond command of, golden command of Srila Prabhupada. Chant Hare Krishna

**Key Quote:** "So, the key to mindful japa is to ensure that you are hearing the chanting."
**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges the value of mechanical japa as a commitment but emphasizes the importance of progressing to pure devotional service through mindful japa, identifying thinking as the main obstacle to hearing the chanting.

So this mechanical japa to just finish sixteen rounds, it's okay. At least there is one commitment I have committed to my spiritual master, I should finish sixteen rounds. But Prabhupada does not want us to always remain neophytes. He wants us to learn how to offer pure devotional service. Okay, in mechanical japa, as far as Krishna is concerned, we are not even feeling his presence. At least if you feel commitment to Srila Prabhupada, I am obeying Srila Prabhupada, so that much bhakti is there, even in mechanical japa. No, no, I have not finished my rounds. Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck, you finish mechanically. There is something there. So, God will bless you and Prabhupada will bless you. But Prabhupada will not expect, Prabhupada expects you to go beyond inattentive japa So, the key to mindful japa is to ensure that you are hearing the chanting. And what is the obstacle for hearing the chanting? Thinking, thought processing. When you are thinking, within the mind you are chattering.

**Key Quote:** "Hearing is to know this sound."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that thoughts are subtle sounds that interfere with hearing the holy name, and that hearing is not just a physical act but a process of knowing the sound.

Mind and intelligence are discussing. What is thinking? You throw up, mind throws up one option. Intelligence will analyze. No, no, not that. So, permutation combination. You are going on iterating your thoughts. That is, the... Because it is a tasking activity, you are tasking something. You are tasking to solve a problem or you are tasking to understand the philosophy, all these things. When you are tasking, then your mind is involved in tasking, so it cannot hear. And thoughts are nothing but subtle sound. That means if you hear those sounds, then you cannot hear this sound. So, attentive, giving attention to knowing the sound that you are chanting, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. As each shabda, there are only three shabdas, Hare Krishna and Rama in the Mahamantra. As these shabdas, the speed with which you chant, you should catch them by hearing them and sending inside, by knowing this sound. Hearing means what? Chanting means you move your tongue. In hearing, what you do? It is knowing. It's a jnana indriya. Hearing is not a doing. Not a doing. Hearing is to know this sound. Now Hare is on my tongue, means continuously be aware, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama. To know the sound. Know the sound with feeling, with appreciation, with all the different bhavanas. So chanting is a doing.

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "If you pile up hearing over hearing, that means without any thinking in the gap...will have fantastic effect."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of stacking bricks to illustrate the power of continuous hearing without thinking, leading to an immediate and profound effect on consciousness.

Hearing is a knowing. And also a doing because you have to ensure that no other hearing is there. Only one particular knowing and a particular knowing and not any other activity should be done and tasking should be done. Mind's business, mind's task is mind's nature is to task. Every moment we are always tasking something. Stop all tasking. Task only repetition. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. You should pile up just like you know if you have a brick on your hand. You have brick on another hand. The pressure on each hand is one brick load. Suppose instead of the second brick, I put the second brick on the same hand. Third brick on the same hand. What happens? Weight is more. Weight is more, right? Similarly, if you pile up hearing over hearing, that means without any thinking in the gap, hearing over hearing over stacking, stacking one brick over the other like that. Hearing over hearing over hearing will have fantastic effect of like iron put in the fire, becomes red hot. Our consciousness, you can immediately, immediate effect it is. Sometimes people say, like Hare Krishna chanting, you are not able to give people any immediate feeling effect. Just like somebody gives some some yogic process, so immediately they are feeling some peace, immediately something. Here also, because we don't teach people to hear, that is why they don't get immediate effect. If you teach them how to stack up and chant, even a new person, first time chanting, if he does that without thinking, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, he will be shocked. He will get such an experience that he would want to chant every day.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The sound name of Krishna is very merciful, so therefore, Krishna himself is there, but it's in the name form."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that soulful japa allows one to touch Krishna's sound incarnation, leading to purification and the revelation of Krishna's various aspects, explaining that the holy name is Chinmaya Shabda, or conscious sound.

And by such soulful japa, you are, you are touching the holy name, touching Krishna's sound incarnation. Krishna, who is before us is Krishna, himself is before us. If you want Krishna's form before us, you need to qualify so much. The sound name of Krishna is very merciful, so therefore, Krishna himself is there, but it's in the name form. So in the name form, if we worship, slowly we get purified, then we even see all other aspects of Krishna. Krishna is not only name aspect, Krishna has form aspect, Krishna has got quality aspect, Krishna has got past time aspect, they are all Krishna. All that will be revealed from the, by Nama Prabhu. Why we call this Nama, Nama Prabhu? Because this sound is Chinmaya Shabda. There is Chinmaya Shabda and there is Jada Shabda. All the Shabdas in this world are Jada Shabda. There is no person involved in that sound. But when it comes to sound that let's say Prabhupada speaks, it's Chinmaya Shabda. Today you hear Prabhupada's lecture, Prabhupada is not separated from that. Eternally, he himself is speaking. Anytime you hear him, he is speaking as he gave the lecture, when he was sitting and giving lecture pre-1977. It is all Chinmaya Shabda. Bhagavad Gita, Krishna spoke, it's Chinmaya Shabda. Krishna's name is Chinmaya Shabda. Chinmaya, in normal thing you can say, it's conscious sound. But whose consciousness is it? Krishna's name is Krishna's consciousness.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Krishna himself is sounding."
**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of having Shraddha (faith) that Krishna himself is present in the sound of the holy name, leading to jubilant hearing and delightful chanting.

So this is a very primary understanding that should have Shraddha. Shraddha that this is Krishna himself coming in the sound form. Krishna himself is sounding. Now I am sounding this if you take sounding as a verb, I am sounding this sound. I am sounding, therefore this sound is coming out. So in japa, we are actually chanting. Our tongue is chanting. But actually Krishna is mercifully, he is sounding it. That is why in some people's tongue, Krishna Nama does not come because of their offense. So here we are chanting in service of the Nama and Krishna is also sounding. Krishna sounding and Krishna is no different. So we have to always have minimum Shraddha that this is Krishna himself. Roopa Krishna is Purna Krishna. Commonly we understand, okay, okay, okay, now only sound has come. But I saw Krishna. That you feel more complete. This is our conditioning. As much Purna the Roopa Krishna is, that much Purna is Shabda Krishna. We are, we are invoking Shabda Krishna. We are associating with Shabda Krishna. It's Krishna himself. So fortunate. Because if you have that Shraddha, then automatically you will be jubilant in hearing, in jubilant in embracing each sound. You will be delightfully chanting, oh my god, just chanting means Krishna is appearing on my tongue. How much delightful I should be. So one should delightfully chant, joyfully hear. When you realize that Krishna has come on my tongue, on my tongue, my god, himself has come on my tongue to give me association.

**Key Quote:** "Doing japa is not only I am chanting, Lord himself is, he is sounding that."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that doing japa is not only chanting but also the Lord sounding the holy name, leading to feelings of priti (love), and that Krishna receives the seva (service) offered through Shakti Avesha Nama as if it were offered directly to Him.

Automatically you will feel his priti. I am such a insignificant soul. I have got this chance to do japa. As I said, doing japa is not only I am chanting, Lord himself is, he is sounding that. Sound that we chant and the nama from the Lord, he enters, Avesha. What enters? The transcendental sound enters. Just like in a marble deity or something. Marble deity is made of matter. But, Sachidananda Lord enters. So similarly, the Lord enters in the shabda that we make, that we chant and then it becomes transcendental sound. Shakti Avesha Nama. Shakti Avesha Nama is what we and Krishna says, Krishna, the principle is that, if Shuddha Nama had come before you, if you chant and serve, you glorify by singing Hare Krishna, Krishna Nama, Shuddha Nama. How he receives your seva, the same way Krishna is receiving exactly just by Shakti Avesha Nama, by serving the sound that you hear audibly with your ears. Krishna gives you the credit for chanting and hearing his Shuddha Nama. Just like how Krishna, you offer a garland to the deity. You are offering the garland to the deity, but the Sachidananda, it is as good as, because Krishna has decided, I will become this.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the need for faith that the sound of the holy name is Chinmaya (spiritual), Krishna's sound body, and that one should approach chanting with seriousness, recognizing its importance.

That faith is required. I offer garland to the visible deity, the deity visible with my eyes. And what is Krishna's promise? I will take that as you are offering to me, Sachidananda in the spiritual world. That is where faith is required, that this is not just the ordinary sound that I am hearing with my ears, but it is a Chinmaya sound. The spirit part of it you don't see, but you will start experiencing. Just like I see your body, but I don't see a spirit. But I still see though, this is, there is a person in this body. And this is Krishna's sound body, Shabdavatara, sound body. In that sound body, Krishna's transcendental sound is a transcendental soul in the sound. So, rapid progress you make in realizing Krishna consciousness, different aspects of Krishna consciousness, if you start with serious mindful japa, and then gradually it will awaken our and plus when you are reading Prabhupada's book, all those things, then in soulful japa, you can start doing soulful japa. Now itself, because we are devotees of the Lord, so much of Prabhupada's books we have studied, it's not that now we can only do mindful japa, we can also do soulful japa immediately. The feeling of surrender, all those things is already there. On each bead, the Lord is appearing. On each bead, each bead of Saiva is most important. One should think that it is the most important thing you can do in your life, is to add one more chanting and hearing to the history, to your history. That kind of seriousness should be there.

When you are chanting and you have this bhavanas, then Nama is called Nama Chintamani. He will fulfill our desires. And what is our desire is to do better and better japa. What is our desire is to let me feel Krishna himself. Let me… I know theoretically, philosophically, I know this is Krishna. But I beg for your costless mercy to make me feel exactly Krishna. Just like I am sitting with another person, how realistically I feel this is another person sitting before me. When will I feel like that? Krishna can make us, give us that experience. Kripa Apeksha. All kinds of mercy Nama Prabhu can give. Nama Prabhu can give us detachment from this stupid illusory love, illusory pleasures. He can give Divya Gyan, Nama Prabhu.

But all the forms are identical with one another. This is difficult for us to conceive, that there is one person with many forms, all simultaneously existing and all identical with each other. The same person, but he is present as Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Krishna, Matsya.

All identical, one Supreme Lord, but he is present in many different forms. This is actually an opulence of the Lord, that you cannot limit him to just one form. Neither he becomes split personality when he expands or when he is present in many forms. He is still the same person, still the same Supreme Lord. His qualities or his activities or his powers do not reduce when he expands, when he is present in many forms. And these forms are not temporary forms, they are all eternal forms.

**Key Quote:** "So what we should do is, we should simply hear on the authority of the Sriman Bhagavatam, on the authority of the great devotees, on the authority of the Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, to simply hear."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of hearing from authoritative sources to understand the transcendental form of God, using the example of Brahma doubting Krishna's form as a cowherd boy.

So we cannot understand, in our present condition, what is the actual nature of this form of God. So what we should do is, we should simply hear on the authority of the Sriman Bhagavatam, on the authority of the great devotees, on the authority of the Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, to simply hear. And while hearing, we try to keep aside all our material conceptions. Material conceptions of the form means, a form is a limitation. Transcendental form means there is no limitation. Transcendental form is the body. There is no limitation. So the form actually has got unlimited power, unlimited varieties, unlimited love, unlimited qualities. But still, the form is something which, when it is revealed, it becomes known to the devotee and it may appear like an ordinary form. Just like the form of Krishna. Now Krishna appears in Vrindavan like a cowherd boy. So, people may think, is this a form of God? Cowherd boy? Even big big devatas, including Brahma, they will doubt whether this is the form of God or it is the form of somebody else.

**Key Quote:** "So that is Brahma's mystic power."
**Summary:** The speaker describes Brahma's mystic power, including the example of reconstructing Hiranyakashipu's body and granting him boons, setting the stage for Brahma's attempt to test Krishna.

So Brahma knew that actually that form of Krishna as cowherd boy is actually God's form. But still he wanted to test. So he performed one trick. He used his mystic power. Brahma's mystic power is among the greatest in this material world. So Brahma used his mystic power. What is the power of Brahma's mystic power? Any example you can think of? Brahma demonstrates his mystic power sometimes. No example you can think of. Of course, while testing Krishna, he used his mystic power. That you all know. But any other example? When Hiranyakashipu was doing tapasya, what did Brahma come and do? He sprinkled some water. Hiranyakashipu's body was eaten away by ants. It was reduced to bones. The skin, the flesh, everything was finished. Just he sprinkled some water and Hiranyakashipu's body became fully reconstructed. Full luster. So that is Brahma's mystic power. That is Brahma's mystic power. So Brahma gave Hiranyakashipu the boon that you will not die in the day or night. You cannot be killed by human. You cannot be killed by devata. You cannot be killed by asura. You cannot be killed by any insect or reptile or animal. So Hiranyakashipu became very, very, very, very powerful. So that is Brahma's mystic power. That is Brahma's mystic power. He is very, very powerful.

**Key Quote:** "Brahma came a second time and took away the covered boys."
**Summary:** The speaker narrates the story of Brahma using his mystic power to steal the calves and cowherd boys while Krishna is having lunch, and Krishna's seemingly nonchalant response.

That Brahma is trying to see who is his covered body. Trying to test who is his covered body. So what did he do? What did Brahma do to test Krishna? First he took away the karmas, which Krishna had brought for grazing. Along with the karmas he also brought karmas for grazing. And they were a big number. They were not small numbers. Very big number. Number is not mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. They were a very big number. In Jetani Jetanatha I have made an idea of number. I will tell that later. So Brahma used his mystic power. And while Krishna was enjoying his lunch with the other covered boys, that time Brahma took away the karmas. He stole them. And suddenly one of the covered boys is seeing, Oh, the karmas are not there. Where has it gone? Not even one is visible. So they all started dying. So Krishna knows what is happening. But just to play along with Brahma, Krishna said, told the covered boys, Don't worry. You continue eating your lunch. I will just go look around and bring them back. They just strayed away. This is gone away. Looking for some fresh grass here and there. This is gone away. So Krishna went away, apparently in searching the karmas. Meantime, when Krishna had gone away, Brahma came a second time and took away the covered boys. What did Brahma do? He put those karmas into a sleeping condition and took them away. Next he put the boys into a sleeping condition and took them away. And he is hiding them and coming back and seeing what is happening.

#### Brahma's mystic power, Krishna's unlimited power, comparison with yogi's power

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "So you can imagine how powerful is Brahma."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Brahma's mystic power with the limited power of a yogi, highlighting that a yogi's expanded forms act in unison, unlike Krishna's independent forms.

So you can imagine how powerful is Brahma. Brahma's mystic power. So powerful. He can put them to sleep and hide them and touch a big number. Never a very big number. Not a small number. He is coming back and seeing all the covered boys and the karmas are as they are in Krishna. So Brahma is giving them away. He is using his mystic power to test Krishna. Brahma is giving them away. And he is trying to see whether the covered boys and karmas are the same or they are different. And Brahma is seeing they are the same, identical. So then he thought for a moment that Krishna has somehow done some other used some other mystic power and brought them back from where Brahma had hidden them. But actually Brahma could see that there are two sets. Not one set. Two sets of covered boys and karmas. All identical. So he has hidden them. They are there. And here Krishna is also hiding. So how is this possible? Brahma is thinking how is it possible? And not only that because a yogi can expand himself into some other forms up to nine or ten forms. And all forms will look identical to the yogi. But the yogi's mystic power is such that if in one form he lifts his hand all the nine forms the hand will lift it. It's like television screen. There are multiple screens. In the studio like telecast is going on in the studio one actor's person is lifting the hand. In the television screen same action will happen. Correct? All the television screens same action will happen. No independence. Similarly yogi when he expands all the forms will be doing the same action. These are the children they call for independence they march the drill. Everybody will do like this. Like this. Like this. The drill master will keep like this. One, two, three, four. Something like this. They all lift their hands. Correct? Identically. Looks very nice. So like that a yogi cannot independently do different things in different forms.

**Key Quote:** "Krishna when he expands his forms need not look identical... And each form can act independently."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna's forms can be different and act independently, unlike a yogi's, leading Brahma to realize Krishna's true nature as Yogeshwara.

Not possible. Krishna when he expands his forms need not look identical. His forms can look all different. And each form can act independently. So the cowherd boys are playing with Krishna. The cows are there grazing on the field in the forest and they are all independently doing their own thing. Not all are same action. No. So they are Brahma realists. No. This is not the power of a yogi that this cowherd boy is displaying. He is actually my master. Yogeshwara Krishna. He is Yogeshwara Krishna master. So he is able to display this power which is not possible for any yogi. It's not possible even for me. So he is Krishna. He is God. So Brahma would understand that here is God after testing using his own instinct. So that's the nature of Krishna's form. He can expand and each form can be different and each form can act independently and all forms are actually Krishna only. Now to prove to Brahma that these are forms of Krishna's own forms what happened? After some time Brahma was watching. Krishna turned into four handed Narayana form. All the cowherd boys and calves became four handed Narayana form. And that is when Brahma got the confirmation Oh! Krishna has expanded. While I am hiding the cowherd boys and calves in my place Krishna has expanded. So from this we can understand Krishna's form.

#### Krishna's universal form, Arjuna's vision, ordinary perception of Krishna

**Key Quote:** "One of the forms of Krishna whole universe itself."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses Krishna's universal form shown to Arjuna and how most people perceive Krishna's form as ordinary, similar to Brahma's initial perception.

What is Krishna's form? Some idea we can get. Even when Krishna showed universal form to Arjuna Bhagavad Gita has a description. You should read that description. The whole universe entire universe is actually one of the forms of Krishna. One of the forms of Krishna whole universe itself. So that form Arjuna could see sitting in one place because the universe is so big. How can you see the whole universe sitting in one place? Sitting on the chariot Arjuna was able to see the universal form of Krishna. So for that Krishna had given special vision and Krishna helped Arjuna to see that form. Arjuna could see that universal form. Then Krishna showed Arjuna that universal form transformed into four handed form. Dharayana form. Then again that four handed form transformed into Krishna's own form two handed form. So all these forms Arjuna was able to see because Krishna has unlimited forms and he is the same person and all these forms are Krishna's forms only. All these forms are Krishna's forms only. Now when somebody sees the form of Krishna generally a person who sees the form of Krishna thinks that this form is an unlimited form. Just like when Krishna was present 5000 years ago. Like Brahma thought he is an ordinary cardboard boy. Not only Brahma practically everybody used to take that form of Krishna as an ordinary form. Very few people knew that this form of Krishna is actually the form of God or Krishna is God.

**Key Quote:** "When Vishnu or Krishna out of their mercy they reveal to Brahma they reveal to a devotee they give the realization about the transcendental nature of Brahma."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that realizing Krishna's transcendental form requires devotion and Krishna's mercy, emphasizing the importance of a personal relationship.

Very few people knew that. Most people did not know that. So even if you see Krishna's form even if you see God's form you will see the way you are seeing here of Krishna and Dharna. Being a Krishna and Dharna what do people think? Statue made of metal. They think it is a statue made of metal and devotees have never heard of it. The statue. But this is not a statue. It is actually Sakshat Bhagwan Krishna. Now how can we understand how can we realize this form actually is not a statue. The same way how Brahma can realize the form of Krishna or Krishna. It is not an ordinary form. How Brahma can realize? When Krishna gives the realization out of Krishna's own mercy. When Vishnu or Krishna out of their mercy they reveal to Brahma they reveal to a devotee they give the realization about the transcendental nature of Brahma. Then only it is possible otherwise not possible. So if you also want to see Krishna or you want to realize this form as spiritual form you should actually become a devotee. You should practice Bhakti and that Bhakti should be such that you should please Krishna by your devotion. There is a certain amount of personal relationship involved in this. Personal relationship.

**Key Quote:** "It is love."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of a mother's love for her child to illustrate the selfless devotion a devotee has for Krishna, emphasizing the reciprocal relationship.

It is like in ordinary beings also we try to please a person. Especially mother tries to please the child or husband tries to please the wife. Right? It is more than just simply some activity or some relationship. It is more than that. So what is that special thing about trying to please another person? It is love. That is what we call love. So if there is love a loving relationship in which one is trying to please the other then there is possibility that the other person will reciprocate. And in that reciprocation there is no consideration of who is greater who is smaller who is demanding what. There is no such consideration. There is no calculation being done. There is no mother loves her child. The mother will take care of the child. The child will pass through a neuron. The mother will not think why I should clean? Stupid child. There is no business. Whole day only eating, sleeping, passing urine, passing stool. That's all. What does the child do whole day? Especially small child. Put him there. What does he do? Only do this business. Mother keeps on. Never counts how many times I have done. How long I have to do this. Mother never thinks. So, like that Prabhupada explains when a devotee develops love for Krishna in a loving relationship devotee is prepared to do anything for Krishna in order to please Krishna. And Krishna reciprocally is ready to do anything for a devotee to please the devotee.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that realizing Krishna's transcendental nature requires establishing a loving relationship and pleasing Him, referencing Brahma's tapasya and the importance of the parampara system.

That is Krishna. So, if you want actually to realize Krishna's transcendental form or His qualities or His color or His activities anything about Krishna about Krishna about the transcendental personality of Godhead then you have to establish a relationship that is called madhi and in that relationship you should try to please Him. Now, Brahma has pleased Vishnu by performing tapasya. He has pleased Vishnu by performing tapasya. That direction for doing tapasya was given by Vishnu himself. The beginning Brahma did not know who He is where has He come from what is the purpose of His existence He didn't know anything. So, He was directed by Vishnu to perform His tapasya and He did that tapasya very very very long time very severe and then when Vishnu was pleased then Vishnu gave Him the realization and Brahma became realized and Brahma became realized so that knowledge Brahma got the realization by the mercy of Vishnu after Brahma performed tapasya then Brahma actually got the power the knowledge the skill yana bala priya everything to create this whole universe and Brahma also got the knowledge Brahma also after creating He handed down that knowledge that is called parampara system of receiving this transcendental knowledge especially this knowledge about the personality of God especially this knowledge also the other knowledge all other knowledge but especially this transcendental and for receiving the personality of Godhead there is no other way other than receiving this knowledge in parampara system.

And after receiving this knowledge to realize this knowledge you have to follow the same technique or process Brahma what did Brahma do he tried to please Vishnu by following Vishnu's directions instructions so similarly we should first receive this knowledge and that's what all of you are doing now you are hearing you are receiving the knowledge this is parampara Shukadeva Goswami is describing he heard from Vyasa Vyasa is describing he heard from Narada Narada is describing the knowledge of Vishnu he got a direct realization through mechanical reality he heard from Vishnu where is hearing he directly got the realization what does it once say power of me namely my form my existence my color my qualities my activities that all Brahma Brahma did not first hear then I had to sit down to tapasya then after that after tapasya Vishnu would be pleased then Vishnu would give me realization no before tapasya Brahma did not know anything there was nobody to explain to him there is it is different from material form now you are all hearing like that Brahma never got a chance to hear like that directly Vishnu gave him realization so hearing and realization simultaneously happened Vishnu is speaking Brahma is hearing ok but realization is simultaneous with the hearing here is one secret you may get this knowledge by hearing or by studying and then follow a process of bhakti and then after many many many years you can get realization when Vishnu is speaking or Krishna is speaking there is another secret that simultaneously with hearing you can also get realization without following the process of tapasya and Brahma did.

Provided you are hearing these is with bhakti if you are hearing is with faith is with devotion is with bhakti devotional hearing then the realization will come along with the process separately you don't have to do anything so the bhagavata process is particularly this process of realization simply by hearing but there is a technique of hearing this hearing is not like ordinary hearing ordinary hearing work is what when you hear some information is there that information you receive and then you try to conceive that in your mind or think about it or conceptualize it understand it and then you try to put it into practice you follow some process some instruction you may have doubts you may have difficulties you may have obstacles and then you have to do so many things isn't it but that is not a process that bhagavata is actually teaching Parikshit Maharaj what did he do simply he sat and heard Shukadeva Goswami he realized Shukadeva Goswami what did he do simply he sat and heard from Vyasa Deva he realized Shukadeva Goswami what did he do he simply sat and heard from Shukadeva Goswami he realized so bhagavata process is different bhagavata process is different because in this way very quickly you can actually realize bhagavata very very quickly Shukadeva Goswami says one moment is enough one moment is enough if you follow this process of bhagavata process it is called bhagavata dharma Prahlad Maharaj described this process as bhagavata dharma right he described this in the seventh canto Shravanam Kirtanam Vishno Smaranam Pada Sevanam Archanam Vandanam Dasyam Sakhyam Atma Nivedanam this is called bhagavata dharma.

I think Shri Krishna Goswami realized Brahma before. But still, he attained perfection by speaking. The Bhagavad Gita, the Parishad Maharaj has. Who is famous for having realized Krishna by remembering? Prahlad Maharaj, simply by remembering he realized God. Then, serving the Lotus Feet, Lakshmi. Lakshmi is always engaged in serving the Lotus Feet of the Supreme God. But her realization of God came about by the same method, same process. Simply by... Serving the Lotus Feet of the Lord with devotion.

**Summary:** The speaker continues with examples of devotees who realized God through different processes of devotional service, highlighting Hanuman's service and emphasizing that hearing is the easiest process as it requires no qualification.

Then, Shravanam Keetanam, Vandanaam. Vandanaam means offering prayers. Who realized God by offering prayers? Akruda. Simply he offered prayers to Krishna. And he realized Krishna. Dasyam. Dasyam. Hanuman. Simply by acting as the Lord's servant. Lord Ram is known as servant. There are so many Masters who are servants. But that type of servant is not going to help you. Because they are not rendering service. They are not rendering service with devotion. In this world, so many Masters and so many servants. Some of them say, oh, very faithful servant. But still, it is not having devotion. So with devotion, how to serve? As a servant of the Lord, of Krishna, the Supreme Lord. That you have to learn from Hanuman. How to hear? You have to learn from Parishad. How to serve the lotus feet? You have to learn from Prajnini. So like this, Bhagavatam process especially is expressed in the Bhagavatam. You should hear the devotion. All the things here is the easiest. Other things are not so easy. Remembering, serving the lotus feet, acting as the servant of the Lord like Hanuman did. All that, not easy. Hearing is the easiest. It doesn't require any qualification.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates that hearing requires no qualification and shares an anecdote about Prabhupada reciting the tenth canto of Bhagavatam, emphasizing the spiritual benefit of hearing even without understanding.

The special thing about hearing is, it doesn't require any qualification. Will I read? Anything else requires qualification. You have to speak, or you have to serve the lotus feet, or you have to remember. It requires qualification. Whereas hearing is the only thing among the nine processes that does not require any qualification. But there is a quality to the hearing. The technique of hearing. And for that Bhagavatam says, even the technique of hearing, you develop by hearing only. Simply sit and hear, that's all. In the early days, Prabhupada was travelling. You forgot to put in the belt. Okay, two hours. I'll come close with this example. Prabhupada was travelling with some disciples. And it was Janmashtami. Early days. They were not observing him. Because the temple had not yet been started. So Prabhupada told the disciples, some few devotees, You simply hear, I will recite the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam, which describes specially the birth of Krishna. Because today is the Janmashtami, the birthday of Krishna, appearance and worship. So they were all hearing. They can't understand anything. Prabhupada is reading his answer. Prabhupada said, whether you understand or don't understand, simply by hearing, you get full spiritual benefit. You get full spiritual benefit. So, hearing doesn't require any qualification. You simply have to lend your ear. That's all. And whether you understand or don't understand, the spiritual benefit is there. And, in the beginning, maybe you don't understand. But as you go on hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, everything will be understood. Everything will be revealed. Everything will be realized. It's just a question of time.

**Key Quote:** "When you hear, don't speculate."
**Summary:** The speaker warns against speculation and material conceptions while hearing, emphasizing the importance of hearing without trying to conceive or compare, to facilitate realization.

Keep hearing. But, there is a warning given in the Bhagavatam. When you hear, don't speculate. Don't try to conceive within your material mind what is being described. Just like if it is described, Krishna is black complexion, dark complexion. Immediately, material world conception of dark is not beautiful. Material world, somebody's dark complexion, we say, generally, not beautiful. But, spiritual conception of beauty is different. It is not dependent on the color of the skin or the complexion of the body. As Prabhupada says here, some of the forms are blackish, some are whitish, some are reddish, some are yellowish. All of them are beautiful. All of them are supremely beautiful. So, that is spiritual complexion. It has no relationship with beauty. Immediately, certain complexion is same. Beautiful certain complexion is same, not beautiful. Spiritually, there is no such thing as not beautiful. All spiritual forms are beautiful. All spiritual forms are beautiful. Though there are different complexions. So, you should not speculate about the spiritual subject matter or what is being described. Simply hear as it is. And try to perceive this knowledge or hear without trying to conceive, without trying to speculate, without trying to guess, without trying to think what it could be like that we imagine. Don't hear. Don't speculate. Don't theorize. Don't compare. You can think materially. Now, the moment you hear something, you compare materially what it could be. All it will be experienced. So, this sort of hearing will actually help you to realize. So, let's stop here.

**Key Quote:** "So these are inescapable realities of life and so it's important that we reflect on it as spiritualists."
**Summary:** Lord Kapila's instructions to his mother focus on the miseries of old age, birth, and death, emphasizing the importance of reflecting on these realities as spiritualists.

knowing that is considered to be a glorious death, but an attached family man wants his family members to carry him in a great procession even after his death, and although he will not be able to see how the procession goes, he still desires that his body be taken gorgeously in procession. Thus, he is happy without even knowing where he has to go when he leaves his body for the next life. So we are seeing in this chapter Lord Kapila's instructions to his mother, and particularly in great detail we are hearing about the miseries of old age. Generally, we know birth, death, old age, and disease are the miseries, but here in this chapter of the Bhagavatam, in this section of the Bhagavatam, the miseries of old age are being more explicitly, more clearly described so that we as human beings can reflect on this and can derive great lessons from this. Similarly, there are other parts of the Bhagavatam which describe the miseries of birth, and there are other sections which talk about the miseries of death. So these are inescapable realities of life, and so it's important that we reflect on it as spiritualists, and in today's verse, Lord Kapila is saying.

**Key Quote:** "It is that strong sense of attraction I want to go back I'll be I'll going back to the Association of that my family my beloved that actually drowns away the miseries."
**Summary:** An analogy of a man returning to his family or a boy meeting his girlfriend illustrates how strong attraction can overshadow life's miseries, mirroring the attraction devotees should cultivate for Krishna.

and it's a two-day journey, and when he is coming back, the two-day journey in the train, maybe he didn't get the right seat, dirty train, all dirty people around or whatever, didn't get good food. But Prabhupada explains the thought of the joy of being united with the family is so strong that he is just thinking, "When am I going to be with my family members?" And he's so eager to be back with the family, and that joy fills those two days of his journey, and the miseries he goes through are actually not at all disturbing him. Recently, I was preaching to somebody, and I gave this example to them, and then I gave a little twist to it to make it even more, you know, for people to understand a little bit strongly. I said, "Imagine here is a boy, young boy, and after a long time he's coming back and he's going to meet his girlfriend or something whom he loves so much, and two days of journey he's absorbed in, 'When I'm going to be with her?'" And so the difficulties that he goes through in the two days, he just doesn't bother at all. When I told this to this man, he's a respected man, he immediately, about 50 year old man, he said, "Yes, yes, Swamiji, I can understand what you are saying. About 30 years back," and he started recalling, "I had to travel from Dehradun to Patna, and there was no train, and three days I had to go and then I was meeting," and she pointed to his wife who was there sitting next to him, and I was saying, "Stop, you guy." Everybody indicated that he had more questions about what you are saying about happening. I'm not a university student in Delhi days. I had to go and then I was meeting, and she pointed to his wife who was there sitting next to him, and I was engaged to her. I was going to meet her, meet my fiance, and with great difficulty I went this way, that way, bus and car train and unreserved, but I was so, I didn't bother at all. I was going to meet like that. So actually, this example of a man returning to the family or a young boy absorbed in the thought of meeting his girlfriend and wanting to be with her, this example that Sheila Prabhupada gives has one very important element in this, that is a sense of very strong attraction for the family or for the beloved. It is that strong sense of attraction, "I want to go back, I'll be, I'll going back to the association of that, my family, my beloved," that actually drowns away the miseries of the journey. The same way, Krishna deity is teaching us that our lives' miseries will become facial makeup, drowned and become insignificant, provided we have developed that kind of attraction for Krishna. I'm ready enough feeling of growing homes in the village of 17 idea Schönfeldgel beonden.

**Key Quote:** "The most important principle of the material world is the attraction between man and woman and the most important principle or the dominant principle in the spiritual world is attraction between the living entity and Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts material and spiritual attraction, stating that while attraction between man and woman drives the material world, attraction to Krishna is the dominant force in the spiritual world, making life interesting and dynamic.

me one day and he said, "Swamiji, we are opening a new house and my wife is saying that we should call you to come and do a pooja." I said, "Okay." And his wife, I could hear over here, his wife also speaking behind him, and then, "Swamiji, my wife is asking how long the pooja will be?" So I said, "Maybe one hour," I said. Then he immediately said, "Swamiji, one hour, that's too long, can you make it short?" I said, "Okay, we can make it short, shall we make it half an hour?" "No, no, no, Swamiji, even half an hour is too long, can you make it 15 minutes?" I said, "Finally, okay, 15 minutes." Soon after the call, he said, "Swamiji, I'll talk to you, I'll talk to you later on. Now there's India Pakistan cricket is going on match, I'll talk more details later on, Swamiji," and put the phone down. So see the contrast here, when it comes to a spiritual or a religious program, there's no attraction at all. He wants it to be as short as possible, one hour, my God, make it as short as possible, and the attraction is for some cricket match that's going on and see that. So it's the attraction that drives a person. There is one great statement that Sheila Prabhupada makes in a letter to one devotee. Prabhupada says, "The most important principle of the material world is the attraction between man and woman, and the most important principle or the dominant principle in the spiritual world is attraction between the living entity and Krishna." What is special about this statement of Sheila Prabhupada is actually what makes life interesting is that attraction. If there is no attraction, life becomes dull. So Prabhupada's teaching, Vedic literatures are offering, there is a life of attraction in the spiritual world between the living entity and Krishna. The attraction between a man and a woman in the material world is contrived, is वीट नहीं है , रूल रु कोट या वड़करण और अयस्कमोयों का बूर्ण के समय । यदि ये ये तो कर्मिल में एकलोरिसम है, तो ये अवश्य हो रहा है। ये खरल को रख भूलेगर वाले है, माया पर प्रतीश रूकेते हैं। ये खरल को रख भूलेगर है. Whereas in the spiritual world, the dominant force that is acting everywhere in the spiritual world is dynamic, moment to moment attraction between the living entities and the Lord. The living entities want to serve the Lord and please him, and the Lord wanting to serve the devotees and please them. Gopi jana vallabha giri varadhari Krishna is also thinking, "How I can please the gopis? How can I can please Mother Yashoda?" So the element of attraction, which is actually the spice of life, which is actually what makes life interesting, is not absent in the spiritual world.

**Key Quote:** "Spiritual life is not just mechanical repetitive not just mechanical, repetitive, mindless rituals and you go on doing that. No. It is meant, it is required that is very essential to control the senses, to purify the senses, to purify the consciousness."
**Summary:** Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings emphasize that spiritual life is not merely mechanical rituals but a process of purifying the heart to awaken the soul's original attraction to Krishna, which is facilitated by faith in Vaishnavas.

So in Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's teachings, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu points out that the Vedic processes that are mentioned are, it's called the sadhana, sadhana bhakti, vaidhi bhakti, according to the regulative principles given in the Vedic literature, that when we do that, we, our heart gets purified and that original attraction the site soul has for Krishna is awaken, then the spiritual life looks completely different. This is a very, very special hope and revelation of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as it is there in the Vedic literature. So big control over spirituality, spiritual life is not just mechanical, repetitive, not just mechanical, repetitive, mindless rituals and you go on doing that. No. It is meant, it is required, that is very essential to control the senses, to purify the senses, to purify the consciousness. But when we do that, by the mercy of Guru and Krishna, that attraction to Krishna is awakened. That is the special thing of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, it is there in the Vedic literatures but even the previous Acharyas had not as clearly pointed out, revealed as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu reveals and it is said Chaitanya Charitamruta reveals that there are certain things which are very beneficial to awaken that attraction and one important principle that is very essential to awaken that attraction is faith in the Vaishnavas because that has to be given by a Vaishnava. We cannot acquire it and achieve it. We cannot acquire it and achieve it. We cannot acquire it and achieve it by our efforts. Our efforts are a qualification to receive, but you have to receive it. If it is not given, you cannot do anything about it. You have to wait and try to please a Vaishnava.

Actually, he was an elderly devotee, he was the uncle of Raghunath Das Goswami, and it is said that always he would be chanting Krishna's name, even while doing ordinary work, doing different things, he would always be chanting Krishna's name. He would always be chanting Krishna's name. Another characteristic of this devotee Kalidas was he had great faith in the Vaishnavas, and so what he would do, he would take all kinds of eatables, gifts and go and give it to a Vaishnava, and then after the Vaishnava accepts it, he would induce him, "Please take it away from him, please eat it, honor it," and he would make him, after that with folded hands he would request him, "Can I get some remnants of the Prasadam of what you have eaten?" Chaitanya Charitamruta describes food offered to Krishna, it becomes Mahaprasadam, and when that Mahaprasadam is eaten by a devotee, Vaishnava, pure devotee, and the remnants of that are known as Maha Maha Prasadam. So he would go to a devotee, give him all kinds of food and then request him, "Please give me Maha Maha Prasadam of yours," and sometimes devotees are generally very, very humble, they would say, "No, no, no, we cannot give you, we cannot, please, thank you very much," and would send him away. But he would go out and he would wait and hide. After some time when they come and throw the food something from their house, he would immediately go there, take that one and lick that, so much faith in the Vaishnava and so much faith in the principle of Vaishnava Uchishta. This is called Vaishnava Uchishta, left remnants of what is left over by a pure devotee. So he would do that and then sometimes he would go to another thing this Kalidas would do, he would go to a devotee's house, give them gifts and all that, and then when he is, when they are sending him off, he would make the devotee walk a little distance and then he would send him back. While he is walking, he would keep track of the steps and sometimes an impression is made, and then after this person is gone, he would go there, take the dust from the footmarks and apply it on his head, on his body, Vaishnava Paada Dhooli, Bhakta Paada Dhooli. So he had immense faith in this and he would always do that.

**Summary:** The story of Kalidas drinking Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Paada Jala (foot wash water) highlights the power of Bhakta Paada Dhooli, Bhakta Paada Jala, and Bhakta Bhukta Avashesha (remnants of food eaten by a devotee) in awakening love for Krishna.

and then he came to Jagannath Puri to see Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's daily practice was he would go to, there was one Narasimha Temple, he would go everyday to that Narasimha Temple, and in that when he goes to Narasimha Temple, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu used to chant Namaste Narasimha Aya Prahlada Aladadai, the song we sing, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu used to sing that everyday, Lavakara Kamala Vare, all of that. So he would sing that and then go to Jagannath Temple, and then there was a place where he would wash his feet and then walk up. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu had made a rule, "No one should touch the water that has washed my feet," and Govinda, his assistant, Chaitanya used to have an assistant by name Govinda, he used to keep an eye on that one because it was Mahaprabhu's order. So one day when Kalidas came, he was waiting there, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Paada Jala was so special. So Govinda was pouring water, in a flick of a moment he put his hand there and he drank it three times, and then Chaitanya Mahaprabhu saw, "Enough, stop that, go away," Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, "Thank you," and then he went away, but he managed to sip three times Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Paada Jala. So Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami explains that Bhakta Paada Dhooli, Bhakta Paada Jala, Bhakta Bhukta Avashesha Ina Mahabhala, these three things are considered to be very powerful to awaken that love of Krishna, that attraction to Krishna. Paada Dhooli, the dust from the lotus feet of a devotee, Paada Jala, water that has washed the lotus feet of a devotee, and Bhakta Bhukta Avashesha what? the remnants of the food that a devotee has eaten.

**Key Quote:** "That's the good nature of a woman always they want they are always ready eager to do service."
**Summary:** A story about a stewardess on a flight with Srila Prabhupada eating Maha Maha Prasadam and then offering service illustrates the power of Prasadam and the natural inclination of women to serve.

There is one very interesting pastime in Srila Prabhupada's life. Once Prabhupada was travelling from, in a flight from Mexico City to Caracas, that's in South America, capital of Venezuela. So Prabhupada was travelling and Prabhupada was sitting at the window seat, next to him was his servant, and next to him was another, his secretary. His servant was Shrutakirti, next to him was Paramahamsa Swami, a sanyasi, his secretary. Actually, whenever Prabhupada travelled, they would pack some Prasadam, and Prabhupada was very, very fond of Krishna Prasadam. Always he would insist Prasabhadam is carried even if it's a short flight or a long flight, always devotees would carry Prasadam and Prabhupada would have at different times. So here in Mexico City temple they had made puffed rice, Muri, puffed rice and fried with turmeric and seasoning and nice salt. That was one of the favourite dishes of Prabhupada. Prabhupada used to like that very much. So the devotees had made that very nicely, and then after the flight took off, his servant pulled out from the bag, there was an aluminium foil, he opened it and kept it before Prabhupada, and then Prabhupada ate a few times and then he gave it. So Prabhupada would eat little and then he would give it to the servant, and then Shrutakirti accepted that, he divided that, made it into two and he gave one to Paramahamsa and he was eating. So very happy, Prabhupada's Mahamahaprasadam, they were happy. Just then the steward in the aircraft, it was Venezuela Airlines, so a young woman walked by and she stood next to Paramahamsa and she was staring at what they are eating, some very strange yellow puffed rice for her it was, and very strangely she put her hand into the little plate of Shrutakirti, took a little, put it in her mouth and looked at them and said, "Very tasty," and he was shocked and suddenly some hand coming and he was just recovering and then she said, "What is this?" He didn't know, he said, "You know, we are vegetarians and we eat some of these." "Oh, you are vegetarians, very nice, do you want something more?" And so he asked Prabhupada, "You want something she is asking?" And so Prabhupada said, "Fruits." "Oh yes, I will get you some fruits," she said. And then again she asked, "Do you want anything to drink?" And then he asked Prabhupada, she said, "Prabhupada, she is asking, do you want to drink anything?" And said Prabhupada said, "Hot milk." Prabhupada liked hot milk also and so she said, "Yes, you can give hot milk," and she said, "Okay, if there is anything more also I will get for you," and she went away. So Shrutakirti turned to Prabhupada and said, "Prabhupada, look at this, what a miracle, how she got, how she got maha maha prasadam." I mean he was trying to say that Prabhupada said, "That's the good nature of a woman, always they want, they are always ready, eager to do service." Actually, he was telling about maha maha prasadam, but then Prabhupada was looking at her willingness to bring some fruits and milk and all of those wanting to do. So Prabhupada appreciated her and then she went away and they brought the fruits.

**Key Quote:** "This is the potency of Maha Maha Prasadam of a Vaishnava of a pure devotee."
**Summary:** The story of the stewardess becoming a devotee years later after eating Maha Maha Prasadam highlights the potency of Prasadam and the importance of faith in Vaishnavas to awaken attraction to Krishna, ultimately drowning out life's miseries.

Then much, much 20 years later, Shrutakirti says he was describing this story in one Prabhupada festival in Los Angeles. So after the class one devotee walked up to him and said, "Prabhu, I want to tell you one story," and he said, "Yes, what is this story?" And then he described that how he was a South American devotee and how they would go from small town to town and they would do Harinam, they would do book distribution like that and would go house to house also and give some prasadam and books. So he said somewhere in Brazil, somewhere in a small town outside the town, this devotee and a few other devotees were going from house to house in a truck, in a jeep and showing books. So one house they knocked on and the door opened and there was a woman there and she saw, "Oh, Hare Krishna," very surprised in a place not expected and she said, "Please come in, please come in," and they walked into the house and they see in the house Prabhupada's picture, Krishna's picture like a devotee's house. So they asked her, "How did you come in touch with Krishna consciousness?" And she said, "You know, I met Srila Prabhupada." I said, "Oh, really, how was that?" And then she said, "I was working as a steward in Venezuela Airlines and once I got an opportunity to serve Prabhupada and I ate Maha Prasadam also, Maha Maha Prasadam and that's how it started and then I somehow came in touch with devotees and then and so on and on," and she has become a devotee. This is the potency of Maha Maha Prasadam of a Vaishnava, of a pure devotee. So these are all very, very special things about Krishna consciousness and Krishna Das Kaviraj Goswami says why it is said about these three Paada Jala, Bhakta Paada Jala, Bhakta Paada Dhooli, Bhakta Bhukta Avashesha, it is because the background is it is that enormous faith, that faith in the Vaishnava. Vaishnava is related to Krishna and Krishna has given him the powers to give that attraction to him. If he gives that attraction is awakened, that is an important principle. So if our lives, if the miseries of our life should become drowned and become insignificant, it is very important that that strong feeling for Krishna that is awakened in our heart and we should be begging to Srila Prabhupada, begging to Krishna, begging to the holy name to awaken that, that is an important gift of Chaitanya Maha Prabhu. When that happens, all these different kinds of miseries of old age, death, it will not bother us. Vimukto amrutam ashnute janmam rudyujara dukhair vimukto amrutam ashnute, one will be able to relish and taste transcendence. We will stop here. Grantharaj Srimad Bhagavatam ki.

can never move in such an unrestricted manner. The materialistic scientists' endeavor to reach other planets by mechanical vehicle is only a futile attempt. One can, however, reach heavenly planets by virtuous activities. But one can never expect to go beyond swarga or janaloka by such mechanical or materialistic activities, either gross or subtle. The transcendentalists, who have nothing to do with the gross material body, can move anywhere within or beyond the material worlds. Within the material worlds, they move in the planetary system of mahar, janas, tapa and satraloka. And beyond the material worlds, they can move in the vaikunthas as unrestricted spacemen. Narada Muni is one of the examples of such spacemen and Durvasa Muni is one such mystic. By the strength of devotional service, austerities, mystic powers and transcendental knowledge, everyone can move like Narada Muni or Durvasa Muni. It is said that Durvasa Muni traveled through the world, the entirety of material space and part of spiritual space, within one year only. The speed of the transcendentalists can never be attained by the gross or subtle materialists.

**Key Quote:** "This body is not suitable for any other place other than this planet."
**Summary:** This segment explains the process of knowing the Lord and transferring oneself to the original position, emphasizing that the current material body is specifically designed for Earth and unsuitable for other planets.

So understanding the Lord in the heart, chapter of Bhagavatam, step by step, the process of knowing the Lord and transferring one's attention, transferring oneself to his original position, is being explained here. So anybody who has the ability can transfer his body from this body, transfer his soul from this body to any other planet where he can get a suitable body. As we saw, the yogis, they can transfer themselves. Wherever you want to go, we could go. You want to go to sun planet, want to go to moon planet. Scientists and astronomers, they want to go to many planets in this lifetime. That becomes difficult. You can go to the other planets but you will have to give up this body. Scientists, astronomers, they want to go in this body. Actually they are not even going in this body. They have to cover this body with so many other things. In this body they can't go. They have to cover with so many things which is conducive to the atmosphere in that planet. They cannot expose their body. Wear a coat and suit and I am going to moon. I am going to mars. Not possible. You have to wear the appropriate dress. If you wear the appropriate dress then you could go. So actually they don't, they don't realize that this body is not suitable for any other place other than this planet because they don't know, because this body is made for this planet. This is earth. Earthly place. Earth, water, fire, all these things are present in this world.

**Key Quote:** "It is foolish to go to these places because you are not supposed to be there."
**Summary:** This segment elaborates on the composition of the body based on the five elements (pancha bhutas) and argues that it's foolish to try to explore other planets with this body, as different planets require different types of bodies and senses to perceive their inhabitants.

And our body also consists of these things, because pancha bhutas, maha pancha maha bhutas, earth, water, fire, air, ether, these things are the coverings of this material world. These are the substance with which this world is made. So with these things being in the outer space, it is also present in our body in small, small proportion. So this planet which consists more of earth and water, our body is also more of earth and water. Majority of the body is water covered with fat, marrows and flesh and skin predominantly made of earth. Within this body there is this fire which helps us to sustain, create energy for movement, energy for digestion. Then this subtle energy, fire becomes, this fire becomes subtle energy in the form of all, all nervous systems, all electrical pulses around the body. As I say, we have, body's heart is pumping six liters of this blood in the body. So we don't buy a half HP pump and fit it inside and pump it, connect it to your plug point. Where is the plug point? Where is the power? Body is generating all those things. So body generates power just like a generator. So this is all made for this planet. Suppose you are in sun planet, this body will burn. But say you have a fire body, will you burn? You will not burn. Some other planet you have some other elements. So different planets are having different kinds of elements in different proportion and that suitable body you can be there. You go in this body and go to the, first of all you can go to sun. Say you are going to moon. They say they went to moon. Say you go to moon, now they want to go to mars. So they go to these places and look for, you know, who is there, hello, who is there. You can't see them nor can they hear you. But that doesn't mean there is nobody there. Right? Say you go to the world of ghost and knock and say hello. The ghost can see you. They will say hello. But you can't see them. You can't hear them. So it is foolish to go to these places.

**Key Quote:** "Just because we cannot see, we cannot perceive with the senses doesn't mean they don't exist."
**Summary:** This segment uses analogies of ocean life and sky to illustrate the need for an appropriate form to interact with different environments, emphasizing that the inability to perceive something with our senses doesn't negate its existence, which is a key understanding in transcendental knowledge.

Because you are not supposed to be there. Just like you can't go to the ocean and say hello to the dolphins and come. You need to have the appropriate clothing supporting your life. Then you can go there and play around. In the sky also you have something which keeps you floating. They can fly around and say hi to the birds, the geese are flying around. Same way you cannot go around the space and say oh Narada Muni is going there, Durvasa Muni is going there. Not possible. So we think these are all untrue. But if you sit back and think why not? Right? If the birds can fly, fishes can swim and I can't do that. There may be other living entities who can do something better than me. Something which I can't do. And maybe they can't do what I can do here. The people in Mars cannot come and say see the earthling. No they cannot. So even according to the material understanding looking at these millions and millions of stars it is foolish to think that we are the only people here. Because because Keetha explains spirit soul is sarvagataha, there is no place which is devoid of soul. Soul is everywhere. Even in this room we are only soul, 100 people or 50 people. No there are so many souls. There are so many ants here much more than us. There are so many bacteria here. There is coronavirus also around. Maybe millions of them. So if you say what is the strength of this room? He will say 60. No no no. There are millions and millions of people here in this lecture. So you can say that no no I was talking to millions of souls. Not to 50s. So there are many things in this room which we cannot see. And there are subtle bodies. Maybe some ghost also here in this. Fortunate ghost. Every ghost cannot hear Bhagavatam. Some fortunate ghost can hear. So living entities in subtle form are existing. So just because we cannot see, we cannot perceive with the senses doesn't mean they don't exist. That is the first understanding of a person who knows transcendental knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "So anybody who wants to transcend this material world."
**Summary:** This segment defines transcendentalists as those who seek to transcend the material world through practices like yoga and sense control, highlighting the need to free oneself from the limitations of the material world.

With that understanding we can see truth in what Bhagavatam and Shastras say. Shastras never tell untrue because they know more than us. So we are restricted. So the yogis try to free themselves from this restricted body and restricted mind. Because they know the soul is much much more powerful than this body and this mind. This subtle body. So they want to go away. Go above this material form. How? Through the process of yoga. The process of yoga involves sense control. They are all called transcendentalists. Whether you are a yogi or you are a jnani. Whether a monist or personalist or a Vaishnava. They are all called transcendentalists. Transcendentalist generally means anybody who wants to transcend this material world. Whoever wants to go above the material world. So if you want to go above the material world then you have to deny or you have to be free from the limitations of this world. Then only you can be a transcendentalist. As long as you are drowning in the water you cannot say that you are out of water. When you come out of water then you are out of water. So you need to deny the rules of water. Then you can get into the rules of earth, the shore. So as long as we don't deny the activities of the material world. What are the activities of the material world? Sensitification. Providing what the eyes want. Providing what the nose wants. Providing what the mouth wants. Tongue wants. The skin wants. So as long as we provide these things that the body wants we cannot be transcendentalist. Some people become out of body but they keep giving the materials required for the mind, for the intelligence, for the ego. They are also not transcendentalists because they are stuck with the subtle energies of this material world. Not only the gross energies of the material world but the subtle energies. So they are also called embodied. They are also called muk. They are not the bhadha jivas. But as long as you want to free yourself from this material, the requirements of the body then you are a transcendentalist. Even when you are trying, you are called a trying transcendentalist.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as we deny the requirements of the body, we are transcendentalist."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the different planetary systems and emphasizes that even in this material world, liberation is possible by denying the requirements of the body, which is a prerequisite for going beyond the body and mind through devotional service or other spiritual processes.

So we are also transcendentalists. Trying transcendentalists. We are not following the yoga process or the jnana process. We are following bhakti. Bhakti process. Whichever the process is you are called transcendentalist. So these transcendentalists try to free themselves from these bodily limitations and rise above the body. Above this world, they go beyond this world, Svargaloka. Prabhupada says in this parbhud they cannot go beyond Svarga. Bhuvah, Svaha, Maha, Jnana, Tapa, Satya. These are the seven planetary systems above. Similarly seven below. So fourteen planetary systems. So up to Svarga you can go with material desires. Prabhupada says Jnana, which is part of Svarga. If you want to go to Maha, Tapa, Satya, you can go with the material desires. Prabhupada says Jnana, which is part of Svarga. If you want to go to Maha, Tapa, Satya, you cannot. So the people who are the souls who are in those planets are much much more advanced. Advanced in spiritual knowledge. Means they are free from the bodily bondages. They don't feel hungry like us. They don't feel the senses are just like us. But they are also in the material world. So half of the people in the material world are controllers of the body. But in this earth, you have two options. You can either be free from the bodily conditions or you can be within the bodily conditions. So you can be liberated in this material world, in this earth also. So as soon as we deny the requirements of the body, we are transcendentalist. And that is a prerequisite to go beyond this body and mind. Deny the requirements. So in devotional service or in yoga or any spiritual process, bodily requirements are limited.

#### regulatory principles, karma, internal development

**Key Quote:** "If the same time is involved in internal development, then you can levitate."
**Summary:** This segment explains the importance of regulatory principles and sadhana in elevating the soul out of the body, using the examples of Narada Muni and Durvasa Muni, and comparing the effort spent on material advancements like space travel with the potential for internal development and spiritual progress.

So there is rules and regulations. Do this, don't do this. Regulatory principles. Follow these principles. Do this sadhana. These are all processes of elevating the soul out of this body. So Prabhupada gives two examples. Narada Mani or Durvasa Mani. Durvasa Mani also could travel. So people who are beyond this body, who are becoming beyond this body, they can start travelling everywhere. But you are restricted where you want to go. Just like in this world also, you want to go to the richest country. I want to be in the richest country in this world. Which is the richest country? Now? USA is gone. No more. Say some, I don't know, Denmark, Finland, they are rich. They won't allow you, unless you are also rich like them. First you have to show a balance sheet, your income tax, how much money you have, how much wealth you have, how good you are, what is your professional capacity, what are your abilities, can you contribute to the country, and then you come. So even in this material world, you cannot go to rich places. You want to go to Sudan? No problem. Because you are qualified to go there. Because people there are less qualified than you. But if you want to go to a place which is more qualified than you, conditions are there. So even in this world there are conditions. So if you have good karma, good money, good intelligence, then you are welcome to good places. Same way, if you have good karma, if you have controlled your body, you can go to a place better than this place. Svarga, you can enjoy so many things. Beyond Svarga, Chana, Tapa, Maharloka, Satyaloka, all are yogis. They can go anywhere. Just take off. Travel anywhere. They might be sitting and wondering what these people in earth are doing. Making aeroplanes, making rockets, and getting blasted. Laughter. Why are they struggling so much? The same energy, the same power, the same tapasya. Because all this needs tapasya, right? So much money is needed, so much practice is needed, so much technology is needed for putting one thing to work. So if the same time is involved in internal development, then you can levitate. Right? Why you need food? Aircrafts.

#### material desires, yogic transcendentalists, science of Krishna consciousness

**Key Quote:** "This science of Krishna consciousness has to be understood."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts the desires of materialists with the goals of transcendentalists, emphasizing that the yogic transcendentalists can reach higher planetary systems, but the ultimate goal is to go beyond the material world through the science of Krishna consciousness.

So the soul can be lifted up. The problem is that I want to go with my material desire. I want to go with this mind. I want to go with this conditioning. That is not possible. So we are controlled. So transcendentalists want to go beyond this material conditioning. So the yogic transcendentalists, they can go to Satyaloka, Tapaloka, beyond Svarga. Brahma is in Satyaloka. Everything is dissolved in this material world. Brahmaloka will always be there. Satyaloka will always be there. Until the day of Brahma. That also has to wind up. So traveling to different planets in this material world is not a very big exciting thing for a transcendentalist who want to go beyond this material world. So that is easy for bhakti yogis because bhakti yogis, they understand the Lord who is in this beyond this material world, that is my destination. This is not my destination. My destination is there with the Lord. The Lord with the transcendental body and I also have a transcendental body which is engaged today. That is why this world is called Durga, prison house. We are in the prison house, limited by this body, by the iron bars of this body. So when we are liberated, we are in this spiritual world. So this is called science of Krishna consciousness. Prabhupada always mentioned. This science of Krishna consciousness has to be understood. Those who understand this science, Prabhupada does not say religion, this belief, this faith. This is beyond belief and faith and religion. This is pure science. So people say, no, no, no I cannot be sectarian, I have to be secular. We are not even saying secular or sectarian, we are saying scientific. We are all scientists. We are all scientists. Chandras, Tilak, Shikha. What are we science? What is the science we are following? The science of getting out of this material body. The science of going beyond this body which is limiting us and going to a world which is unlimited. So that world which is unlimited, like Brahma Samhita says, the world, the real world of spiritual life.

#### personalism, devotee's goal, awakening the soul

**Key Quote:** "The process of awakening the soul is this great chanting of liberation."
**Summary:** This segment highlights the importance of intelligence and the right Shastra in understanding personalism beyond material limitations, emphasizing the devotee's goal of gradually understanding the supreme truth and awakening the soul through chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra.

No material body. So to understand that there is personalism beyond this material limitation, you need Sumedha Saha. You need intelligence. And that intelligence comes by reading the right Shastra. Not people who want to create something of their own. That is the beauty of Bhagavatam in the Vaishnava Parampara which clearly describes our rotation and clearly describes what destination we have to go to and how to go to that destination. That is Bhagavatam philosophy. Step by step going out. It may take many lifetimes. Devotees are not concerned about that. Devotees are concerned that am I gradually understanding the supreme truth in its real form and am I understanding the cheating which is going on in this body. Cheating means limitations which is going on in the body. Which is controlling my soul within this body. By making me do what the body wants. By making me do what my mind wants. And what my false ego wants. And not allowing me to do what my soul wants. Soul is sleeping. So the process of awakening the soul is this great chanting of liberation like Prabhupada says. This chanting of Hare Krishna Mahamantra is a great chanting for liberation. Because sound, through sound we can liberate. Yogis try to liberate through yogic practices. Because the life air is controlled. The soul is balanced by the life force within the body. So by controlling the life air he can pull out the soul out. Like we saw in previous verses. How a yogi can pull out from the cerebrum of the head. They can pull out. Transcendentalist can dissolve himself. Naithi, naithi, naithi I am not this body, I am not this body. I am not this matter, I am not this mind.

#### impersonal energy, spiritual activity, material limitations

**Key Quote:** "Activities are not stopped."
**Summary:** This segment discusses the different paths to liberation, including yoga and transcendentalism, and emphasizes that devotees understand the activity of the soul and gain admission into the spiritual world where they can continue activity free from material limitations.

And he understands spirit means some impersonal energy, which is also part of the absolute. Fortunate yogis can go up to Paramatma. And devotees they understand the activity of the soul. When you understand the activity of the soul then we get admission into the spiritual world, where we can continue activity free from all the limitations. Activities are not stopped. So we in the material world sometimes we don't understand what is spiritual activity. Because we know activity means limitation. I can do certain thing. I can only lift 100 kilos. Or maybe 50 kilos. I am limited by my body. I can understand some formula. I can understand beyond that. I am limited by my intelligence. I can desire and own and control this many number of people of this caliber. Not beyond that. Again I am controlled. So that is what happens in this material world of control. How do we go beyond this control? But that doesn't mean that I am not at all controlled. Spiritually also we are controlled. We are eternally controlled. But we are controlled by the Supreme Lord. His internal energy. Control means not like material control. It is just like saying this small finger is controlled by the body. It is not that this is restricted. That control has no restriction. This control has utilization. This small pinky finger is used for this body. What the body wants it does. That way it is subservient to the body. But it is part of the body. And it is also enjoying along with the body. Same way when Prabhupada says the spirit soul is part and parcel of the whole. And it is supposed to serve the whole. It does not mean the servant relationship in the material world. It is a mutually useful relation. Just like the fingers and the body. So the spirit souls are supposed to serve the Supreme Whole. Supreme Lord Krishna. And by that service he is also served. He is also happy. He is also nourished. That is a connection of a devotee and Supreme Lord, which is full of activities, which is free from material limitations, starting from false ego, and all the limiting factors in the material world.

**Key Quote:** "It is up to us whether we want to run around this universe in bliss or we have to run around with fear."
**Summary:** This segment contrasts material and spiritual addiction, highlighting the importance of associating with the transcendental through chanting and surrendering to Krishna's spiritual energy, using the examples of Narada and Durvasa to illustrate the difference between running around in bliss and running around with fear.

Which is different things. Karma, Krodha, Moha, Mada, Matsarya. All these things limit us. Anger limits us. Karma limits us. It doesn't limit us. It makes us a person. Makes us a person who is dependent. Addicted to that. Addicted to material things. But simultaneously we practice being addicted to spiritual things. Gradually, gradually. Chanting of the holy name, which is transcendental. We are associating with transcendental. So we want to be controlled by the spiritual energy of Krishna. Materialists want to be controlled by the material energy of Krishna. Like two personalities given example here. Narada and Durvasa. Narada is controlled by Krishna. But he is free. He can travel anywhere. You can say Durvasa also travelled everywhere. But he is not under the control of Krishna. See what happened to be under the control of Maya. He was a great mystic. But he had this ambition to be a great person. He had the arrogance of belittling others. As long as he has all this arrogance belittling others. Pride. Karma. You are controlling the material world. So that is a controlled life. He is running around the universe. Why is he running around? He is running around because Sudarshan is behind him. But he has a capacity to run because he was a great yogi. He is going to Shivaloka, Brahmaloka almost like Vaikuntha. Must be Swetha Deepa. See that Swetha Deepa is a spiritual world. Even though it is part of material world. He is running everywhere. Narada is also running everywhere. But he is running in bliss. So it is up to us whether we want to run around this universe in bliss or we have to run around with fear.

#### material contamination, spiritual consciousness, sacrificing material things

**Key Quote:** "If our consciousness is materially contaminated then we are in a different consciousness."
**Summary:** This segment explains how Krishna's energy can be displayed according to our consciousness, emphasizing the need to sacrifice material things and cultivate spiritual habits like surrender, humility, and knowledge to achieve a spiritual consciousness.

As long as we are in the grip of material world we are running around with fear. As it is said Krishna's energy of two types. One is energy which is supporting you. Other one is energy which is punishing you. Prabhupada is an example of a cat. The same cat. Same teeth. Very very sharp teeth. It is carrying a kitten. The same teeth it is carrying a rat. A rat is like Durvasa. Shivering and afraid in the mouth of the cat. Narada is like a kitten. In the same mouth. So the energy of the Lord can be displayed according to our consciousness. If our consciousness is materially contaminated then we are in a different consciousness. Material consciousness, which is limiting. If we are in a spiritual consciousness surrendered to the Supreme Lord then we are orbiting in a different orbit. So it is up to us. Today Bhagavatam step by step is teaching how to go beyond the material thing to the transcendental world. So transcendentalists are not interested in roaming around in this world. But they are more interested in freeing themselves and seeing their real form in the spirit, as a spirit soul, and engage in Krishna's service in the spiritual world. So that should be the goal of our life, which may mean denying certain things in this material world. Without sacrificing, we don't get that. So we need to sacrifice material things. So material things are name, fame, position, power, money, women, family, business, power to control. When we give these things up then we inculcate spiritual habits. Spiritual habits are surrender, humility, knowledge, always differentiating what is matter, what is spirit. Engaging only in spiritual activity. Always subservient to the Supreme Lord. And always friendly to all the other creations of the Lord. Not only that we are subservient to the Lord we are subservient to all the other things. All the living entity is created by the Lord. Then he becomes a friend of all the living entity. Then he becomes friend of this world also. Water, air, forest, soil, energies, everything is Lord's. So he uses it all in a friendly way. Not in an exploiting way.

#### devotees, impersonalists, surrender

**Key Quote:** "To give up to become surrendered is very very difficult."
**Summary:** This segment distinguishes between devotees and impersonalists, emphasizing that devotees are dedicated and surrendered to the Lord, while impersonalists are frustrated with the material world and still trying to exploit the Lord, highlighting that surrender is the most difficult thing to achieve.

So two kinds of transcendentalists. One kind of transcendentalists who are called devotees. They are dedicated to the Lord. Other kind of transcendentalists are people who are frustrated with the material world. And they are in a denying position. They are still trying to exploit the Lord. Even impersonalists are not dedicated. They are not surrendered. They are out of the material world but they are not surrendered. So devotee is the only person who is surrendered and who is in the real reality. Others are all assumed reality. Material world is assumed reality. Impersonalism is also a kind of assumed reality because he is not coming to his real position of subservient. He also wants to be like God or Brahma Jyoti. There is still no surrender there. To give up to become surrendered is very very difficult. Most difficult thing. You may say yoga is very difficult. Jnana is very difficult. But actually surrendering is most difficult. So bhakti yuga they say bhakti yuga is for all japa madhav. All for people who don't understand knowledge. People who don't understand yoga. Try to do that. Bring a yogi and tell him to get up for three sixty five days. He will give up and go. He will say no yoga is better. Bring a jnani and tell him to surrender and wash pots everyday. So surrender is most difficult than yoga and jnana. Even though they say that bhakti is for people who don't understand. Sometimes it's good. When you don't understand it's easy to surrender. If you understand too much then it becomes very difficult to surrender also.

**Key Quote:** "A pure devotee he knows going to different planets wasting their time they will say."
**Summary:** This segment explains that bhakti yoga is internally connected to the Supreme Lord, granting devotees knowledge of everything, and emphasizes that a pure devotee understands the futility of material pursuits like exploring different planets, focusing instead on escaping the prison house of the material world.

So one way they are correct. So if you remain simple and humble and uneducated in the material sense, you become educated in the spiritual sense. Because a pure devotee he knows going to different planets wasting their time they will say. They don't know anything about physics. They don't know anything about world economy. But they will simply say simply why are they struggling all these things. Because bhakti yoga is internally connected to supreme lord. When you are in connection with supreme lord you know the entire philosophy entire biology entire chemistry, entire physics entire aerodynamics everything they will know. Why? Everything is created by the lord. So when you say a devotee knows everything it doesn't mean that he is expert in chemistry. He is expert in such a way that he identifies everything as the lord's energy and he keeps it in its place. But he understands the superior position of the spirit and engages in the spiritual activity. Because a person in the jail is not very much interested in becoming popular in the jail. He is saying I want to get out of this jail. I am the most obedient jailer. Or I am the most powerful jail. Jail. What do you call them? Prisoner. I am the great prisoner here. I am the most, I am the best singer prisoner. I am the best body builder prisoner. I am the best intellectual prisoner. You are in the prison. But a humble simple person say I want to finish my 20 years and get out. So this prison house how much knowledge you want of the prison? Same way how much knowledge of this material world we need? Moon, Sun, Mars, billions and billions of stars are there. We are not even know once we went to moon and came back wasted money. If at all we went. Forgot it. Now want to go to another place. This is called Marakatavairagya. Monkey goes to one tree, eats some fruit, throws it then goes to next tree. Eats something, goes to next tree. So he went to moon, not interested. Going to Mars, not interested. They will keep

**Summary:** This segment contrasts objective knowledge of the material world with subjective knowledge concerning the soul and its relationship with everything, emphasizing that true knowledge consists of humility, sastric knowledge, tolerance, and patience.

jumping like this. So what are these planets? What are these stars? What is this material world? What is spiritual world? How to go to spiritual world? What is knowledge? What is not knowledge? In Bhagavad Gita Krishna says what is knowledge and what is not knowledge? Ignorance. You don't find knowledge of chemistry, biology, maths, statistics. You don't find. That is not given as part of knowledge. Knowledge is given as humility, sastric knowledge, tolerance, patience. This is called as knowledge. Because by these things you can really can get the real knowledge. Others are all very objective knowledge of these objects you see beyond you. Other one is a subjective knowledge which is concerning you the soul and your relationship with all that you see. We stop here. Any questions or comments?

**Key Quote:** "The transcendentalists are concerned with spiritual body."
**Summary:** This segment reiterates the importance of focusing on the spiritual body and following regulative principles, emphasizing that fruitive workers cannot move around in an unrestricted manner.

So the transcendentalists are concerned with spiritual body. Not just material body. They are concerned with the soul. And by the strength of devotional service, they go beyond this material world. As long as we are fruity workers or gross materialistic, we cannot move around in this unrestricted manner. Okay. Pooja's. And also Prabhupada mentions that when we chant and follow the four divine principles, Prabhupada takes us back to the body. So when Prabhupada is saying that the four divine principles, that means that the in the six ways. So Prabhupada also says that . . No. When you say regulative principles, it is for the entire body. And what is this entire body? It is gross and subtle. Both together are we. We are not just a gross form. We are not a lump of flesh. This this is grossness and subtleness both are involved. So when you say if regulative principles had to be followed, we should not do that in the subtle form. I am not drinking coffee but 24 hours I am thinking the smell of coffee. So that is not following regulative principles. I want to give up sense gratification but I am sitting and thinking only of sense gratification, nice eating, nice ice cream, nice vehicles going outside,

**Key Quote:** "There is no question of going back to Godhead without 100% purification."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of following regulative principles in both gross and subtle forms, warning against subtle sense gratification and highlighting the need for 100% purification to return to Godhead.

like I joined ISKCON, I can't go out but nice. So that is also subtle sense gratification. Like Krishna says, a person who is not intelligent senses but who is meditating on sense objects is only mithyacharya. He is only a, he is only acting as he is a spiritualist. He is not spiritualist. So when you say you, when Bhagavatam or Gita, anybody says you, it means you the full you. Which is, you means what? You the soul, you the contaminated consciousness, you the subtle body, you the gross body, you with all your karmas, all your prarabdha karmas, all your present thoughts, everything is called you. You is a very general term. So when you say you means, or I, when you say I, I means all these things and I have to follow the regulatory principle. So I have to follow the regulatory principles in the gross form, in the subtle form, in the mental form, in the false ego form, in the imaginative form, in other forms of your existence, of awareness, you should not be aware of that. So we don't be aware of these things but we be aware of Krishna. So when awareness comes, that is consciousness. So we have to consciously not be conscious of the relative, of the force interactivities. We have to be consciously aware of devotional practices. Then we are called followers of Prabhupada. Only then Prabhupada will take you. There is no question of going back to Godhead without 100% purification. And Prabhupada will take only people who are 100% pure. But Prabhupada is available to you to become pure by serving him. That is the meaning of saying, I will take you. Prabhupada when he says, I will take you means what? Even if he is not following forward, drag him and take him back to Godhead. That is not the meaning. When you say Prabhupada will take us back to Godhead, as long as we are followers of Prabhupada, following 100% and becoming pure, then he is a way for us to easily go to Krishna. That is the meaning of that. Not that even if you are not qualified, no, no, no, Prabhupada will take us back to Godhead. Just like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, you chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra, Harinam, Sankirtan, that is enough. You will get mukti. But along with that comes a big rule. What is the big rule? Ten offences showed in it. So chanting, you chant Haripol, Haripol, Haripol, you can come, but along with that you have to do ten things to give up. That giving up is a many lifetimes job.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how modern science, particularly Einstein's equation, validates the concept of the Brahmastra and suggests that the Srimad Bhagavatam contains advanced scientific knowledge.

I think two weeks back, when I took class and all of you were here, I explained how the Brahmastra, if we had read about it in the year 1900, in the beginning, no scientist would believe that, 'Oh, what is this they are talking about? Brahmastra, a weapon which is just like that, just like that, from nothing, light would come out, heat would come out.' They would never believe. But after the 1920s, later on, after Albert Einstein wrote that famous equation E=mc squared, that mass can be converted into energy, so mass is everywhere, atoms are everywhere, any atom can be converted into energy. It is a very difficult process, means difficult in modern technology, but a well-trained Brahmana could release this Brahmastra, could release this energy. And this is what we discussed last time, how whatever the Shastra says, it is a great science. Science is included, this modern science is included in the Bhagavata.

**Key Quote:** "If we hear the Mahamantra attentively without any distraction, mantra after mantra if you hear that, then our Atma will touch our soul, our real existence will touch the absolute existence Krishna."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of attentive chanting (Japa) of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra to connect the soul with Krishna and liberate it from the illusion of material existence.

For that, we have to come in touch with the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, with the sound of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Therefore, we discussed how during Japa, we have to attentively hear the Mahamantra. If we hear the Mahamantra attentively without any distraction, mantra after mantra, if you hear that, then our Atma will touch, our soul, our real existence will touch the absolute existence, Krishna, because the Nama is not different from the Lord himself, from the absolute existence. And when there is transfer of Sat Shakti from the Hare Krishna Mahamantra by touching the supreme Sat or existence, our existence will be lightened up, our pure eternal existence will lighten up, will get energized. Right now, our Sat, means existence, we all know we exist beyond this body also. We know there is existence, that sense of being, sense of existence is now trapped by the material energy, and therefore we are thinking we are this body. Therefore, the existence, existence which is existence means eternal existence, eternal existence is trapped in this body of non-existence. Beyond this body, eternal existence is beyond this body. This body is beginning to end, so one small existence we experience in this body, but actually we, the soul, is eternal existence. So we are actually trapped in this non-existence. Non-existence means anything that has beginning and end has no existence ultimately. Existence means it should forever remain there. So we are trapped, the real existence or real Sat is trapped in Asat body.

**Summary:** The speaker explains how connecting with the Hare Krishna Mahamantra allows the flow of Sat energy, illuminating one's eternal existence, and how distractions of the mind hinder this process during Japa.

So by touching the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, by touching the sound Hare Krishna Mahamantra, when there is flow of Sat energy by the mercy of the Lord, then one's existence would lighten up its eternal existence beyond this body. But it is energy that has to come into you. That energy can come only by associating with Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Then we discussed how actually we can come in touch with the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. The real way to touch the Hare Krishna Mahamantra is through Japa, but then Japa should be done in a right way so that the touching of the soul and the Hare Krishna sound happens. For that, we said we have to be attentive to hear the holy name during Japa, and then we discussed how the mind creates, takes away attention from Japa into various different thinking processes, processing, lamenting, rejoicing, dreaming, planning, all this kind of things, activity our mind gets sucked into it while we are doing the Japa. So when the attention is sucked by all these activities, thinking activities, attention is not available for hearing the chanting that you are doing, therefore you are not, your Atma is not touching the holy name.

**Key Quote:** "Your Japa is just automatic, you are chanting round after round and then your Japa is finishing but your thinking has not finished."
**Summary:** The speaker describes how inattentive chanting leads to mechanical repetition without genuine connection, emphasizing the need for continuous attention during Japa to avoid disconnection.

Then after that, your Japa is just automatic. You are chanting round after round, and then your Japa is finishing, but your thinking has not finished. You are continuing your problem solving, planning, lamenting, rejoicing, dreaming, worrying, or doing some other activity. I did, last time we discussed, you are doing some other activity, your mind is busy directing your senses, but you are automatically chanting. The whole key thing is the sound you have to hear. We discussed the example of the iron put in the fire, and the iron is put in the fire, slowly it gets heated, heated, heated and becomes red hot. So in the same way, the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, if you touch the sound, then our Atma will get spiritualized, the spiritual energy will come from the holy name, how we will get spiritualized. But it is not, suppose you take a piece of iron, put in the fire, again take it out five minutes, then again one minute in the fire, then again five minutes outside, then again one minute inside, five minutes outside, will it get really heated? No, because you put inside, it comes out again, it is cooling off, isn't it? So in the same way, if we chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra, if you give attention to it, we have to give continuous attention to finish a Mala. In between, you should not do anything.

**Key Quote:** "You should make a sankalpa to keep the iron in the fire for quite some time, at least one Mala you take, nothing I shall do now from beginning to end of this Mala, I shall continue to do this only nothing else."
**Summary:** The speaker advises making a firm resolve (sankalpa) to maintain continuous attention during at least one round of Japa, avoiding any distractions to prevent disconnection from the sound (Shabda).

If you do anything, then you are, you are taking out of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra, you are taking your soul out, gets disconnected. And why disconnection also is like a inattentive, means one of the ten offenses is what? To be inattentive while chanting. So you are attentive a little, taking attention away, some thinking, again thinking, or sometimes nothing, not even hearing one. So what is required is you should make a sankalpa to keep the iron in the fire for quite some time, at least one Mala you take, nothing I shall do now. From beginning to end of this Mala, I shall continue to do this only, nothing else. And we discussed how mind can do one activity which will not disturb Japa. What is that activity? Can somebody tell who was there? Checking, following and checking. So following and checking continuously, you should not break. Why you should not break? Because if you break, mind doesn't keep quiet, it goes to some other subject. That means you get disconnected from the Shabda.

**Summary:** The speaker suggests engaging the mind by actively following the activity of chanting and hearing, similar to following a ball in table tennis, to maintain focus during Japa.

So you have to follow, follow and check, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. And I gave the example last time of how, I gave the example of how, what is this following activity of the mind, thinking activity, lamenting, all those listed, I listed it. There is one activity of the mind which you can follow, follow a doing, follow an activity. Just like if I tell you, please follow the, somebody is playing table tennis and I tell you engage your mind in following the ball where it goes. So your mind is going there, here, here, here, here, your attention is behind the ball where it is going, this side, that side, this side, this side it's going, isn't it? That is the mind can follow an activity. So similarly, the mind should follow the activity of chanting and hearing, and by doing that automatically you are hearing, automatically you are hearing, your attention is following the activity of your attention is on the hearing.

**Summary:** Using the analogy of counting train bogies, the speaker illustrates how focusing attention on a specific task keeps the mind engaged, and reiterates the importance of continuous attention during chanting, comparing it to keeping iron in the fire to heat it thoroughly.

Another example I gave you is how if you are standing in the railway station, railway platform and one train is going across and if I tell you just count the number of bogies that will go by then your attention will be one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 100 90 101 12 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 30 you should hear, hear, hear, hear, hear without break, hear, hear, hear, hear then only the iron is inside the fire.

**Key Quote:** "At least train yourself that one mala is I will have a sankalpa that from beginning till end of this mala I have a sankalpa I will not do anything with my mind but only follow the Hare Krishna mantra."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of making a strong resolve (sankalpa) to focus solely on the Hare Krishna mantra during Japa, defining Japa as a meditation on doing rather than seeing.

For sufficiently long time, then you will see one mala at least, afterwards one mala also move the sakshi mala and go on, but at least train yourself that one mala is, I will have a sankalpa that from beginning till end of this mala, I have a sankalpa I will not do anything with my mind but only follow the Hare Krishna mantra. For instance, if he does not release the sankalpa, I have started now, first bead, he should release the sankalpa from the soul, sankalpa shakti comes from the soul, from the sankalpa then it goes to the mind, then Krishna deepens will help you make that sankalpa stronger, but you have to start your sankalpa, I want to hear without distraction, that sankalpa is there, then you will see that it will happen. If you don't have sankalpa, simply Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, if you don't have sankalpa shakti from the soul coming, you will see suddenly somewhere mind will take and go away and then you chanting will become mechanical, your consciousness attention is somewhere else. So each of our soul shakti, ICCHA shakti, ICCHA is very clear to touch the Holy name of the Lord, then sankalpa should be there to finish mala after mala after mala after mala. So Japa, it's actually a meditation on doing. It is not a meditation on seeing. It's a meditation on doing.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between meditation on seeing and meditation on doing, explaining that Japa is the latter, requiring focused engagement in chanting and hearing, and that the mala aids in giving the mind a connected task.

That means we have, there is a particular thing being done: chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting. Meditation means what? Don't move out of that activity. Stay in that activity. That is meditation of doing. What is meditation of seeing? Don't take your vision from something. Be there only. Be concentrated, concentrated, concentrated seeing. Say, I keep on seeing this mic. Don't take your mind, don't take your mind anywhere other than that. Seeing, seeing, seeing, seeing. Japa is not seeing meditation. Japa is doing meditation. That means don't do anything else. Stay only this, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing, chanting, hearing. Complete, mala, beat after beat, beat after beat, beat after beat. That is, that is why you need, you don't need seeing concentration for Japa. You need doing concentration. There are two things that are happening. One doing is you are speaking. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, speaking. Another doing is what? You are hearing. There are two activities going on. Speaking and hearing, speaking and hearing, speaking and hearing. This activity alone, you follow this. You follow your own speaking and you follow your own hearing. Then you will see that. Automatically, the mind is fully engaged. The mind will not go somewhere else. And I explained last time also, the spiritual technology, why the, our acharyas are given mala to do Japa with mala. It is to give work to the mind. To give work to the mind. Otherwise, mind will do unrelated work. Let it at least do a work which is connected to Japa. Okay, I heard. One is over. Two is over. Three is over. It's connected work.

**Summary:** The speaker reiterates the importance of maintaining a strong resolve (sankalpa) and determination to stay focused on the sound of the Hare Krishna mantra during Japa, preventing the mind from wandering and ensuring a connection with the divine.

When you chant, initially, you start with the first beat. I have to hear. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then next, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama. Between the two beats, the sankalpa shakti should be there to go, to go forward. Should not. There has, your soul has to be. When you are trying to chant, then the mind will slowly take you out of the fire. When you are hearing Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, you are already in the fire of Satchidananda. That is the Hare Krishna mantra, if you are hearing. But the mind slowly takes you out of the fire, just like the iron piece. The mind comes and takes you out of the fire. So you have to insist, have sankalpa, determination. Yes, at least this one mala, I will be inside. Nothing. I won't come out of this sound. Jaya Grandarachi. Madbhagavatam ki jaye. Jagat Guru Shiloprao paad ki jaye. Hare Krishna Maha Mantra ki jaye.

were completely floored by the beautiful woman, and after that they simply seized her, grabbed her, they embraced her. So Prabhupada is explaining here that the Asuras are described as Mudadhya, meaning they are captivated by ignorance. So only those who are captivated by the mode of ignorance and passion will subject themselves to this force of false attraction, illusory attraction in this material world, and they are considered to be Mudadhya, means not very intelligent, or they are foolish.

**Key Quote:** "One gives experience of gold, the other one is real gold and real gold also gives experience of gold but it has also got the value of gold that is a difference."
**Summary:** Using the analogy of real gold versus plated gold, the speaker explains the difference between experiential truth and existential truth, highlighting that true value lies in something being both experientially and existentially true.

In other words, if you really want to buy gold, then you have to, unless you get real gold, you are cheated. Something will be gold-like, plated gold. It will look bad, but look like gold for the senses. It looks like gold. There's no difference between the rolled gold and the plated gold and real gold. There's no difference for the senses, but for the value there will be a difference. One has no value, the other has got very high value comparatively, and one has no value. So one gives experience of gold, the other one is real gold, and real gold also gives experience of gold, but it has also got the value of gold. That is the difference. One is experientially true, the other one is experientially true and existentially true. In existence also it is real gold.

**Key Quote:** "To establish the existential truth of something, any amount of experiences with the senses will not determine that truth. One has to go beyond the senses and go to the intelligence."
**Summary:** The speaker asserts that sensory experience alone cannot establish existential truth; one must go beyond the senses to intelligence and spiritual knowledge (Guru, Sadhu, and Shastra).

So any sense perception, anything that we see, if it is only true experientially, it is not necessary that it is truth. Truth has to be established independently on the basis of experience. For instance, you watch a movie. Once you go into the movie world, it's a real experience. It is a real experience. The experience is as real as real life experience, no difference. But is that true existentially true? No. Experientially true, but existentially false. Now if you want to analyze, you want to, whether that movie is existentially true or experientially, I am seeing it is true. Now I want to find out whether it is existentially true. So you analyze the movie more and more. The movie plot, you go into the movie plot. Okay, in the movie plot, this character, that character, you go on analyzing. Will you ever come out of the movie? No. In other words, to establish the existential truth of something, any amount of experiences with the senses will not determine that truth. One has to go beyond the senses and go to the intelligence. And intelligence, the source of that intelligence should be independent of that movie, because intelligence is not coming from the movie. And that is the third source. It is not coming from the movie, and that is spiritual knowledge.

**Key Quote:** "There is only way to establish whether an experience is existentially true or not, is by a third source, that is Shastra."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that Shastra is the only reliable source for determining whether an experience is existentially true, as our senses are prone to illusion.

Guru, Sadhu and Shastra. The spiritual knowledge, even though it is available in ordinary, material paper, material ink. It is available here. PRESENT TRUTH. But that is not real spiritual knowledge. It is manifesting like this, like any other ordinary book. But the vibration, the sound that is generated, the sound that it represents, this transcendental knowledge, that is the independent source, independent of our sensual perceptions. Our sensual perceptions can make mistakes, commit tendencies for illusion, cheating, all these things. So there is no question of establishing whether something is illusion or whether something is true by your senses, you cannot. There is only way to establish whether an experience is existentially true or not, is by a third source, that is Shastra.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that while all sense experience in the material world is illusion, a devotee filters experiences through the lens of the shastras, engaging in authorized sense gratification, which is better than being an Asura.

He is using intelligence, knowledge and intelligence. Subtitles by the Amara.org community Subtitles by the Amara.org community Subtitles by the Amara.org community Pleasure means, experience means, I'll jump over it. Whereas a gentleman, a human being, who is progressive in his life, he accepts pleasures which are only, not only experiential, but it should also have, and every experience in this material world, every sense experience is illusion. Among the illusions, again there is filter, what is permitted by the shastras. Just like Krishna says, I am sex life according to regulative principles. So, a sura, or a devotee, he falls in love. He falls into the category of authorized sense gratification. That's kamabhakta. They are not talking about pure devotees. Asuras and suras, you can say. Whereas a pure devotee, he sees that this is all illusion. Authorized or unauthorized, it's all illusion. If I can come out of it, that is the purpose of moving from asuric thing to suric thing. That means by becoming an obedient sense enjoyer is better than being an asura.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that those seeking ultimate truth understand that experiences are generated by the material body, mind, and intelligence, while the soul merely observes, identifying with the feelings of the 'yantra' (machine).

That is the verdict of the scriptures. But ultimately, those who want to go out of this material world, those who want ultimate truth, absolute truth, they understand that all these things are created by this body, which is body, mind and intelligence, which is a material yantra. And all experiences are generated out of this yantra. And the soul is only a kshetrajna. Soul is not feeling anything. Soul is feeling the feeling. Soul is not directly feeling anything in this world. When you feel angry with someone, you are not angry. Your kshetra is generating that anger and you are identifying with that anger. It is not direct feeling. The feeling of the yantra, you are identifying. Thinking of the yantra, you are identifying. Impulses of the yantra, you are misunderstanding to be your decision, your impulses. prakṛtaya kriyamānāni guṇaya karmāni sarvaśa āhankāraṁ itimam āhankāraṁ kartāḥ itimanyate So, only by a false ego, one thinks one is doing, one is, you know, it is my feeling, it is my, I am angry, etc., etc. I am having pleasure, all these things.

**Summary:** The speaker compares Maya to a jeweler who expertly duplicates gold, creating illusions of thinking, feeling, and willing, just as the soul does, to deceive people in the material world.

So, but the nature of the soul is to feel, to think, feel and will. Body cannot think, feel and will. But at the same time, maya is so powerful, she creates an illusion of thinking, feeling and willing. Just like the jeweler is so expert, that he plates it and makes it appear like gold. Copper, he will make it appear like gold. So that all the customers will go and buy it, pay the price of gold and buy it. Foolish customers will go, pay the price of gold and buy it. In the same way, in this material world, maya is expert, expert like a jeweler who cheats. She is expert. Her job is to duplicate the gold of the spiritual world here. Her business is to duplicate beauty here. Just like rolled gold will be only skin deep, isn't it? If you bend that copper like this, suddenly inside you will see copper. So it is little micron thickness. So the truth of that gold is only micron thickness, isn't it? Similarly, the shastra says that all beauties in this world is only skin deep. The luster of the skin, etc. is duplicated just like in the spiritual world. The color, the luster, everything. The look, it looks like that.

**Summary:** Using the analogy of a mannequin in a saree shop, the speaker explains how Maya duplicates names, forms, and qualities, triggering desires and illusions in our minds, leading us to paste our identity onto the body.

We don't think. Just like in the saree shop outside you have mannequins. Fiberglass model of women and they wear saree. They decorate that mannequin with saree. Those who have desire, they see if people don't, if people see it as plastic. You think anybody, anybody will set it up outside the shop. Outside the shop. Suppose everybody is knowledgeable. Plastic. Those who have desire, they will see that model wearing the saree. They will project their own face there, how nice I will be there. And then they will enter the saree shop. Because this is how it is. We create in our mind illusion. And that mannequin, that fiberglass doll is just a trigger in your mind. You are just waiting to see how you will feel in that shanee. So in the material world, varieties of names and forms and qualities and persons and everything is duplicated by maya. But the person, where is the person? The person is in the body. You don't even see the person. The person is travelling in the body. But you paste, we paste the identity of the person onto the body.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that we live in a bodily concept of life, residing in the subtle body, and Krishna consciousness aims to shift us to a spiritual concept of life, realizing ourselves as spirit souls with the potential for a sacchidananda body.

We ourselves first paste our identity that I am this body. And we continue going on life like this. Right from childhood we are grown, slowly we start identifying how. Each of our limbs are under our control, so it's me, it is me. I cannot control your hand, so I don't think that hand is mine. I can control my hand, so I think this is me. Hand, leg, so finally you think this body is me. And then you create a bodily concept of life. Body is different, bodily concept is different. Bodily concept is where? It is in the subtle body. So actually we are living in bodily concept of life. We are not living in the body. If you are living in the body then you become immediately conscious. Oh, what is this? This is a yantra. But you live in the bodily concept of life. So Krishna consciousness is meant to take us out of this bodily concept of life and come into spiritual concept of life. I am spirit soul. To start with. Then I am sacchidananda body. That one gets a sacchidananda body.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that spiritual progress requires changing our perception, seeing people not as bodies but as conscious souls, understanding that the body is merely a neutral extension of the pancha bhuta (five elements).

Which is duplicated by material energy in this world. So by hearing, the scriptures, that is intelligence, one changes his perception. Because illusion is a perception. Unless and until we start seeing people differently, we will also be in the bodily concept of life. A spiritualist, a devotee, he starts seeing people. Perception of people is the most important thing for spiritualist. One who is interested, one who is progressing in spiritual life, one who wants to be a Vaishnava, his perception of people is very important. One cannot perceive the others as bodies. One should see, separate the body. A body is simply neutral. Body has actually no consciousness. Consciousness is separate, body is separate. There is no difference between the body and the floor in which you are sitting. It is just an extension of pancha bhuta, that's all. That much pancha bhuta in your body, which is your body, you have control, that's all. But there is no difference on the floor. Because floor also doesn't talk, body also doesn't talk. Isn't it? Floor also doesn't think, your body also doesn't think. Floor also doesn't feel, your body also doesn't feel. The soul in the body thinks, the soul in the body feels, the soul in the body wills.

**Key Quote:** "So that's why maya has created this body, so all quality should appear."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Maya has created the body to duplicate the qualities of the soul (thinking, feeling, willing), leading to the illusion of identifying with the body and its characteristics, such as being male or female.

my soul's thinking is influenced by this yantra. This is very nicely set up pancha bhuta, which duplicates, like a person. Because you see, if you want to duplicate gold ornaments, by just giving a layer of gold, you have to be very expert. Everything that appears there in the real gold should also appear here. All quality should appear here. So that's why maya has created this body, so all quality should appear. What is the quality of a soul? Thinking, feeling and willing. So you think you are the body, and the body is thinking, feeling and willing. I am this body, I am a man, I am a woman. So my moment I say I am a woman, my feeling, my identification, everything is colored of being a woman. I am a man. Immediately your consciousness is colored as a man. So the attraction in the material world, if you see the attraction between male and female, that's the subject that is here, the attraction between male and female has no sound basis in the spiritual platform. Why? Because to say that I am a male is first illusion, to say that I am a female is another illusion. So it is founded on illusory self-concept.

**Key Quote:** "To say that I am a male is first illusion, to say that I am a female is another illusion."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that attraction between male and female is based on the false ego and illusory self-concept, originating from the body rather than the soul.

That means illusory self-concept is called false ego. Self-concept is ego. Illusory self-concept is called false ego. So it is based on false ego. So therefore you know, you don't have to think that if a man feels towards a woman something, he doesn't have to feel, is my soul feeling, I am little doubtful, is it the soul feeling or the body feeling? It must be my soul's feeling. Soul is in love with nothing. All originated from body only. Soul is only a kshetrajna. So soul is knowing that, is feeling that I am feeling, to be a woman or a man. So these fine things to come out of this illusion,

**Summary:** The speaker states that overcoming illusion is difficult but can be made easier by associating with the holy name, which is the source of true knowledge and allows us to see with the eyes of intelligence rather than being deceived by Maya's expertise.

it is not easy. Not at all easy, but it is very easy if we associate with the holy name, because it is the source of all knowledge and knowledge means not information. I am not the body, information at the intellectual level you can have. Knowledge means perception. You don't see what your eyes sees. You see with the eyes of intelligence. If you look at the, with what the eyes sees, it look like gold. Similarly if you look just at what the eyes sees, then okay, because Maya is expert in her job, it look like such is Ananda body only, male, female, everybody.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of seeing through the lens of shastra, recognizing that the material world is skin deep and that the soul is often haunted by a bodily concept of life, leading to a replacement of identity.

But I cannot see what my eyes sees, I should see what my shastra tells to see, yes, yes, this is a duplication of, this skin deep, all male, female, everybody is skin deep only. Skin deep false personality. The real personality is, is sitting inside and is, and is haunted by this bodily concept of life. So even a karmi when he is speaking, who is speaking? Soul is speaking. That sense. Speaking means not, soul is experiencing that speaking. But it is speaking in a haunted manner. Suppose you are haunted, how will you speak? You will, haunted means at the identity level, a little replacement has happened. Suddenly you say okay now, so and so suddenly gets haunted. He is not the same person, you will see. Somebody else gets into your body and he utilizes the body. That is called, haunting.

Exactly the same way. This false ego, this haunting goes to the problem. Body is not a problem, for spiritualists. Body is not a problem, body can be used in Krishna's service. This ghost, comes into the body, enjoys, afterwards it goes away. Where it goes away? Into the memory. Then your normal self will come. Hey, why did I indulge in this? I should not have. Who is talking now? What happened? Earlier who indulged? Somebody else came inside and indulged. Aiyaram, Gayaram, they said. You know, fly by night operators are called Aiyaram, Gayaram. Suddenly they will come open on business, collect all monies, and suddenly shop is closed. It disappeared, with everybody's money. So all these sense gratificatory, false egos are all like, fly by night operators. They will come in the night, and then they will go away, afterwards. Then you wake up for Mangalarati.

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "I am a person, capable of thinking, feeling and willing. I am not a male person, I am not a female person, I am a person."
**Summary:** The speaker advises disassociating from the concepts of male and female, focusing on being a person capable of thinking, feeling, and willing, and ultimately identifying as a servant of Krishna, utilizing the body in His service, which is the essence of Bhagavad Dharma.

looted and went away? So this approach we should take, this identification should not be there. To remove, to deal with false ego over many many years, you should start disassociating with this concept of I am a male, I am a female, that concept itself. That's not. I am a person, capable of thinking, feeling and willing. I am not a male person, I am not a female person, I am a person. First you are a person. What is the characteristic of a person? Somebody who can think, feel and will. Then you get color of a male or a female onto the person. Is it not? So pure person means, I am thinking, feeling, willing. I am a person who is servant of Krishna. Even in gross, gross bodily concept also you can be there. But as long as you remember that I am, this body is servant of Krishna. I am this body, I am the servant of Krishna, no problem. As long as you, just like in the spiritual body, in the spiritual world also, you have a spiritual body. So about this body, that's why you, why do we think we put all the Vaishnava, Tilak all over the body? Because you see we are treating this body like Sachidananda body. That means like in this spiritual world I have hands, I have to use my hands to serve Krishna. So here I have this body, hand is there, I have to use for serving Krishna. So having a body is not a handicap for real Vaishnavas, whereas impersonalists and mayavadis, this is a big problem. For them it's, you know, no form, no fame, no qualities for the body, for the person has no qualities, no thinking, no feeling, no willing. Ultimately I have to eliminate thinking, feeling and willing, I have to become pure awareness, they say. For us pure awareness is a foundation. Then we have got pure senses, we have got pure body, we have got pure activity, pure services in the spiritual world, in the Vaikunthallam. And that is what we learn from Srimad Bhagavatam, that is Bhagavad Dharma. Dharma of personality and...

**Summary:** Lord Shiva is described as being in charge of the mode of ignorance but detached from material nature, engaged in service to the Supreme Lord, which is also the spirit of Vaishnavas.

The position of Lord Shiva is that He is in charge of all the living entities in the mode of ignorance. He takes care of them for their material desires. Those who are inflicted by the three modes of material nature, at every opportunity they are trying to get material pleasure for their body, for their mind, for their intellect, for their false ego. Even though He is in charge of the mode of ignorance in this material world, He is unaffected by any of the modes of material nature. He is exemplified by His detachment from this material world. He never accepts luxurious dress, garland, ornament, etc. He is engaged in His own Self. Only one who is engaged in His own Self can actually be free from the three modes of material nature. He understands His own Self as part and parcel, as part of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Knowing that, He is always engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is the spirit of the Vaishnavas also.

So stop thinking during Japa. Thinking means you are hearing your thoughts. If you hear your thoughts, you cannot hear Holy Name. If you hear me, you cannot hear somebody else. Just like when you are hearing me, you are not hearing so many sounds that are going around. So either you hear the Nama, Avatara or you are hearing your thinking. Your thinking is not fire, your thinking is ice. It will be fire. It will pull you more, it will take you more into asat achit nirananda.

But you can go into more maya. You can forget japa also. Then you go to Svargaloka. Because there is so much of material opulence and material things. But we do not want to go to Svarga. We do not want. Again Svargaloka, punya you get, you come back again. Up and down, you have to travel. Birth, death, old age, disease. Where do we all want to go? We want to go to Krishnaloka.

You cannot go back anymore of this drama. One body to another body. This is a body life, this has no meaning. We have created meaning for it. What you go through one life, one mosquito goes through in one day. We can say what is the value of life. You see animals, you see cats, dogs. So many cats come, come, so many cats die.

So here, this verse says that King Prithu, who was engaged in performing as a King, Ashwamedha Yajna, the utmost fructive activities to bring forth fruits of prosperity within his kingdom. When he does Ashwamedha Yajna, he is engaging all the Karmiminded citizens. They are the one who are organizing, doing everything. Otherwise, one would ask why Prithu Maharaj is doing fructive activities. He should be teaching them devotional service, being an empowered incarnation of the Lord. The point is that for the living entities who are in different stages of their spiritual evolution in this material world, larger part of the material world, they are all Karmis. And good Karmis means who engage in Karma according to Guru, Sadhu and Shastra for material Artha, Kama, Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha. Those who engage their activities of sense gratification, they are called Karmis. For Artha, for economic development, these are all Karma. And that is done according to Dharma. Dharma precedes.

So now Maharaj, Prithu is engaging all these people in the fructive activities and they are performing this Ashramedha Yajna.

A broader conception of Karma, we can see that even today, people have to go to work, they have to go through very many hardships. Hmm? Yes. Hardships means Tapasa, hmm? All the Tapasa that, Tapas, without Tapas, even this world cannot run now. Maybe it is Ugra Karma, but there is Tapas and that is why they get result, fruity result. They do fruity activities and fruity results. So fruity activity necessarily involves sacrifice. Therefore it is said that the Lord in everybody's heart is sitting in the middle of the world. He is seated as a super soul and whatever they do as a sacrifice, that is all noted and those sacrifices are generally called Punya, okay? Yajna, Dhana, Thapa, different kinds of sacrifices are there, different kinds of sacrifices please the Supreme Lord. Okay? Yes. Yes. In the material world, the law of Karma is that as you sow, so you reap.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of performing actions as a sacrifice to Krishna (yajna artha karma) and highlights Krishna's role in the material world and the nature of His enjoyment.

So work as a sacrifice, yajna artha karma, yajna artha karma. Everybody has to do yajna artha karma. But in this Kali Yuga, nobody is doing yajna artha karma. They are simply doing karma. So still, that karma, that sacrifice, that impersonal sacrifice does produce some result and that also Krishna calculates, seated in the heart as a super soul and gives their phala. This is the way the material world is running. So therefore, Krishna, He is the Parama Purushottama. Supreme Ishwara and His expansion as a super soul in the material world, as the father of all the living entities, aham vija prajapita, father of all living entities. He is supplying everyone according to their work. This is His arrangement. So in this material world, Krishna, He is the one who gives the phala. So in this material world, Krishna, He is the one who gives the phala. He is the one who gives the phala. The Purushottama, the Parama Ishwara, He is in this material world as the Supreme Ishwara of this material world. So this material world is running according to the scheme of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to give opportunity for unlimited living entities to be free to do what they want according to their karma. Or, they are free. Potentially. Potentially, if they are free to simply engage in devotional service of the Lord, that means to keep Krishna as the center of all their activities, Krishna's pleasure as a center of all their activities, Krishna as the center of, as the enjoyer of all the activities. Krishna's enjoyment is not like our enjoyment. Super Souls' enjoyment is not like our enjoyment. Super Souls' enjoyment is not like our enjoyment.

**Summary:** This segment explains that chanting Hare Krishna pleases Krishna, and that the sound produced becomes Shakti Avesha, ultimately non-different from Krishna.

Supersoul's enjoyment is in his own standards. What is his standard? When the living entities performs Sankirtanayajna, Lord is pleased for us. Because Lord is completely self-sufficient, fully. When we say we please the Lord, we have to understand that Lord is an ocean of pleasure. And his pleasure from devotional service of his devotees, especially in this material world, is that of the pleasure of the children coming back to the right path. This gives him pleasure. Therefore when we chant Hare Krishna, it gives pleasure to Krishna. It gives pleasure to Krishna because we are sadhakas and we are taking his name. We are taking advantage of his pleasure. This is Avatara, Shakti Avesha. Now Avatara, the sound that we produce with our tongue becomes the Shakti Avesha. Avatara, not only living entities become Shakti Avesha, even sound, even matter sound produced by us with our tongue, it becomes Shakti Avesha. Just see. And then that sound, as long as all the Shakti, Satya, Chittan, Ananda Shakti enters that sound, it's no longer material sound. Nothing matter remains when Sat Chit Ananda, pure Sat Chit Ananda – Avesha enters the sound. So all matter disappears in that sense. No material qualities exist in the sound. In this material world – Hare Krishna, Rama. No material thing, material effect or three gunas exist in the sound. Similarly, no three gunas exist in the Archa-vigraha where the matter-vigraha is Sat-Chit-Ananda-Ist by the Avesha of that Shakti along with the Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan is there as a person who is incarnated. Similarly, Shakti Avesha Nama, Krishna's Nama in the spiritual world, Shuddha Nama is a Vekthi, is non-different from Krishna. The Nama persona of Krishna is same as Krishna.

So Nama 100%, Rupa Krishna, Nama Krishna all same, Leela Krishna all 100% same. Same Vekthi. In different aspects. So this Nama, Shuddha Nama of the spiritual world, Krishna's Rupa is there in the spiritual world. Similarly, Krishna's Nama is there in the spiritual world. Everything is eternal. So Krishna's Nama is eternally vibrating in the spiritual world. That eternally vibrating Nama in the spiritual world. He takes Avatara, He enters the sound uttered by us. First He enters as the Shakti. We are not qualified to directly even relate with the Shuddha Nama. Therefore first Shakti comes. The Shakti comes, bathes us, purifies us, cleans us, awakens a bit of our Bhakti towards Krishna. To that degree our chanting also keeps Him. To that degree our chanting also keeps Him. So it is the same. elevating its quality, first touching the Shakti, getting purified by realizations, by Sat realization, Chitta realization, Ananda realization. So gradually by Ananda realization we give up all taste for Jadananda or bogus, fake, cheating, false, imitation Anandas of this material world of love, sense pleasure, power, everything. There is a full realization in the devotees by the mercy or the flow of Sat Chitta Ananda of the entire cheating game and how then there is realization of how I am the loser in this material world, what I am entitled to is pure Sat Chitta Ananda, what I am entitled to in association with

Krishna. He is pure Sat Chitta Ananda.

So all these Asat, Achitta, Nirananda which is, which is, faking as Sat Chitta Ananda in this material world are like glass pieces, which look like a diamond, especially if it is cut nicely. Nowadays there are American diamonds, they look like diamonds, right? So similarly all these Asat, Achitta and Ananda are doing the dance of being Sat Chitta and Ananda. And then the living entity is attracted. And then it is attracted, what happens? Just like a firefly, or insects, they are attracted towards fire, right? Their own insects come, they go, so much attraction, immediately burns itself, suicide. So actually, when we are trying to enjoy this material world, my spirit, soul is committing suicide. Of course, soul is eternal, but at least for the time being, now we are all committed suicide. When somebody commits suicide, what does he get? A ghost body, right? So we are all got this ghost body.

In the material world ego means all, you know, something about negativities, right? We should feel Krishna's ego. Divine ego. What is the nature of his divine ego? All loving ego. All compassionate. Entire material creation is from that ego of the Lord. Of wanting to show his compassion on those who want to go back to him. And show compassion on those who want, do not want him also.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes the importance of chanting Hare Krishna devotionally, especially in the early morning, to experience the reciprocation of Radha and Krishna and the need to surrender our attention to the Lord.

Therefore Prabhupada says always chant Hare Krishna. Immediately coming out of the heart into the sound. Just like Krishna. Adhyatam, Achyutam, Anadyam, Anantaroopam. Similarly is Nama also. Adhyatam, Achyutam, Anadyam, Anantaroopam. In the midst of your devotional service you chant Hare Krishna. Then that is Vasudeva. Vasudeva is coming for you. Early morning you are chanting Hare Krishna, Hare. Nicely. Devotionally. Exclusively. Hearing. Not thinking of any other service. That time the Lord is reciprocating. As Radha and Krishna. Krishna, Hare, Supreme Hare, Supreme Hara, which is our goal. That is why it is not easy to lock your attention. As we become purer we will be able to lock our attention more and more. We should try to lock our attention. But nobody, Atashi, Krishna, Namadhi, Nabhavet, Grahya, Mindriye. Nobody can lock Krishna. You try to lock. And when he allows, it gets locked.

**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of waterfalls and different types of soil to illustrate how the effectiveness of Hare Nama depends on our absorbing capacity and the purity of our devotion.

Hare Nama. It is not a small effect. You do one Sankirtana in the city, it is not a small effect. It is not about how many people are in the Sankirtana, how many people are chanting. It is vibrating that together, that Hare Nama. Where this many people vibrating together is heard. The chorus is heard by the conditioned living entity and by the entire atmosphere. Not only living, not only the human beings. All the, you know, animals, insects. Only human beings can hear sound? No. So many can hear sound. They all hear. So in large, you have to understand that Hare is so powerful. Hare Nama is so powerful. Krishna himself. Only our absorbing capacity is less. Like waterfalls, clay will not absorb so much. Nice soft mud will absorb. Sand will not absorb. Rock will not absorb. Rain is same. Hare Nama is same. Whether you chant, Karmi chants, anybody chants. Hare Nama is same. But this reciprocation depends upon what is your soil or a sponge or what you are. Like a sponge. A pure devotee is like a sponge. Full rain will get soaked in. On a rock it falls. Nothing goes in. It will just flow away. Nama Prada. Nama Prada is, it all goes away. Just goes away. Just goes away. But there it goes away. Flows away. He cannot take anything. Nothing changes in his life.

### The Purpose of the Varnashrama System in Society | Sri Madhu Pandit Dasa | SB 4.14.18 | 16.07.2024

**Key Quote:** "The state's duty and the citizens' duty are very nicely explained in this verse."
**Summary:** HG Madhu Pandit Dasa reads and explains a verse and purport from Srimad Bhagavatam, emphasizing the importance of Varna and Ashrama for societal harmony and the government's role in ensuring citizens engage in devotional service.

Om Om Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 4, Chapter 14, Text 18. Canto 4, Chapter 14, Text 18. Translation: In Perpetual Vaisalaprabhupada Jaya, "The king is supposed to be pious in whose state and cities the general population strictly observes the system of eight social orders of Varna and Ashrama and where all citizens engage in worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead by their particular occupation." Purport: "The state's duty and the citizens' duty are very nicely explained in this verse. The activities of the government head or king as well as the activities of the citizens must be so directed that ultimately everyone engages in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The king or the government head is supposed to be representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is therefore supposed to see that things go on nicely and the citizens situated in the scientific social order comprise four Ashramas, four Varnas and four Ashramas. In the Vishnu Purana, it is stated that unless people are educated or situated in the scientific social order comprised of four Varnas, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra, then four Ashramas, Brahmacharya, Grahastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa, society can never be considered real human society nor can it make any advancement towards the ultimate goal of human life. It is the duty of the government to see that things go on in terms of Varna and Ashrama. As stated here in Bhagavan Etnapurusha, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna is the Etnapurusha. As stated in Bhagavad Gita, Bhaktaram, Yajna Tapasam, Krishna is the ultimate purpose of all sacrifice. He is also the enjoyer of all sacrifices. Therefore, he is known as Etnapurusha. The word Etnapurusha indicates Lord Vishnu or Lord Krishna or any personality of Godhead in the category of Vishnu Tattva. In perfect human society, people are situated in the orders of Godhead. They follow the orders of Varna and Ashrama and are engaged in worshipping Lord Vishnu by their respective activities. Every citizen engaged in an occupation renders service by the resultant actions of his activities. That is the perfection of life. As stated in Bhagavad Gita, yatah pravrttir bhuthanam ena sarvam idam tatam swakarmanatam abhyarchya siddhim vindati manavah: By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection. Thus, the Brahmana Kshatriya Vaishya Shudras must execute their prescribed duties as these duties are stated in the Shastras. In this way, everyone can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vishnu. The king or the government head has to see that the citizens are thus engaged. In other words, the state or the government must not deviate from its duty by declaring that state is a secular state, which has no interest in whether or not the people advance in Varna Ashrama. Today, people engage in government service and people who rule over the citizens have no respect for Varna Ashrama Dharma. They complacently feel that the state is secular. In such a government, no one can be happy. People must follow the Varna Ashrama Dharma and the king must see that they follow it nicely." Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the Varna Ashrama system as a foundation for civilized society, highlighting its role in elevating consciousness and the importance of adhering to one's designated division of labor.

So, the duty of the king and that of the citizens is explained here by the great sages to King Vena. As we have been discussing, Varna Ashrama system of social organization of human society is a system of social organization meant for civilized human beings. A civilized human being by following the Varna Ashrama system, he elevates himself into higher states of consciousness. The Varna Ashrama system becomes more abundant, by nationalizing inbuttocks and nuevos and opportunities. Vendra and Sahaja Yoga promote a realized life under the guidance of Varna Ashrama. Vendra and Sahaja Yoga. This civilization, of course, has collapsed. Our Indian civilization was based on this division of labor among different citizens. And then the king's duty is to see that the system does not break. Everyone stays in his division of labor, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishudhra.

**Summary:** The lecture discusses the accumulation of Punya (merit) through adherence to the Varna Ashrama system, even without devotional intent, and its potential consequences, such as attaining heavenly planets.

And this was the duty of the Kshatriya king. And if the population... Okay. He simply lives according to his Varna and Ashrama. He would accumulate a lot of Punya because he is obedient to the system set up by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if somebody is not... Okay. A devotee of the Lord. But if he follows this system set up by the Lord, even though he doesn't recognize, but he's part of such a Varna Ashrama society, he will accumulate a lot of Punya. And accumulating a lot of Punya, what is the result? The next life they will live in a different way. Okay. They will go to the heavenly planets to enjoy the results of those Punyas. Heavenly planets is packed with enjoyment because that is a place to encash your Punya that you have performed in the human body. Okay. So that particular thing of the population thinking that if I am following the Varna Ashrama system, I will get a good life, next life to heavenly planets, has no connection

**Summary:** The speaker distinguishes between simply following Varna Ashrama for material benefits and engaging in Daivya Varna Ashrama, where the goal is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, contrasting it with the Karma Mimamsa philosophy.

with devotion service. Devotion service is when you recognize that I am part of the Varna Ashrama system. Okay. So, I am part of the Varna Ashrama system that is designed by the Lord. And I live my life in strict obedience to the will of the Lord who has designed this Varna Ashrama system. So that is devotion service. That is called Daivya Varna Ashrama system. In that Varna Ashrama is not that, you know, Daivya Varna Ashrama system, Vishnu is the Ejna Purusha. My living as a Brahmana, Kshatriya in the society, everything is for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So that is how the great Indian civilization was. And even at that time. It's not that if Varna Ashrama is there, everybody is a devotee. No. Large part of people who are in Varna Ashrama, they are following because they want to enjoy. And in case they are ignorant and they do not follow the orders of the social system, then they go down in their material life into another form. Okay. They go down in their material life into another form of life. The lower systems, lower. So Krishna's purpose of Varna Ashrama, karma khandis may misuse it. There's a philosophy called karma mimamsa. It's always there. Just like Vaishnavism, that's always there. There's a philosophy called karma mimamsa. It's always there. They say where is the need for Vishnu. They say where is the need for Vishnu. If I do my karma, I will go to heavenly planet. So, I have to strictly follow the law of karma. If I want to elevate myself to greater enjoyment, they have no concept of pleasing Vishnu by following the laws of Karma.

Okay. But still, they know. See, just like to use the laws of material nature, you don't have to be devotees. Atheists, atheistic scientists, they utilize the law of electromagnetism. They don't think of Vishnu. Similarly, people know that if I do Punya, then I will enjoy my life. Not Punya to please the Supreme Lord. Certain acts are Punya. If I do that, I will get… material nature has to give me result. Just like if I know the laws of electromagnetism, it has to give result. Lord is not directly connected with it. He has set up a system. Same way, the Varnashama system is also like that. So, we have to understand that we are for Daivya Varnashama system, where Krishna is the center of the activities, the activities of Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra. And they execute these duties being situated in one of the Ashramas. Because there also, how to exist, what is the lifestyle is given. What is the lifestyle of a Brahmana? What is the lifetime of a Kshatriya? What is the lifestyle of a Shudra, a Vaishya? First one is the division by labor. Then a society needs intelligentsia, needs administration, needs economic activity and needs people to work with their hands and legs.

**Key Quote:** "Varanashrama system is for civilized human being. Because they are disciplined."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Ashramas are about lifestyle and that the Varna Ashrama system is for civilized human beings because they are disciplined, and laments the destruction of Vedic civilization and the lack of knowledge about Varna Ashrama even among Hindus.

So, we have, these are all division of labor: Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. And this Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, as per the system, they should execute their respective duties, staying under a particular lifestyle. So, Ashramas are about lifestyle. So, the entire human society, why we say civilized? Varanashrama system is for civilized human being. Because they are disciplined. They stay within an Ashrama. And they perform their respective duties as per their Varna. So, in this way, society also will be, everybody performs their part. The human society also will be harmonious. So, these Varanashrama principles are all given in our Shastras. In Mahabharata, when Bhishma was lying on the bed of arrows, most of his instructions was on the Varanashrama. But we know all now that a normal human being, even if he is a Hindu, he does not know this at all. He does not know what is Varanashrama. So, our Vedic civilization has been destroyed. As far as goal of life is concerned, there is no difference between an Indian and an American or a European. No connection with Sanatana Dharma.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Sanatana Dharma with Western civilization, which he characterizes as body-centered and hedonistic, and expresses concern about the influence of Western culture on the Indian population and the degradation of India's traditional values.

Our country as an association, our country's origin, the origin of Sanatana Dharma is from our country. See how much the Indian population has been the victim of another civilization, the Western civilization. And the Western civilization is totally body-centered, hedonistic, that means enjoy life, immediate life in this body. Forget. They have no idea of another next life they have. So, that is what today Indians also, they have no idea of what is next life, that there is next life, which is a very obvious factor to everyone. So, unless you know that you are not this body, there is a meaning of next life. If you think you are the body, the body dies, you die. This is the value of the Western society. No spiritual value. Because spirit is not recognized. So, it is very shocking that the entire Bharat, which had a civilization of Varanashrama, for millions of years, it has degraded only in Kali Yuga. In Kali Yuga also, it has degraded only later on,

**Summary:** The speaker shares a historical account of Lord Macaulay's address to the British Parliament in 1835, highlighting his strategy to undermine India's spiritual and cultural heritage through the introduction of a new education system.

due to the foreign rule. People were prosperous, happy under Varanashrama system. What was India's condition? Even 200 years back, when the Britishers ruled, a newspaper cutting of 1835, I will read. Nikolai, who was a British minister in India, in charge of education. And, any of you have that clipping? You have to search it in this. Okay. Here it is. Lord Nikolai addresses the British Parliament on 2nd February, 1835. This is 1835 newspaper cutting. So, what speaks in the British Parliament? "I have traveled across the length and breadth of India. And, I have not seen one person who is a beggar or who is a thief. Such wealth I have seen in this country. Such high moral values. People of such caliber that I do not think we would ever conquer this country unless we break the very backbone of this nation, which is our spiritual and cultural heritage. And, therefore, I propose that we replace her old and ancient education system, her culture. For, if Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good, and greater than their own, they will lose their self-esteem, their entire, their native culture. They will lose their native culture. And, they will become what we want them, a truly dominated nation."

You see, huh? So, it is this person who reported to the British Parliament. And, British Parliament approved his plan to dismantle the Gurukula system in the entire country. The Gurukula system where the proper Vedic cultural education was happening. And, they replaced it with this modern school system that we have now. Such a deep and highly valued system of education for human society, for human being, has just been destroyed. We should know all these things, historically. Exactly, they failed. Anything that is English is great. Anything that is English is good. It's all brainwashing done over hundred years. Your children are studying in English school. High value. Even today. Huh? And, people are shy to talk about their culture. Huh? If you take... If you go and stand today and, you know, speak. Indian leaders speak. They don't talk one bit about the culture or anything. Because, they're shy. They don't speak. We cannot talk all these things. Then, you are not educated. You should talk like a Westerner. You should talk Western culture. You should talk Western system. Very deep it is. We were all part of that. That conditioning is so deep. Even now, our conditioning doesn't go.

So, this is a story of India 189 years back. Big damage done to our country. So, that is why it is very important that gradually, these things have to come back into the society. They introduce English education. And, you see how everything goes 180 degrees, 360 degrees. It comes back. Now, Prabhupada's books are in English language. Now, we are reading this Prabhupada's book in English. In that English language which they, you know, brought into India to destroy our culture. Now, very same English language, Prabhupada is translating this wonderful literature, Vedic literature. Now, we are talking in English. We are hearing in English about Varnashrama Dharma. How to, how to bring back Varnashrama Dharma. So, the Lord is in control, ultimately. So, we preach in English. See how important Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati's instruction to Srila Prabhupada. He says, speak to English speaking world. English speaking people. Preach to English speaking people. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati clearly knew, even in India, ultimately everybody will be English educated.

Any questions? Hare Krishna, Prabhu. So, Prabhu, you said one thing that how the Lord Macaulay told that unless they feel that whatever is English is superior and whatever they are doing is inferior, we cannot conquer the Indian people. So, and then, as we heard that, how our Acharyas, they, using the same English language, is, they are preaching about Krishna Consciousness, Varnashrama. So, that is one way that is, that is happening, that has happened very nicely. So, should we also, side by side, just like, I remember hearing one lecture or some, reading some book, Prabhupada is saying that we should also convince the Western people that their culture is actually not superior, it is inferior. So, just like Macaulay thought that unless we Indians think that we are inferior, our culture is inferior, we cannot conquer them. So, should we also preach that no, actually, our culture is superior and, I mean, actually, I think that, that only happened that how Prabhupada proved them that your culture is inferior and, so that's how to change the culture. That's the way to prove that

**Summary:** The speaker responds by emphasizing the importance of presenting the foundation of Vedic culture, which is spirit-centered, in contrast to the body-centered Western culture, and clarifies that the goal is not to dominate but to spread spiritual culture for the benefit of others.

they are inferior? No. See, Prabhupada, he told the foundation of our culture. He gave knowledge. Every culture is based on some knowledge. Western culture is based on Western knowledge. Okay, similarly, Indian culture is based on Vedic knowledge. So, Prabhupada went, Prabhupada and our Acharyas, Bhaktivedanta wrote in English, Bhaktivinoda Thakur wrote in English, many things. They went to the foundation of culture and showed that your foundation is shallow, body-centered culture. Ours is spirit-centered culture. Does not matter, Vaishnavism, Mayavadism, Impersonalism, Chodavism, all of them agree spirit. Spirit-centered culture, we are. Spirit-centered culture, spirit-centered culture is greater because you are spirit. Body-centered culture means you are only caring for your life, birth to death. The moment spirit-centered culture means I never die, I am eternal, soul is eternal. So, my welfare means eternal welfare, not my interest in this life, short term. So, that is the difference between, you know, they had a very devious means of dominating. So, we don't have the concept of dominating and then introducing, for that purpose, introducing spiritual culture. So, some of these, our leaders have got it right when they say that we are not aggressors. You see, China is thinking one day the whole world should be China. America is thinking, Russia is thinking. So, they are always thinking how to accumulate more and more power. Conquer means what? Control. So, practically, you know, America is known to be the most powerful nation, was known, the most powerful country. So, see the spirit of, political spirit of those countries is to control the rest of the world. India is not aggressive to capture more and more geographical areas that they are controlling. That is not, India's thing is to spread spiritual culture. For the benefit of their own self, come to Sanatana Dharma. You are short-sighted about your own existence. Just because you have forgot, you, just because you have body-centered culture, doesn't mean you are not a soul. The truth is that you are spirit. And spirit-centered is Varnashma Dharma.

**Summary:** The speaker acknowledges the westernization of modern India but emphasizes the importance of Prabhupada's books in providing access to Vedic knowledge, which was previously inaccessible due to the destruction of the Gurukula system and Sanskrit education, and highlights the role of temples in preserving Sanatana Dharma.

So, the modern world is fully, modern India is fully westernized. But doesn't matter. Make best of the bad bargain. As we see here, these wonderful books of Srila Prabhupada. If Prabhupada hadn't translated these books and all, we all would not have become devotees at all. Where do we have Sanskrit? Where do we have Sanskrit? They have broken Sanskrit, no? Once Gurukul system is destroyed, Sanskrit education is broken. And all our knowledge is coming from where? Is written in what language? Sanskrit. So, the Sanskrit translation of these things, we get to appreciate, Oh God, this is not some mythology. Because moment you become educated, after some time you start seeing, because you have no explanation. What is this worship? What is this? What is this? All this ritual? What is this? You know explanation. And when you don't have an explanation, they will come and put, these are all mythologies. These are all superstitions. And they make a joke of all this. So, the Indian educated person, Vedas. Stay away. There is nothing in it. There is ritual, there is superstition. Actually, this was, in my younger days, in college days, this was among all the youths. But it has changed now. So, some positive things are happening in this country now. In my younger days, in my college, somebody came with book distribution, Bhagavad Gita, if they had come. And if all the, my friends are all there. And they come. If I buy, they'll all laugh. They'll laugh. Now it's different. Things have changed. Had zero value for Indian culture. Only our older generations, our parents were the, I think, the last. Then, the next generation became the parents they don't know ABC. They don't know our culture is based on Bhagavad Gita. Some Hindu way of worshipping is there, okay, worship Krishna, worship. So, in fact, it is these places of worship in India, these temples that have kept alive the culture. Kept alive Sanatana Dharma.

But, the Mughals, they knew that, Mughals had a different idea. Britishers' idea was to loot India and take there. Mughals' idea is to come here and make India theirs. Mughal kings. They would conquer, they will kill the men, and they will marry the Indian women. And they are allowed, so many wives married. Then they create, you know, more generations. So, if you see every, you know, Indian Muslim, origin you will go to a Hindu, Hindu mother. You will go. You will reach there. So, that is why they say Garh Vapsi. RSS has a program, Garh Vapsi. They don't say, we are converting you back. Come back. You come back to what you were. Back to home.

Any other question? Prabhu, so, I think, so as, now we have received this knowledge, so we should, I mean, not be shy and boldly actually practice. And, just like Prabhupada said, there are two kinds of Bhagavata: Book Bhagavata, person Bhagavata. So, I think it's, it's very important to also become person Bhagavata. So that, the face of the world can change. I mean, it's right, I think. What's the question? Question is that we should not become shy just like sometimes we are taught to be humble. But, while preaching, we should be bold facing the people. We should speak out with conviction. More than bold. Should speak with conviction. We should be convinced of these truths. We should have realization of these truths. We're not simply speaking from some book. These are all facts. These are all the unseen reality. Spirit is the unseen reality. Any other question?

Lord is unmanifest everywhere; everywhere He is there. Avatara means He is manifest in the material element. So we have to make people chant so that we manifest the Lord in our dimension. On Hare Krishna hill, in Rajaji Nagar, in this particular address, with ordinary ears, with ordinary tongue, material tongue and material ears, we are able to touch the avatar of the Lord. Thousands of people are coming to this temple. They are also adding, they are not only benefiting themselves by going through the chanting mantap, they are contributing to the welfare of the entire Bangalore city. How do we understand? These things you have to see from the perspective of the scriptures. This is a kripa of the Lord.

**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the concept of Avatara Shabdha, emphasizing that devotional service to the Lord's sound incarnation allows direct association with Krishna.

Hara is the seed of the Mahamantra. You can see the sound of the Mahamantra by the sound that is made up of the Mahamantra. Even the material, the sense of the Mahamantra, the sounds or the sound of the Mahamantra is made up of those 10 Signs. These are the three, and the names of these Four. Hara. Hara. Hara. To understand that we are doing the seva, we are offering devotional service to the Lord's Avatara Shabdha. In the Avatara Shabdha, the Avatari, one who is taking Avatara is present with all his Shaktis. Our perception towards this sound should be that of directly associating with Krishna in his sound vigraha. Mantra murti, the Supreme Lord is omnipotent. He can come into this material world in the physical form like 5,000 years back, or He can come online in the sound that you and me chant because he is omnipotent. So it is revealed in the scriptures, Kali Kale Nama Rupe Krishna Avatara.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Krishna is present in his holy names, emphasizing the importance of faith in the scriptures and the concept of the self-sounding sound entering the sound we chant, bringing all his shaktis with it.

So Krishna himself is present in his holy names. The more you have faith in the statement of the Shastra, the more you will feel the presence of Krishna before you. Therefore this is, this aspect of seeing the sound, but the perspective of the Shastra is called Shraddha. Because to your ears, it is, to the plain ears, it is sounding like an ordinary sound. But it is not. Krishna, it's a sound, Krishna himself has become that sound. It's a self-sounding sound. Hear properly, self-sounding sound. Hear properly. When I make a noise here, this is not a self-sounding sound. It's a sound that is produced out of clatter of matter, one matter hitting the other matter. Or the air molecules are moving and therefore sound is produced. Yes, the sound I chant, it is produced out of the air molecules. But into that sound enters the self-sounding sound. And who is the self that is sounding that sound? In Krishna's name, Krishna himself. So Krishna himself is becoming that sound and entering the sound that we chant. It's called Avatara. Yes. The sound that I produce with my material tongue is called, is the Avatara Sharira. Into that Avatara Sharira, the Krishna's self-sounding sound, his names enter that sound. When he enters that sound, all his shaktis also enter. Therefore, the sound that we chant with our tongue becomes Shakti Avesha Avatara.

**Summary:** The speaker describes how the sound we chant becomes Shakti Avesha Avatara, allowing us to access Krishna through our material senses, and how ignorance covers our true nature of Sat Chitta Ananda.

All the Shaktis, infinite Shaktis, it depends on how much we are able to draw that Shakti from the Shakti Avesha Nama. Shakti means Sat Shakti, Chitta Shakti, Ananda Shakti, pure spiritual Shakti. We are trapped in this material world, in these material bodies because of ignorance, forgetfulness of my Swaroopa, my… what is my real Swaroopa, what is my real substance? My substance is not this body of flesh and bones. My substance is Sat Chitta Ananda. I remove the coverings of asat achit nirananda, jadananda, unless those coverings are removed, my surupa, my real surupa, which is sacchidananda, cannot be realized. So the Lord is very kind. He comes as the shaktiavesha nama shabda, shabda avatara, so that with our material senses, the tongue and the ears, we can access, tangibly touch Krishna through chanting and hearing. Okay? And hearing requires mind.

**Key Quote:** "The sound becomes a omnipotent sound. That omnipotent sound is sent into our heart."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the role of the mind in hearing, how the omnipotent sound of Krishna's name enters our heart, burns away ignorance, and bestows transcendental knowledge.

So three senses are serving the shabda avatara, the chanting, the hearing and the mind. Without the mind, you cannot hear. Chanting you can mechanically chant. If your mind is, your attention is not on hearing, then you cannot hear. So hearing includes ears and mind. So Krishna comes down as his nama, into the namas that I utter. The sound becomes a omnipotent sound. That omnipotent sound is sent into our heart. Okay? And the omnipotency of that sound will burn to ashes all asat, all the lies, all the ignorance about my existence, I am this body, is a false self ego. It is not the real self ego. So it has to burn to ashes, the misunderstanding that I am this body. And that power is there in the satya shakti of the Lord. Chitta shakti gives us transcendental knowledge about the whole samyak jnana. Chitta shakti gives us transcendental knowledge about the whole samyak jnana. Let us look into this material world. Where am I suffering? Where am I always searching after happiness? Where is that happiness? The answers to all these questions becomes very, very clear when the chitta shakti of shakti avesha nama influences my heart. The Chit viewers, this authority, the eder in my greatest blessing, because today, I am moving forward backwards for development. Such Gunas should have no space in my heart.

**Summary:** Using the analogy of wet wood drying in a fire, the speaker explains how the holy name purifies our heart, allowing us to realize our true nature of Satchidananda and awaken our Shuddha Chitta.

Samgava, Samgapura, V авyāwal. Like this Prabhupada gives example, iron put in the fire. Because of association of the fire, the energy of the fire is transferred to the iron and it becomes red hot. Warmer, warmer, warmer, then red hot. Similarly, our heart is now just like there is a wet wood. And you put it in the fire, will it catch fire immediately? No. What happens first? The fire will evaporate the water, the fire will make the wood dry and suddenly when the wood is fully dried, the firewood catches fire. In the same way, Shakti Avesha Nama enters our ears, goes into our heart, purifies our heart first. That purification is drying the wood. That is the reason why even though the Satchidananda Surya has entered my heart, why I am not in bliss? Because the firewood is wet. Don't worry. Something is happening. You are wet. That soul is getting dried. Dry means, a complete dry means completely free from sinful attitude, sinful tendencies, sinful reactions. Completely heart is free from that. Free from offenses. Then, after that, the very same holy name, with purified our heart, which acted as an Aushadi, will act as a tonic for my spirit soul to wake up. Right now, my Shuddha Chitta, I have a Shuddha Chitta, the spirit person. Beyond this Chitta, material Chitta and material body, there is Shuddha Chitta. The Atma has got Shuddha Chitta. And that is where, the realization that, I am eternal servant of Krishna. I belong to Krishna. I love Krishna. Krishna loves me. Everything is situated in that Chitta, Shuddha Chitta. That Shuddha Chitta will catch fire. Then, my consciousness will become also, Satchitananda.

So, this is the process. So mercifully, the Lord has come down, in order to save us, from this ignorance of this material world, material life. And, this Nama, Divya Nama of Krishna, will purify us, and then take us back to Godhead. Purify us, not only purify, purify means removing the dirt. That is not enough. My real spiritual mind and spiritual senses have to be awakened. So, that also the Nama Prabhu does. After awakening my spiritual mind and spiritual senses, He is taking me to, directly to the spiritual world, to see Krishna face to face. For that, to see Krishna face to face, my Krishna Prema has to be awakened. My Preeti for Krishna has to be, my soul's Preeti for Krishna has to be awakened. We have awakened, little we have awakened, that's why we are in Krishna consciousness. But waking is a slow process, fully awakened is a different thing. So, when we are ready, then the holy name will give us everything. Total detachment, from illusion, and attachment towards, Krishna. So, coming to, practice of japa, soulful japa,

for all these things to happen, having heard, what I said, how it affects, how the change happens, the most important thing, to get the full benefit of the holy name, is to ensure that the holy name goes into your heart, and the only way the holy name can go into your heart, is, through hearing, the shakti, avesha, nama. You can chant any nonsense sound, and you can hear, nothing will happen to your heart, chai, chai, chai, chai, chai, in the railway station you can see, it doesn't get self-realized. Whole days, eight hours, ten hours you will chant, chai, chai, chai, chai, chai, chai, that shabda is clatter of, what? Air molecules. But Krishna, that shabda, Krishna has come. The limitless Satchidananda, ocean of Satchidananda is before you. So this is avatara shabda. All others are ordinary shabdas. This also, tongue, your tongue only produces this sound, like chai. But it becomes avatara shabda. Krishna's avatara sharira. And there's no difference between Krishna and any of his sharira, once he takes up, once he decides to descend. Associating with his avatara sharira,

**Summary:** The speaker highlights the role of shraddha (faith) in perceiving the Satchidananda present in the sound and introduces the concept of mindful japa, emphasizing the need to be aware of the mind's movements and anchor it to the holy name.

he is associating with avatari. So it all depends upon your shraddha. You see this sound with shraddha. What your eyes cannot see, what your ears cannot see, Satchidananda you cannot see with the materialized, material senses, but it is there. The surya of Satchidananda is there. So, first thing is, mindful japa. As I said, you cannot hear if the mind is not on the sound. That means mindful japa means you have to be mindful about your mind. What is mindful japa? You have to be mindful about your mind. Where is the mind? Usually we use our mind. When you use our mind, is one thing. Being mindful about using the mind is another thing. That means you have to watch. Mind has gone away from the holy name into thinking. Unless you are mindful, you cannot catch it and bring it back. So, mind has to be anchored. The rascal mind goes away into thinking. It has to be anchored, locked in the sound.

**Summary:** The speaker differentiates between thinking and feeling, advocating for feeling the presence of Krishna while chanting and hearing, and emphasizing that the primary task is hearing, not processing thoughts.

Mantra after mantra after mantra. So, locking the attention. Where you hear the chanting without thinking anything. Thinking is different. Thought is different. Thinking means you are processing thoughts. Chant and hear and feel. Feel the thought, Krishna is before me. Don't process. Process means you have a problem. You are thinking about that, how to solve that. That is one thing. Or process means you are analyzing the philosophy or of the holy name. No analyzing. Krishna is before me. It's a thought. Krishna is Surya of Satchitananda. It's a thought. So, thoughts with feeling should be there, but not thinking. Thinking means you are tasking something else. We think in order to task something, either problem solving or this or that. So, no other tasking than hearing.

**Key Quote:** "You have to take your attention and task your attention to move along with each word."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces the concept of 'tasking' during japa, explaining intra-mantra tasking (attention to each name within the mantra) and inter-mantra tasking (uninterrupted flow between mantras), comparing it to a yajna with repeated offerings.

Hearing means knowing the sound. Knowing the sound means you have to catch your mind and you have to task it. Means now Hare, Krishna, Hare, Krishna, Krishna, Hare, Hare. You have to know now which sound you are on. And you have to task. Task is a work, isn't it? You have to task your attention. You have to take your attention and task your attention to move along with each word. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Initially it sounds difficult, but our attention is very fine. Once you train your mind, on each sound it will run. As you are chanting, your attention will run with each sound. So that tasking, you cannot do that if you are thinking. Because then your thinking means your attention is on processing the thoughts. So mantra after mantra, you have to do tasking. Two kinds of tasking is there. One tasking is intra-mantra tasking. That means within the mantra there are sixteen names. You have to run your attention from first name to the last name. Then there is inter-mantra tasking. What is that? After you finish one mantra, no other thinking, but next mantra starts. Uninterrupted tasking. Then only it is a yajna. Yajna means repeated offering. Just like you pour one spoon of ghee, Swaha, Swaha, Swaha, Swaha. Similarly, on each bead is one Swaha, one Swaha, another. On each bead. On each bead there are sixteen spoons of ghee. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Swaha. This is the japa yajna.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that offering attention during japa is a valuable offering to Krishna, distinguishing it from mechanical chanting and highlighting the importance of a personal relationship with the Lord.

Tasking. You are tasking. The work that you are doing, taking the spoon, taking the what, ghee, putting it inside, uttering the mantra, isn't it? Similarly, this is a task of uttering the mantra and giving the attention. There you give ghee. In your other yajna, you give ghee. Here you offer attention. Attention is the most valuable energy of the soul. So Krishna wants that. That attention shakti is the most valuable. That is why mechanically you chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna. You go on chanting mechanically. Not very pleasing. It will help you. But attentively you chant. Give your attention and chant. Just like you call your son, call your daughter, you are calling with attention, no? Not mechanically. So call with attention, hear with attention, cry with attention, crying the names with attention. So this is very important that japa is to be understood to be tasking, not simply shravanam and kirtanam.

There is something else happening. Just chanting and hearing each mantra. You can say that is shravanam and kirtanam. No. There is an effort involved in offering our work. It's a work. I will not do any other work than chanting and hearing 16 into 108 malas. 108 into 16. I will not do anything else. This is a work I am going to do now. My yajna is this. And always have, when our japa stops being mechanical, when you know it is a relationship, Krishna has come down to receive my seva. Why my seva pleases Krishna? Not because he is waiting, he is starving, nobody is chanting my name, oh here one, let me go and catch that name. Krishna is pleased when you chant because now Krishna knows, my this soul is going to get purified and one more step it is, he is coming towards me. Every chanting pleases Krishna because every bead of japa will take us closer to Krishna and Krishna will never forget every extra bead of japa that you do. So it is pleasing to Krishna because Krishna loves each of the jivas and any attempt of the jivas to go back, he is pleased for us because we are going to stop suffering in this material world due to forgetfulness. Very soon this jiva is going to come to me

Intra mantra tasking and then inter mantra chanting. That means you have a job to do within the chanting of one mantra and you have a job to do between the mantras. What is that? Push out every other thought and go jump to the next mantra, next mantra, next mantra. Unless you are determined, unless you are ready for this yajna, you will not succeed in hearing japa, pure hearing japa. Our mind should be immersed in hearing the japa. What is the use of any thoughts? They are all useless. Krishna is a reservoir of all thoughts. The shabda is before you. Just hear him. All realization, this shabda will speak all chit into your heart. You don't have to analyze at all. Like a dark room, light switch is put on, immediately light will come. In the same way, all knowledge will come into our heart. We should become attached to this Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.

**Summary:** The speaker highlights that chanting and hearing Harinama is the real form of yajna for Kali Yuga, bringing auspiciousness and emphasizing the Lord's role as the best friend and protector, contrasting the Lord's personal care for devotees with the neutral kala shakti that governs those who deny Him.

And in this way, this not only helps us, this nama japa yajna brings all auspiciousness to the temple. It brings all auspiciousness to the whole Bangalore city. See from the eyes of the shastra, that this is not an ordinary yajna. The real form of yajna for Kali Yuga is chanting and hearing Harinama. And that we are doing here. So take this very seriously, each bead has a relationship, God Himself. Who is the most intimate person to us? That we have forgotten. With every living entity, the most, the best friend of everybody is the Lord. He is a protector, He is a maintainer. Of course, those living entities who are not interested in Him, who are interested, not interested in Him, but they are interested in earning themselves, everything. It's called karma. The Lord allows them. And Lord has His neutral form called kala, kala shakti. No feelings. If you want feeling, then Krishna is personally there, in your heart. For those who do ye etamam prapadyante tam sute bhajam yaham Those who are denying God are also surrendering to God. When you deny God, you have to accept kala shakti. Kala shakti will rule them. Kala shakti will maintain them. Kala shakti will protect them according to their karma.

Because of this, it is said in the scriptures that all the Veda Shabdas, Vedas are in the form of Shabda, right? All the Veda Shabdas, of all the Veda Shabdas, this Shabda is a crown jewel. You consider them as jewels, gems. It is also said that all the Upanishad gem-like verses of Upanishads worship the lotus feet of this Maha Mantra, this crown jewel of all the Veda Shabdas.

**Key Quote:** "So, we are worshipping Krishna himself directly. Therefore, it is important that we do not mindlessly chant and hear."
**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of avoiding mindless chanting, as it is an offense to Krishna, and highlights the Leelas of Nama Avatara in making spiritual advancement accessible.

Nama is inseparable from Krishna. Eternally they are unlimited. Krishna has a one supreme personality of the Godhead. So, we are worshipping Krishna himself directly. Therefore, it is important that we do not mindlessly chant and hear. Mindless chanting and hearing means our mind is somewhere else. While your tongue has been trained to chant, automatically chanting goes on, but the mind is on something else. Mind is thinking of some problem solving, mind is thinking of some philosophy, mind is thinking of some emotional problems, mind is thinking of some creative things and meanwhile your tongue is going on chanting. So that chanting, mindless chanting, only tongue is involved, mindless chanting. So mindless chanting is an offence. Naturally if God comes before you, if you don't give your mind to Him, is it not an offence? It is an offence. So, at all costs, we first have to come out of mindless chanting. Mindless chanting is mechanical, our consciousness is somewhere else, mechanically finishing the rounds, with no remembrance that this is Krishna before me. Because if that remembrance is there, it is Krishna before me, this Nama is Krishna Himself. Then naturally there is no question of mindlessness, your mind is on Krishna. So, we are developing this quality of worship of the sound incarnation of the Lord. Today Krishna is on this earth, doing His Leela in His sound incarnation. Because He is doing this Leela as a sound incarnation, that is how millions of people are making advancement in spiritual life, becoming devotees of Krishna and getting attached to the holy name of the Lord.

**Summary:** This segment emphasizes mindful chanting, touching the holy name with the heart, and the concept of the Nama Shabdha as 'electrified' with Satchidananda.

All these things are the Leelas of Nama Avatara and His pure devotee, Srila Prabhupada. We are all recipient of the mercy of Srila Prabhupada. We are the recipient of the mercy of this Nama Prabhu. As long as we think this is an ordinary sound, we will do mindless chanting. Mindful chanting means we have to give our attention to hear what we are chanting. And you cannot hear unless your mind is on the sound. Mindful chanting is very powerful. When you give attention, that is when the holy name you are touching with your heart. First you touch the holy name with your material tongue, the Shakti Avesha Nama Avatara. And then that sound, when it enters our heart, when we hear with devotion, then we touch Nama Prabhu. Because we are not the body, we are seated in this heart, the soul, the consciousness, the awareness. So by hearing, we touch the holy name of the Lord, Nama Prabhu. And Nama Prabhu, being Krishna Himself, and as we said this, repeatedly, Nam Nam Kari Baudha Ninja Sarva Shakti, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has declared that in that name that you chant with your tongue, all His unlimited powers are invested in it. So this sound is not ordinary sound. Just like an ordinary wire and electrified wire, both look same. But in one wire there is electricity, in another wire there is no electricity. So this Nama Shabdha's Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare is electrified sound. Electrified means not our normal electricity, Satchidananda electricity. The Satchidananda iced sound. When you touch electrical wire, which is live, you will get electrical shock. Similarly, when our heart touches the Satchidananda iced sound, we will get Satchidananda iced. Sat Chitta Ananda. Sat means spiritual power you will get. Chitta means pure knowledge. You will be able to experience Ananda, pure bliss, pure happiness.

That these three energies are there in this Nama Shabdha. So the challenge to ours, to the Sadaka is how to constantly hear without missing one Nama also. So that training, our whole training can be considered into just like if you take this as a school of learning Japa, then your mindful chanting is like the primary school. Spiritful chanting is middle school. And soulful chanting level one is high school. Soulful chanting, soulful Japa, level two is graduation, soulful Japa, level three is post graduation and any number of levels of soulful Japa. But fundamental thing is if you don't go to primary school, how can you go to middle school, high school? So here we are training first primary school is to chant and hear exactly the same sound.

When you touch the Lord and when there is remembrance of the Lord, that Lord himself has come before me, for me, you become joyful. So, first mindful chanting may be little tapasya, where you have to control your mind to hear every word. That also has got four, five stages, how from mindless, slowly you can come to full mindful. So Japa card 1.1 to 1.6, 2.1 to 2.6 Shraddha, 3.1 to 3.6 Vinamrta. These three cards are put together easily like primary school of soulful Japa. Then that will lead to Spiritful Japa.

We have to train our mind towards this, from Mindful to Spiritful. From Spiritful, later on, it becomes Soul… it starts as Soulful Japa level one. Soulful Japa, where every bead of Japa is a relationship with the Nama who is before you. Relationship of surrender, relationship of worshipper, worshipped and worshipped. And relationship of begging for mercy from the Lord. Relationship of accepting with gratitude that Krishna alone is protecting me, Krishna alone is maintaining me. Relationship of begging forgiveness for offences. Relationship of expressing gratitude to Nama Prabhu. The relationship of Seva Apeksha, begging Krishna to give you more and more Seva. The privilege of doing more and more Seva. Just like we began this Yajna by Seva Apeksha, begging Nama Prabhu, please give me the privilege today to do the Seva of 108 Malas.

**Summary:** This segment describes the goal of life as moving from mindless to soulful japa, comparing Nama Avatara to the sun and using the analogy of iron and fire to illustrate the difference between mindless and mindful japa.

So our goal of life should be to move from Mindless Japa, is like kindergarten, Mindless Japa. Some effect is there, even though it's of some effect is there, because Krishna has decided to come as the Avatara. Does not matter who chants. So some touch. So, Mindless Japa is like Krishna Nama, the Mahamantra, Nama Avatara, it's like the Surya of Satchidananda. So Sun, like fire of Sun, Sun is fire, Sun is light and heat. Huge source. Similarly, Krishna Nama, Hare Krishna Mahamantra is a personality who is unlimited source of Satchidananda. So that Satchidananda Nama has to be, when you start hearing, then it is Mindful Japa. Not hearing means Nama is before you, but there is a distance between your heart and the Nama. Just like if you hold a piece of iron outside the fire, near the fire, you will get some heat. If you put the iron in the fire, you will become red hot. So Mindless Japa is like standing near the fire. There is no comparison. Standing outside the fire and inside the fire, big difference. Similarly, thousand rounds of hundred or thousand rounds of Mindless Japa is equal to one round of Mindful Japa. Because if you keep outside, you may little more than room temperature, the iron piece will get heated. Inside it goes, it becomes red hot. Difference is not little between Mindless and Mindful Japa.

#### Memorization of Slokas, Intellectual and emotional memorization of cards, Harinama Prabhu as complete Satchidananda Krishna, Shuddhanama Shabda

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Just like if you memorize your Sloka, only one time you have to memorize. It's always, anytime you want, it will come out."
**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of memorizing slokas to explain how to internalize the content of the Japa cards, emphasizing that Harinama Prabhu is complete Satchidananda Krishna and introducing the concept of Shuddhanama Shabda.

You practice that. Once you practice that, you don't have... Once it goes into your mind, then you don't have to... Again and again, you don't have to... One time only, it has to go into your mind. Just like if you memorize your Sloka, only one time you have to memorize. It's always, anytime you want, it will come out. You don't have to go on, the rest of your life, memorize. So, in the same way, these cards, I am not saying memorize it, but intellectually memorize it, emotionally memorize it, what is there in it. See 1.1. These are, these cards, the content of these cards, you have to apply your intelligence, oh yes, I understand. So, intellectually, and some of them involve devotion, emotion. So, that also, you have to contemplate by repetition. What is the method? Just like you read, you read this card with understanding, every day for one month. About 10 times. It will take you about 10 minutes. Then slowly, this understanding will go into your consciousness. For instance, you should always bring, start japa, by knowing that Harinama Prabhu is complete, Satchidananda Krishna Himself, who manifests His sound form as Shuddhanama Shabda in the spiritual world. Krishna's Rupa is there in the spiritual world, Krishna's Nama is there also in the spiritual world, Satchidananda Rupa, Satchidananda Nama, and that Nama is called Shuddhanama Shabda in the spiritual world. This Shuddhanama of the spiritual world, enters the sound that you and me chant. And that is, that Shabda becomes the Nama Avatara. So, Shuddhanama enters the sound you chant and becomes the Nama Avatara, Krishna Himself. And that Nama contains all the Shaktis of Krishna. So, who kindly descends into this material world, in the chants that I utter, as the Shakti Avesha Nama Shabda, which is Shuddhanama's Mantra Murti.

**Key Quote:** "Similarly, this Mantra Murti, is the, it is the, this Shakti Avesha Nama, is the Mantra Murti of the Shuddhanama."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of Archa Vigraha to explain Shakti Avesha Nama Shabda, describes the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra as the crown jewel of Veda Shabdas, and encourages begging for mercy and association from Srila Prabhupada, Nithyananda Prabhu, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

Just like Archa Vigraha, that you see with your eyes, is the Archa Murti of Krishna's Satchidananda Rupa. Similarly, this Mantra Murti, is the, it is the, this Shakti Avesha Nama, is the Mantra Murti of the Shuddhanama. Because we cannot chant and hear Shuddhanama, with our material tongue and material ears, therefore the Lord appears in the Mantra Murti. Because we cannot see the Lord, with our material eyes, therefore the Lord comes as Archa Murti. So, Shabda Mantra Murti, is more accessible to us than Archa Murti. So, the very merciful incarnation. Now, this Nama Shabda, Shuddhanama Shabdas, the Shakti Avesha Nama Shabda, the Nama Avatara, is the crown jewel of all Veda Shabdas, whose toes are worshipped by the brilliant, spiritual, radiant, gem-like verses of Upanishads. The Upanishad Shabda, they all worship this, Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, as the supreme, because, the purpose of all the Upanishads, is to show us God. And here He is, Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, who has most kindly descended, through the Parampara, into the sounds that utter. We are chanting, the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, of our Parampara, which has come through, from Krishna, through the Parampara, through Prabhupada, we have got this Nama. So, therefore, I beg, Srila Prabhupada, Nithyananda Prabhu, always start your Japa, by begging to Srila Prabhupada, and Nithyananda Prabhu, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, please, make my, Japa, successful, today. Please give me your, association, give me the ability to hear you, I will try my best, not to, to avoid all offences, and begging, please grant me this rare, privilege, attraction, and attachment. It's a real privilege, to chant, these, holy names, which you have got, due to mercy of Prabhupada, and Nithyananda Prabhu. The rare privilege, why it's privilege, we already described, what is this Shabda, the crown jewel, of all the Veda Shabdas. Please grant me, the rare privilege. Please grant me, attraction, and attachment.

So, let me, carefully, and respectfully, serve, Harinama Prabhu, and Harinama Prabhu, the most, infinitely, most important person, just like, we have VIPs, VVIPs, you say, there are important persons, in this material world. Krishna is, infinitely, VVVVVVVIP, and He is coming before you. It is His avatara. So, instead of VIP, we can call Him as, infinitely, most important person. So, during Japa, what are you doing? The most important person, infinitely, most important person, in existence, because, He is the supreme, personality of Godhead. We are all tiny, tiny, tiny persons. Among tiny, tiny persons, there will be some, VVIPs, VVIPs, etcetera, tiny VVIPs. But, we are worshipping, we are serving, we are receiving the Kripa, we are getting the association, before us, of, the infinitely, most important person. I am, IP. I am, infinitely, most, important, person. It is not a joke, that, I am, IP, the infinitely, most important person, has got that capacity, before each one of us, on each our, japa, on each, on this, in the sound of, each of our, shabda. That is, Krishna's capacity. Any number of, avatara, sharira, He can take. When, His name is, when you are uttering, His name, then, that sound is, one avatara sharira. When I am uttering, on my tongue, again, He incarnates as, another avatara sharira. So, this is unlimited, omnipotent sound, is what is, before us. So, like this, by reading this, all this, whatever I spoke, you have to, speak to yourself. Say, for thirty days, you do this,

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of bringing someone to a lecture without context to illustrate the importance of understanding the situation and context of Japa.

one card. Ten, ten minutes, you spend. After thirty days, I will give you the mic, and you will speak, what I spoke. That should be goal. So, this is one point one. One point two, when you do japa, you should know, what is the situation. If I bring somebody, from the street, make him sit here, in the lecture, he doesn't know, what is this class, who is the speaker, what is this lecture, he will just sit like that. Mechanically, he will sit. Correct? Why? Because he doesn't know, the context. Before you bring him, you have to tell, that see, there is a japa, you will know about japa, japa is important, this thing, that thing, who is the speaker, what is his qualification, what do you benefit, out of it, what actually, is going to go happen. Context has to be there, then only, you will get into the, then only, you can benefit, from the japa. So, the second, most important thing, after expressing gratitude, to Prabhupada, Nithyananda Prabhu, begging their mercy, and after understanding, that this is a rarest, of the rarest, of the opportunity, this, the, this shabda, is a rarest of the sounds, after understanding that, one should, immediately, get into the mood of, what is the situation, what is, what is happening during japa, there is a sevak, you are the sevak, there is a saviour, one who is receiving, there is a person, who is receiving your service, and there is a service, particular service, chanting, hearing, tasking, that serving is there.

Afterwards, second time, third time, once you announce japa yajna, I don't have to tell about all that, you know, it is japa yajna, it is this. Similarly, this goes into our mind, as soon as you chant, you take your mala, immediately, in your consciousness, in the background, I am the sevak, sevak, saviour is going to come before me, I am going to offer seva, he is going to receive my seva. So, saviour is a receiver of, now, you see how the, you read this card, then, my mind enters the context, of what, etc., of japa yajna, from my subconscious mind, consisting of, who is saviour, who is sevak, and what is seva.

Second doing is, move the hearing. Your hearing should move. That is also doing. Second doing is, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Ram Ram, Hare Hare. As soon as you say, Hare, you have to hear, Hare Krishna, next, Krishna, Krishna, Hare Hare, you have to track, that is doing, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Ram Ram, Hare Hare. Word after word, nama after nama, should go inside. That is, unless you are doing that, you will not hear. So, second doing is, moving the hearing. Third doing is, tasking repetition. You repeat chanting and hearing, without any other thinking in between. Continuous, chanting, hearing, hearing. Unless you are tasking that, your mind will, after one, some air, it will go away. So, you have to task, continuously, okay, now I am starting my mala. I will not stop, till hundred and eight is finished. Then you want, you take little rest for your mind. But otherwise, only a sound, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Ram Ram, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Ram Ram, Hare Hare, hundred and eight times. So, that is called tasking. So, hearing, tasking, this is, this is, this is, Japa Yajna. What is, so, now, in your mind, you, you know, what is sevak, what exactly is sevak, what I should do during sevak. And, sevak, who is the sevak? That is the, spirit person. By offering on each bead in the mood of eternal servant egoism, egotism, not, but not, but now fallen. What mood should be the sevak? Sevak should be in the mood of servant egoism. There is a lording ego, boss egoism, and servant egoism. Humble servant egoism. You should, you stand before God, not as a proud man. You stand before the God, as God has come before you, your consciousness should be, humble servant egoism. So chant, the mood, so that is the sevak. You are the sevak, and you should have the right mood, of doing japa.

Like this, you read the cards, and understand what it means. You should read, see, in this, there is big letter, and small letter in red. When you first understand, you should under, you should read, all together, because then the sentence is complete. Once you know about it, know what it is, afterwards, you just see the big letters, you know what it is. Haan, sevak. Because that's, eternal servant egoism, is in the red line. Once you, see the big line, you understand, ok, servant egoism. Seva is the ajna of doings. So, that is why, I have written. And then, after you understand all these, in one line, essence is here, in the white box. See the white box, in that, 1.2. So, what is, the summary of it, is right there. I remind myself of, japa context of, seva, sevya, sevak. Seva, is the offering, simultaneous, triple doings, on each bead. Once you understand, these things, the essence of it, is there. This is how, we train our mind. First, you recall, what is, on the card, by, by reading, all together. Then, after few days, you recall, by reading, only the, big letters.

**Summary:** This segment uses the analogy of a train running to illustrate how to chant and hear by running the attention to each name, forming the full mantra murti.

Just like, if I give you a task, there is a train running, you are standing, on the railway station. A train is, moving fast. There are, the bogies are of, three colors, red, green, and yellow. I'll give you a notebook, and a pen. I'll tell you, as a train is passing by, each Dabbai, has one number, bogie number. As it passes, you should, write down the bogie number. Bogie number is not, in our example, bogie number will be, either one, one to sixteen. That's all. So it is, it is running fast. Your attention has to be there. Yes. Notebook, one, two, ah, three is this. You have to, you have to note down, the bogie number. The same way, Hare Krishna is like, a train running. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, gone. Hare has come, he's gone. Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

**Key Quote:** "Day and night we are interacting with the limited."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts our daily interactions with limited things and people with the unlimited nature of Krishna.

Japa Seva means it's our meeting with Krishna to give him Seva in this world. 24 hours we are continuously encountering, continuously interacting with different people, different situations, different things. These different people, different things, different situations, they are all characterized by one common character, one common quality: that they are all limited. In other words, day and night we are interacting with the limited. Let's say I talk to you, I am limited, you are limited, we are in a limited situation, we deal with limited things, limited people.

**Key Quote:** "Japa is a meeting of the limited person we with the unlimited person."
**Summary:** Japa is presented as a meeting between the limited self and the unlimited Krishna, a completely different kind of interaction.

Now get a feel of this. Japa is a meeting of the limited person, we, with the unlimited person. It is a completely different kind of interaction. We deal with any avatara, we are meeting the unlimited person, the infinite. Infinitesimal we are, and infinite is the Supreme Lord. As a person is infinite, we are finite with finite qualities. Krishna is an infinite person with infinite qualities, yet he can be finite. The finite is included in the infinite, the infinite is not included in the finite, and infinite is not there. So, this we should always remember that when we are starting doing japa, you are relating

This is from the Upanishads. So all the shastras reveal that in Kali Yuga, Krishna, the limitless, the unlimited, the infinite—infinite person with infinite energies, infinite love, infinite compassion, infinite attraction, infinite kindness, infinite power—that Supreme Lord is the ultimate. He is skilful. He is complete. Dhammakara isthem cursivata yagai deshasa. Liberated Rabbata side shantipata. He is the infinite. 혹ala yagai deshasa. Contactless. He suo Voyages. Vedic кадh. It is said Kali Kale Naamrupe Krishnaavatara. So in the form of his name as Shabdavatara, the scriptures have revealed the secret that God is before you as soon as you chant Krishna.

**Summary:** The importance of faith (Shraddha) during chanting is highlighted, explaining that without it, chanting becomes a mere mechanical exercise, and the Lord's presence isn't felt.

The scripture has revealed that I am under the nuestra. You are God. So this is called Shraddha. If you don't have Shraddha when you are chanting, then it becomes mechanical. You are thinking that you are chanting some sound, sound you are producing. No, the Lord enters, Lord's sound has entered that sound. That sound is infusing all Shaktis into this Avatara Shraddha. Avatari and Avatara, Avatari is a Shuddha Nama of the Lord, which is eternally vibrating in the spiritual world, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, eternally vibrating in the spiritual world. That eternally vibrating Nama in the spiritual world, He cannot be chanted with the material tongue or material ears. Atasa Shri Krishna Nama Adi Na Bhave, Grahya Mindriye.

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "The biggest secret is to always remember Krishna, Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto."
**Summary:** Because our spiritual senses are dormant, Krishna appears in the sound of the mantra, allowing us to serve Him with our senses and consciousness, fulfilling the essence of 'Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto'.

He cannot be captured by our material senses. But because now our spiritual senses are all sleeping, our original consciousness is also sleeping. Therefore, even though he is there within this sound, it is only by faith that we have to feel his presence. We cannot feel the presence of Shuddha Nama with our tongue, with our ears now. Krishna is so kind, knowing our limitation to touch him transcendentally, he takes Avatara in the sound that we chant, which is full of all the Shaktis of the Lord, the Chittananda Shakti. And through this Shakti Avesha Nama, the Shuddha Nama, Krishna receives our service of engaging our sense tongue, engaging our mind, engaging our ears to serve him with our consciousness. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto, Madhyaji Maam Namaskaru, Mame Vishnu Satyam Dev, Pratijnani Piyo Simhi. The biggest secret is to always remember Krishna, Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto. Keep Krishna always in one's mind, in one's Chittam, consciousness as the greatest truth. And that truth we can easily practice by always keeping Krishna on our tongue, ears and mind. That is the biggest secret. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu taught us how to practice Man Mana Bhava Madbhakto.

**Key Quote:** "Wherever my mind goes I go, so if my mind goes on Hare Krishna... I am also taken there."
**Summary:** Hearing the mantra is crucial because the mind tends to wander; by focusing the mind on the sound of Krishna's name, one is transported to Krishna.

He is by Kirtaniya Sadahari. So the most important thing during Japa, you have to understand because Krishna has come down as Sound. Sound can end your mind through the ears. That means hearing is very important. Now we are conditioned by our mind. We live where the mind goes. My mind goes there, I also go there. Your mind is here, then my mind, I also go there. I am riding on the vehicle of the mind, just like you sit in a car, wherever the car goes, you also go. In the same way, wherever my mind goes, I go. So if my mind goes on Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, I am also taken there, I also go there. Rather, we should utilize our mind to always go towards Krishna by chanting Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. So when you start japa, keep this in mind. This is a different relationship and a different activity than any other activity, which is all my interaction with limited things. Limited one, limited person is dealing with limited things and limited persons.

**Key Quote:** "There is no difference between Krishna and Krishnanama."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the limited results of karma with the unlimited potential of japa, emphasizing that Krishna's name possesses all of Krishna's qualities and is non-different from Him.

And the output also will be limited. That is the world of karma. But the moment you start japa, you know that no, I am now next two hours I am going to interact with the all loving, limitless, supreme personality of Godhead Krishna. Our mind has to understand that. The sound is unlimited, form is unlimited, his activities are unlimited, his shaktis are unlimited. And that is what now I am touching, that is what I am connecting myself to. Unlimited intelligence, unlimited beauty, unlimited power. Whatever, there is no difference between Krishna and Krishnanama. All Krishna's wonderful qualities are also qualities of Krishnanama. In fact, Krishna himself tells Arjuna the glories of his holy name. When he comes as holy name, he is more merciful, more compassionate. Just simply by hearing, you are able to touch him. There is no difference between Krishna's sound body or physical body. He can take unlimited forms. So Shabdakrishna is Purna Krishna. Like Rupa Krishna, naturally we easily accept it is Purna Krishna. Here is Krishna. But because of our conditioning, when it comes to sound, we don't feel that, Oh, here Krishna is before me.

I am the recipient of His protection.

beyond karma, so that is the kripa patra. Begging forgiveness for not being in proper consciousness to receive him as the sound, to honor him as the sound, to respect him as a sound, to love him as a sound, because of my strong heartedness.

Because Krishna and Krishna's name are non-different. So just like Krishna becameनं्ठित अपने कुषंड , Krishna only becomes His name, and His name is Shuddha Nama . Just like Krishna is all effulgent, sat- Chidanananda effulgence, similarly Krishna खुण्वजति नामाँ संत्रस्थारुह् नामाँ सच्छित्� bloomless child , Similarly, Krishna's namah, Shuddhanama, is also Surya, Son of sat-Chidanananda effulgence, Chittananda effulgence.

**Summary:** Chanting and hearing attentively transforms our consciousness by infusing it with Satchitananda energy, similar to how iron becomes hot by contact with fire.

Just like Prabhupada gives the example of how when an iron piece is put in the fire, the iron by association of the fire, the fire's energy heat is passed on to the iron piece and the iron gradually becomes warmer and warmer and warmer and finally it becomes red hot fire-like by transfer of energy. Similarly, by chanting and hearing, attentively, the Shakti Avesha Rama, our consciousness also gets Satchitanandaized by flow of Sat energy, Chit energy and Ananda energy. And the covering of this present soul, our present condition, the covering is Asat, Achit and Nirananda. So the Sat, Chit and Ananda energy that is coming from the Shakti Avesha Rama, the fire of Satchitananda Rama, Shakti Avesha

And the Lord is so kind and merciful that He comes down to give us His Satchitananda association. Just like Sun is surrounded by the Sun, the Sun is surrounded by the Sun. Just like Sun is surrounded by the Sun, the Sun is surrounded by the Sun. Just like Sun is surrounded by light and heat, so much of effulgence. Similarly, Krishna is Satchitananda Vigraha. His name is Satchitananda Vigraha and they are like the Sun from whom unlimited Satchitananda effulgence is emanating. So associating with Nama means associating with the Sat, Chit and Ananda energy, pure energies.

Krishna Chaitanya Rasa Vigraha. This sound is a vigraha of all rasas. Krishna Chaitanya Rasa Vigraha. This sound is an invalid. This is just oozing. That means all pleasure, all kinds of relationship with Krishna is a reservoir. Rasa Vigraha, poornashuddha nithyamukta poornashuddha means completely pure. That means there is no Asatha Chitnirananda. Purnashuddha nithyamukta. Life is finite to all forms that matter. That is why Raara is must. Ananda Incorporated with Nama.

**Summary:** The Lord gives us association through the Nama Avatara, purifying our mind through attentive hearing.

There is no difference between the nama and the one whose name it is. So the Lord through the nama avatara gives us association. And what does association mean? Association means just like iron put in the fire, there is a flow of fire from the fire to the iron, flow of heat. In the same way, there is a flow of Satchitananda provided we hear what we chant. By hearing, by hearing we need to give the mind. Only when you hear, the mind becomes pure. Mind means chittam. Mind means manas, buddhi, ahankara. Three layers. Ego, intelligence, mind. They all have to... Asat, achitta and nirananda are sitting in these three places. And when we attentively hear, this shakti avesha nama is touching all these three. When you hear, mind is required. When you chant, your ego is required. I am chanting. I am hearing. So in this way, attentive hearing, chanting and hearing attentively brings tremendous difference to this self.

**Summary:** The Lord descends in Kali Yuga through His Holy Names, offering a direct and personal relationship to each individual.

That we have to understand. Just like Prabhupada gives example, if you put hand in the fire, child or no, adult or anybody, it will burn. In the same way, very fortunate that the Lord has decided in Kali Yuga to descend in His holy names. So it is... That is called nama avatara. Should take advantage of this. Avatara means Lord has become accessible to us in the form of this secret we should understand. If you understand this secret, from this you can derive everything else. You will know why you have to be attentive. You know why you have to be respectful. You know why you have to be joyfully chant. Lord Himself is before me. If that fundamental shraddha is developed, for shraddha also, these are all the wonderful analogies that the acharyas have given in order to build our shraddha. That Lord is before me when I chant and He is before each one of us personally. It is not that the Lord does not care. Lord... The Supreme Lord cares for every amsa, every one of us. So you have to understand that the Lord is very personal when He comes on our tongue. But we are impersonal. So we should also be personal. The Lord has come for me. He comes for everybody. That's a different matter. But the fact remains that if He comes for everybody, He doesn't become diluted in His personal appearance for each one of us.

A big man comes or a father is having ten children. His attention is divided into ten children. Is it not? Even though, they are all my children, He says. But Krishna is not like that, the Supreme Father. Though everyone has a direct relationship with Him, in a general sense, oh, they are all my... mamaya vamsa jiva loke jiva bhuta sanatana all are your amsas, my amsas. He doesn't leave it at that. He has a direct relationship with every living entity. So we have... That is the reason why He has come on our tongue. No doubt, some people get benefit of this avatara. Some people don't get the benefit of this avatara. That is due to the causeless mercy of the spiritual masters, Srila Prabhupada, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's causeless mercy that some of us get this opportunity. Everybody can get, but some of us have already got this opportunity. Where we begin to serve the Holy Name, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna,

**Summary:** Repeatedly reflecting on the truth of the Holy Name is necessary to change our default perception and impress it upon our subconscious mind.

How does this understanding come? You have to repeatedly, you have to think about it. You have to do mananam. There has to be on these simple things, what few things that just now you heard. When you hear, everything feels good for you, yeah, I understood it. But it has to become part of your moment, you utter Hare Krishna. This perception has to come, that He is before me. So for that, why He is before me? All these things is what I explained. You should do mananam. Yeah, yeah, I can understand. I can believe. I don't qualify, but He is so all-merciful, He can come. And the shastra says He comes. So He comes, so He is there. I have shraddha, I have faith. That, many times you should think, because your conscious mind is fine, you understand that. But you have a subconscious mind, which has its own ignorance. This has to go inside there. Because normally when we hear any sound, it is ordinary sound. Now if our default perception has to change, that this is not ordinary sound, it is Krishna, you have to do mananam. Many times you have to tell your subconscious mind, again and again, this is the truth, this is the truth,

When you do mananam, it is the rational reflection, repeated rational reflection of the truth about the Nama Tattva. When you do dhyanam, it is emotional contemplation of the factual relationship between me and Nama Tattva, Nama Prabhu. Though we say, yes, I am eternal servant of Krishna, but it is not emotionalized. It is only philosophy. So, it is very important that, that emotional contemplation also is required.

relating with Nama Prabhu. Just like you see, someone is, man and woman are fixed for wedding, to be wedded. Then, they are in emotional contemplation. Imagine, living together. Relationship, nice, love, this, everything. Isn't it? Emotional contemplation. Or, you have got an appointment letter for a good job, very good job, big money, big salary. So, you are not enjoying the job, but you indulge in emotional contemplation. Oh, how nice it will be, my future, when I get this salary, when I get this, all these things. Emotional contemplation. Similarly, we should also have, for any relationship to become deepened, first is emotional contemplation. First is the truth about the relationship. That is rational reflection. That is coming from Shravanam. Shravanam, first you hear, and then, you, what you heard, you engrave in your subconscious, that is called Mananam. First you hear, Krishna has come down, Krishna is this, Krishna is that, no difference between His sound and Himself, all the Shaktis are entering, this is Shakti-Vajanama, the Lord is before me, but I cannot taste Him, I cannot experience Him, but I can experience His Shaktis, etc., etc., etc., all these things, you hear, what I said.

Shravanam. Now, if you don't do Mananam, it will just go away. Or a hundred times, you hear, different, different times, slowly, it deficits into your subconscious mind. So, you have to do Mananam. And then, Dhyanam. This is not during Japa. But, then there is one more step. Just like I gave example, then, when you actually get into the job, a good job you have got, then not all emotionally, emotional contemplation, with full belief and everything, you are now actually engaging with that experience. Earlier, you were contemplating that experience. Next, you are engaging with that experience. You started going for the job. You started getting the salary.

Chanting, hearing, tasking, moving the Mala, increasing the number of beads, and Japa, towards the target. That is tasking. Chanting, hearing, tasking is the activity. Three are activities. Action has to be backed with feelings. Thought feelings. Bhavana. Belief and feelings.

**Key Quote:** "Your consciousness is grounded with Shravanam."
**Summary:** A rich background consciousness, grounded in Shravanam, is essential for developing a relationship ego as a servant of the Holy Name.

So, not that we keep our background consciousness empty. Of course, it will be empty, if you have not done Mananam, Dhyanam. Actually, if you go on repeatedly hearing automatically Mananam, Dhyanam will happen. Mananam is stage two of Shravanam. Dhyanam is stage one of them. Stage two is Dhyanam. And then you practice that stage three. So, everything comes from Shravanam. Your consciousness is grounded with Shravanam. And we hear from Guru, Sadhu and Shastra, all the narratives. The narratives from Guru, Sadhu and Shastra, is what creates our perceptions about the world, about the thing, about the people, about Nama, about Krishna, everything. So, somewhere we have to start. Then what happens? When you Anushilanam, when you practice it, then you develop a relationship ego. I am servant of a realistic relationship ego, that I am servant of Nama Prabhu. I am chanter, I am hearer, I am tasker, I am serving. So, once that relationship is there, that is what, as soon as you take your beat back, your relationship persona with the Holy Name, along with its, along with his Shraddha, Preeti, everything that you have developed, that will automatically come. So, then every beat will be a relationship with the Nama.

**Summary:** The speaker uses the analogy of marriage to illustrate the lack of personal relationship many devotees have with the Holy Name, despite spending time chanting.

Every beat. See, just like I asked in one seminar, Japa seminar, how many of you are married? Many of them raised their head. How many years? They said five years, six years, three years, twenty years, everything. Then I asked them, is there a difference in your relationship between both of you from the beginning of first day of your marriage to second year, third year, fourth year, fifth year, sixth year? Isn't it becoming deeper and deeper relationship? Everybody said, yes, definitely. I never knew her, he never knew, I never knew him. But, after few months, relationship, relationship, it is deepening. Then I asked, how many years you are chanting Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. They all said, two years, three years, five years, six years, seven years. Hare, with your wife, you are able to build relationship. But with Krishna himself, with everyday, two hours you are with. Maybe in your, in your real life, you are not even, you are going to office, coming back, maybe you talk with him. Still you build a relationship. But here you are not building relationship.

That is how we are all able to chant 108 rounds. Because the Shakti, the Chesta Shakti, Chesta Shakti means the doing energy is coming from Nama Himself. If you don't hear, you cannot chant 108 rounds. At least some, you are focusing that it should be heard. Because I am going on prompting now and then.

**Summary:** Chanting with humility requires prior Shravanam, Mananam, and Dhyanam to understand and cultivate the feeling of humility.

This is Vinamrita Japa, chant with humility before Nama Prabhu. Now for you to chant with humility, you have to have done lot of Shravanam, Mananam and Dhyanam, what is humility. Otherwise it won't come out at that time. Humility is a feeling. A feeling if it has to generate, you have to have the thoughts, just like if you are angry with someone, there is a thought behind that anger. Similarly, if there is a feeling of humility, there has to be a thought behind it. And that thought behind it, philosophy behind it, you have to have hear how insignificant you are etc, etc, etc, all that thing, just see. You see the connection? So now whatever little you have got understanding of humility, you can chant today. But parallelly you can go on doing your Mananam.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses Preeti Japa (chanting with love), Atma Jnana Japa (chanting with self-knowledge), contrasting it with Yantra Japa (mechanical chanting), emphasizing the need for transcendental knowledge and detachment.

But today you can chant and hear only with the extent of humility that you have developed by Shravanam, Mananam and Dhyanam. Preeti Japa, feelings of love and pleasure giving to Nama Prabhu. In one sentence it is simple. But why? Because you feel love. When you know that someone loves you only, your love comes. That means all this, your Shravanam, actually Krishna loves us all. When that becomes a realization, automatic. So when he says, I am chanting and hearing, he thinks his body is chanting and hearing. But gradually, by the touch of the holy name itself, real self-knowledge, liberation of body and the self, all these things also in the background, your quality of Japa changes. When you understand that you are different from this body and you are using this body and offering this Seva, you are the real chanter and hearer. The Yantra Japa, mechanical Japa is called Yantra Japa. You are not involved. You are involved somewhere else. And you are offering Yantra Japa. That's also so powerful, such a big Punya it is. So powerful. But you don't get Bhakti if you do Yantra Japa. You have to give your soul. Because soul is what, you know, wants relationship with Krishna, not your Yantra. So that is Atma Jnana Japa. So entire, see for Atma Jnana, background who you are, who God is, why are you here, all these Jnana, when you read Prabhupada's book Shravanam, they are all matter, matters a lot in creating the background. Devotional service has to be executed in the background of transcendental knowledge and detachment. Something is required in the background. Knowledge, transcendental knowledge and detachment from this illusion. And then execution of service.

**Key Quote:** "When any Vedic statement is made, that itself is an evidence. There is no need of any proof."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that Vedic knowledge, originating from Vyasadeva, doesn't require external scientific proof because it is inherently complete and consistent, unlike fields like mathematics.

The modern mind is so diseased, when we hear something, we immediately try to find a proof for it from the scientific field or some other field. We try to bring some arguments to prove this Vedic statement. No, that is not the proper way of understanding this Vedic knowledge. So, Vyasadeva, who is an incarnation of Krishna, he himself has given this knowledge. I came across one theorem in mathematics. It is called Godel's theorem of incompleteness. One mathematician proved that mathematics is not complete and consistent. So, mathematicians themselves proved that mathematics is incomplete. So, by holding on to the incomplete field, how can you learn conclusive truths? That's why such fields of approach to knowledge, they are compared to holding on to the dog's tail to cross the ocean of science, whereas Prabhupada's books and knowledge are complete and consistent. Now, you can see the value. Prabhupada says, "These are not my books. These are written by Vyasadeva. This knowledge is coming from Vyasadeva." When any Vedic statement is made, that itself is an evidence. There is no need of any proof.

**Summary:** HG Satya Gaura Chandra Dasa reads from Srimad Bhagavatam, explaining how the Lord has protected devotees in the past and expressing hope for similar protection in the present.

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 6, Chapter 9, and Texts 23, 24 and 25. I will read the first two verses myself. Text 23: The Manu, named King Satyavrata, formally saved himself by tying the small boat of the entire world to the horn of the Masya Avatara, the Fish Incarnation. By the grace of the Masya Avatara, Manu saved himself from the great danger of the flood. May that same Fish Incarnation save us from the great danger. May that same Fish Incarnation save us from the great and fearful danger caused by the son of Tvasta. Text 24: In the beginning of creation, a tremendous wind caused fierce waves of inundating water. Text 25: In the beginning of creation, a tremendous wind caused fierce waves of inundating water. The great waves made such a horrible sound that Lord Brahma almost fell from his seat and the lotus into the water of devastation. But he was saved with the help of the Lord.

**Key Quote:** "This is why we cannot understand who God is or see Him face to face."
**Summary:** The speaker explains why conditioned souls cannot see God, even when He appears before them, because they falsely believe themselves to be independent controllers.

Thus, we also expect the Lord to protect us from this dangerous condition. Text 25: Ya Eka Eesho Nijamaya Ya Naham Sasarjaya Nanu Shujama Vishvam Vayamnaya Syaapipurah Sameeha Taha Pashyamalingam Prudhagisham Anina Pashyamalingam Prudhagisham Anina Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swamishya Prabhupada Translation: The Supreme Personality of Godhead who created us by His external potency, and by whose mercy we expand the creation of the universe, is always situated before us as the Supersoul, but we cannot see His form. We are unable to see Him because all of us think that we are separate and independent gods. Purport by Shri Prabhupada: Here is an explanation of why the conditioned soul cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, face to face. Even though the Lord appears before us as Lord Krishna or Lord Ramachandra and lives in human society as a leader or king, the conditioned soul cannot understand Him. Abhajananti Mamudha Manushim Tanumashritam Rascals, mudhas, deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking Him an ordinary human being. However, insignificantly, the Lord appears before us as Lord Krishna, and we think that we are also God, that we can create a universe, that we can create, or that we can create another God. This is why we cannot see or understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, Shri Madhvacharya says, Lingam eva pashyamaha kadachit abhimanastu. Devanam apisanyava prayaha kaleshu nastya va taratam yena sopitu We are all conditioned to various degrees, but we think we are God. This is why we cannot understand who God is or see Him face to face.

**Summary:** The speaker provides the context of the verses, explaining that the demigods are offering prayers to the Lord because they are bewildered by the power of a demon.

The sense of the Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada. So we are reading from the chapter title, The Appearance of Godhead, The Appearance of the Demon Vrutrasura. And in this chapter, we have seen a few shlokas back that Demon Vrutrasura indeed makes His appearance. And so the demigods, looking at His power, they become bewildered, and in a helpless situation, they are offering their prayers to the Supreme Lord. So here, they are mentioning some examples of how Krishna or the Lord has protected His devotees previously. So they are appealing to the Lord to protect them similarly this time. And so, here, in the last shloka, they are mentioning, although the Lord is before us in the form of the Supersoul, we are not able to see Him. We are not able to understand or not able to see Him because pashyama lingam prudha-eeshamanina because we think that we are also an independent controller.

#### intelligence, universal intelligence, ants

**Content Type:** analogy
**Audience:** Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "How is it that the smallest, the living entity that we see, is exhibiting such a powerful intelligence, and skill?"
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of ants, highlighting their complex behaviors like seed preservation and surgery, to illustrate the presence of a universal intelligence.

So that is the context. Actually, nowadays, it looks like there is a lot of research going on about ants. You know, the scientists are interested to understand what the ants are doing. And, you know, generally, ants, I quoted this example in one of the classes also, the ants, they save the grains for the rainy day, you know, for this season. So, when the scientists are analyzing, they understood that whenever an ant gets a grain, it divides that into two and keeps them into their godown. Ants have godowns, storekeepers, everything is there. So then they were very curious, why is the ant breaking the grain into two? Then they figured out that if the grain is broken, then it will not, you know, germinate. It will not become a seedling, a small plant. So, that's why the ants break the seeds, so that it won't grow into some plant or something and they miss the food. So that's going on. And meanwhile, they saw there is one coriander seed. And this time, the ant has broken the coriander seed into four parts. And they were surprised. Why is this? Other seeds are only two. Now it is broken into four. So they started analyzing. They found that coriander seed, if you break them into two, still seedling is possible. It can germinate and become small seedlings. So that's why the ant knows that this is a coriander seed. And if I break only into two, then, you know, it will not, this, it is not okay. So it breaks them into four. And then the story, in a rehearsal, the scientists are blown off. How is it that they are so intelligent? We also don't know that coriander seed. Ants have such an intelligence. Even scientists are bewildered. Then, the story goes one step further. Then they found, one day they saw one of the ants, fellow ants, got injured. In the day-to-day existence, they have very fragile legs. And, you know, whole body is very small. So then, one of the fellow ants came to this ant and found that, that fragile leg. Something gone wrong. And then, in front of the eyes of the scientists, that ant has performed a surgery and amputated that leg of the fellow ant, which got injured. So now the scientists are blown off. They are thinking, only human society has surgeons. Here is a much more skilled surgeon. In fact, they found that the fellow ant doesn't do operations every time. First it analyzes whether it can be cured by some medicine. If not, then it does a skilled operation and removes that little portion. They found that 90% success rate in the surgery. Other cases, probably they wouldn't have seen. 100%. Nowadays, I mean, not all doctors, but some doctors, you go with any problem, they immediately say, surgery. Cut it. But ant is not saying, first it will analyze whether medicine is okay. And then, if not, then do the surgery. How is it that the smallest living entity that we see, is exhibiting such a powerful intelligence and skill? This is a big mystery for the scientists.

**Key Quote:** "So, one has to understand that there is an energy which is actually working in this world."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the intelligence observed in nature, like in the ant society, points to a universal intelligence ultimately coming from Krishna.

Because, in human society, if somebody has to become a surgeon, first five years of MBBS, and before that you have to cross NEET, that examination, and then five years of MBBS, and then after that, there is a specialization. You know, you get, you become a surgeon. That is the, so, just to develop such a talent and skill, in the human society we see, it takes so many years, but here we are seeing, in the ant society, very, that kind of skilled operations they are able to do, and getting a 90% success rate. They were shocked. So, there is this universal intelligence. They don't want to accept, but that indicates to the presence of a universal intelligence. So, here, the demigods are appealing to that universal intelligence, Krishna, in the form of the super soul. The Lord, who is giving the intelligence to that ant, is the Lord in the heart, and he is the super soul, and he knows how to guide that living entity. So, that's why here, they are saying, . Actually, is creating, is maintaining, and is destroying, and, . , we are also creating but, means, following the direction of the original creator, we are also creating, and expanding the creation, but we are actually completely dependent on the supreme creator, that is Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "One should see this tremendous intelligence which is all pervading in this universe."
**Summary:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about observing a squirrel's quick escape from a predator bird, highlighting the all-pervading intelligence in the universe.

So, one has to understand that there is an energy which is actually working in this world. And through that energy we see creation, maintenance and destruction is going on, like in this ant society. So, we see the maintenance is there and very intelligently it happens. Similarly, once I was coming from Vijayawada to Hyderabad and then slowly I saw that the driver is doing like this, so I got scared. So I offered to him, you know, if you want you can take coffee tea or something, basically if he feels inhibited. So I offered to him, you know, if you want you can take coffee tea or something. He was inhibited, hesitant because Swamiji is seated behind and how can I ask coffee tea? No problem, you please ask, otherwise you will ask my life. Coffee tea is okay, much better. So he went there and then our car was parked next to some bushes and then it is just close to my window, so just I happened to see there is one interesting bird, not bird, there is a small animal, maybe squirrel type and you know it is moving around and it is doing something and at one point suddenly the squirrel became very, what do you say, alert, stunned and all that. I thought probably it has found me or something like that but actually one big bird just zoomed into the bush to catch this squirrel. Tuck! the squirrel disappeared. It just disappeared into the bushes and then there is some commotion and finally the bird went away, unsuccessful. How does the squirrel know that this bird is my enemy? Even sometimes we human beings don't know who is our enemy. How did this little squirrel know and that bird looked very unusual to me, not seen ordinarily. We see, you know, regular birds. Peacocks, parrots and all those things. This looks a little medium sized, some colors, very unusual bird and when that came, it understood that yes, this is my enemy. Immediately defense mechanisms, protection, everything came into picture and then it has protected itself.

**Key Quote:** "It's possible only by that energy. There is a different energy which is controlling these hands and legs and all my senses and sense objects. It's not me. I'm only seeing."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that our bodies are made of material energy, and we are merely seers within, with movements controlled by Krishna's external energy and directed by the Supersoul.

One should see this tremendous intelligence which is all pervading in this universe and which is actually controlling this energy. What is this energy? We all know our bodies are made up of material energy or the external potency. And inside this body, a living entity is situated as Kshetrajna, as a seer. So we see actually our own body also. We see the senses and we also see many objects. You know, for our senses, we need some objects to be seen. Those objects are also there and they are also made up of this material energy. So one important point is that since we are seers only, that means we are only knowers of the field. How is it that the hands are moving, legs are moving, my eyes are working? I'm only a seer inside. I'm simply sitting and I'm just coming to know what is happening in this field. And you know, all those things are happening. It's exactly like you are sitting inside a car and the tires are running and the brake is happening and so many things are going on. You're just sitting as a passenger behind. How a seer can move something that he's seeing? Let us say I want to move this camera. I cannot move because I'm a seer and that is seen. So when the seer is able to move, say I'm moving my hands, how is this possible? It's possible only by that energy. There is a different energy which is controlling these hands and legs and all my senses and sense objects. It's not me. I'm only seeing. But the movements are happening by some other agency and that is Nijamaya, Krishna's energy, external energy. And then this energy is not moving irrationally. Statically or without any discipline, a facade way, no. We are seeing there is a global intelligence. There is a massive intelligence behind the actions of this Jada energy. The energy which is otherwise inert. That is working wonderfully because of an intelligent personality. Actually, Shukadeva Goswami gives this logic. In the second canto, to prove that, you know, of course we are seer and the scene, the scene is animated. You know, we are seeing so many things. They are all getting animated. So that means there is an animating energy and that is the external energy. And the director for this animation is the Supreme Lord who is present as the Supersoul.

**Key Quote:** "If you understand that all these things are i'm able to see means i'm separate from all this."
**Summary:** The speaker addresses the issue of unwanted thoughts, emphasizing that we are separate from them as seers, and that identifying with the body leads to unnecessary struggle.

So, Nijamaya naha sa sarja. Sometimes some devotees, they get worried about some bad thoughts or some envious thoughts or lusty thoughts in the mind. They may also become very emotional about some bad habits which are pulling them. So if you understand that all these things are, I'm able to see, means I'm separate from all this. Say envious thought comes, you're able to see, you're a seer and you're seeing an envious thought, that means you're separate from it. It is not mine. It is coming up in the field. Why it is coming up in the field? Because previously I have put something there. It's only my own, my own previous actions. But currently I am able to see that thought separate from me. It is actually not mine. Only because we identify with our body, with what is happening in this body, we unnecessarily assume that all these things are mine and then struggle

**Summary:** The speaker stresses the importance of remaining fascinated by fundamental spiritual truths and recognizing Krishna's direction behind all energy.

and with emotions we make it complicated. So this knowledge that I'm a knower, a Kshetrajna, I am not this body, I'm a spirit soul, it may appear to be very routine and you know, we have heard many times, like yesterday also I was mentioning to some devotees, if we want to progress in Krishna consciousness, always remain fascinated by these fundamentals. You should remain fascinated. You see Prabhupada, what is his position? A Mahabhagavata Acharya and somebody analyzed what are the slokas that he quoted. Yeah, of course he is quoting for us, but he is ever fascinated by quoting those same slokas again and again. They, you know, they, he tells this in Paris, then goes to London, they know as many of the, he's not tired. He's ever fascinated by those fundamentals and he wants to give that knowledge to all of us. So these are the secret. This energy where we see a systematic tremendous intelligence and that is coming from Krishna. This energy cannot move, Jatakam. This energy, for example, this table cannot move on its own. These are all fundamentals. Somebody has to move it. Similarly, the entire external energy is a Jada, but how it is moving?

**Key Quote:** "Every conditioned soul thinks that he is God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that even demigods acknowledge Krishna as the supreme controller, while conditioned souls often falsely believe themselves to be God.

That is because Krishna's direction is. So the demigods, they're aware of this. They're saying there is only one Isha and demigods are all also, they're also, they're like two Ishas. They're saying festival, but they are saying you are the supreme Isha. See this knowledge, demigods self and then they are saying we are also post-bild intelligence creating. We are also creating situations in this world. We're expanding the creation, but that is, only because you are giving intelligence. Unless Krishna gives intelligence, we cannot do anything. These hands cannot move, this tongue cannot work, the eyes cannot see. A living entity is completely dependent like that, but why is it that it is not able to see all this? Because Eesha Maanina, the whole problem starts with this Maanina, your thinking. And what is that thinking? Every conditioned soul thinks that he is God. He may not really, some of the people, they may not really think that I am God, but as soon as one identifies himself with the body and he thinks that some creation he makes, and he thinks this is my creation, I did it, my creation, that means he is saying I am God. Only God is the only creator. Even demigods, they know that we are only secondary creators that too following the direction of the Supreme Lord, we are able to create something. So if the demigods are agreeing to Krishna's position as the sole doer of everything, now what about the conditioned souls?

**Key Quote:** "If we want to come out of the doership, then this is the secret. We should always recognize that Anusrujama Vishwam, my Lord, I am able to create this only because, you know, because of your direction or your intelligence."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that to overcome the illusion of being the doer, one must recognize that all creation is due to Krishna's direction, and that conditioned souls believe the world revolves around them.

So if we want to come out of the doership, then this is the secret. We should always recognize that Anusrujama Vishwam, my Lord, I am able to create this only because, you know, because of your direction or your intelligence. So devotees, they understand this, they depend completely on Krishna. And as Krishna permits, as Krishna directs, the devotees, they keep executing their duties. And while doing their duties, they get a lot of intelligence, insights, and those insights will enhance their performance, and then devotees become successful, even with little endeavors. Hmm. This is an experience of all of us, you know, we may be doing the smallest service or whatever, you are absorbed, you are dependent on Krishna, then you will see, you know, some insights, some little light, some flash, whatever you call it, and then suddenly our work gets completed quickly. Whereas outsiders, they take so much of time to do that. So, okay, now if somebody thinks that I am also a creator, I am also a doer, then what happens? The demigods are saying, we will not be able to see your form, my Lord. Now, this is the danger. Although Krishna, Lord is there in the heart, and when he appears, physically, he may be there in front of us, but the conditioned soul will not be able to recognize him, because we are absorbed in ourselves as the Isha. Every conditioned soul thinks that the whole world, whole Vishwa is centered around him. You know, when he gets into a community or gets into some kind of a group also, that self-prominence will be very strongly present in the mind. Things should happen the way I want. Things should be for my comfort. Things should be, you know, centered around me. I should get the attention. This is the thinking of a conditioned soul. He wants to become the cynosure of the eyes of the whole community. As soon as he enters, everybody should see him. Everybody should. And if they don't see him, he becomes dependent. He becomes depressed. He becomes very neglected. He thinks, oh, you know, nobody's recognizing me and gets neglected. So, that's because of his thinking, Isha Manana. So, the only

**Key Quote:** "The only counteraction to this Isha Manana is one single word that is called Seva on Mokha."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes that the antidote to thinking oneself as God (Isha Manana) is selfless service (Seva) to Krishna, which leads to understanding and revelations.

counteraction to this Isha Manana is one single word that is called Seva on Mokha. That's why, there's an farther meaning here. Does anybody know even that? Yeah. With the same senses, we are not able to see Krishna. How is it that, you know, just by Seva on Mokha, now we are able to see. So that is the power of this Seva on Mokhehi Jivahado Swayameva. No, this is a secret. The senses are same apparently but as soon as your attitude changes... ... And you become Sevun Mukha, inclined to render service. Then you will be able to see and pursue Krishna. This is a secret. That's why devotees, as soon as we meet someone, we try to engage him in some service. LLP preachers or whoever is in the field, they know, as soon as we go, we put some two Kaja pieces in his hand, and then the natural tendency in tuck he will put. Immediately things have started working. He is simultaneously rendering service to Krishna. And so you will see a complete difference in that. This is the way he deals with us. Before eating Kaja, after eating Kaja, you can see a stark difference. And we make them chant, chanting his service, hearing his service. So like that, when a conditioned soul is induced to do devotional service to Krishna, then he will start understanding about Krishna. He gets revelations.

**Summary:** The speaker discusses the various degrees of conditioning that living entities experience, highlighting how those in Satva Guna have fewer conditions and greater clarity.

And then on his own, he will take steps to advance, if he is fortunate. So, our particular situation is that, here Madhvacharya has mentioned that we are all conditioned to various degrees. Now, in each of the living entities, there are various degrees of conditioning. But everybody is conditioned. What is this conditioning? We are subjected to follow innumerable conditions in our life. And each person has his own set of conditions to follow. Like, we were discussing, I was discussing with one devotee, how, you know, when, for example, some devotees, when they eat, they have to wait for six to seven hours to eat. For seven hours to again eat something. But some devotees, within three hours or three and a half hours, completely digested and hungry. Where is the next person? He is very hungry. The condition for him is three hours, three and a half hours. And condition for him is six hours or seven hours. But both of them are having conditions. One may feel like eating whole day. Go on eating. But actually, no, there is a condition. So, like that, there are innumerable conditions. If somebody sits down and tries to list down the conditions that he has to follow, Oh my God, so many conditions are there. But these conditions are not same. Somebody who is in Satva Guna, his conditions are less. He feels more freedom. Free from diseases, free from all these things. He can also see things as they are. His knowledge is bright. And so, he doesn't get implicated in conditions, breaking conditions unnecessarily. He can see. Why misery comes? Because we break these conditions. We don't follow the conditions. As soon as we break, then the reaction is... The reaction is ready. So, that's why Satva Guna means you should see, Oh, these are the conditions. Let me adhere to it so that it's all clean.

**Key Quote:** "More discipline, more happy."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that devotees strive to rise to the level of Satva Guna through disciplined practice, which ultimately leads to happiness by avoiding future misery.

Now, devotees, after we became devotees, whatever condition we may be, we are trying to rise to the level of Satva Guna. When we take shelter of a bonafide spiritual master, Prabhupada, first of all, he gives the sadhana process. A regiment he gives where you have to discipline your mind and body and everything. Day after day, day after day, day after day, automatically the devotee comes to the Satvic platform. But this process is, coming to Satva Guna process is not easy. It is full of tapasya. Not easy. Generally not easy. Like Vishwamitra, to get rid of his passion and come to Satva Guna, what and all he had to do? But in our case, that process has been made joyful by Lord Chaitanya, by this process of Sanketan, Prasadam, you know, chanting and all those things. So, devotees, if they can apply themselves to this process, which is given by Prabhupada, gradually they come to this Satva Guna. They can see how this world works. And so that, you know, we don't break any of the rules of this world also. And then there are rules, conditions of the, even the spiritual life. So, a devotee slowly develops his knowledge, and tries to discipline himself by those injunctions. Shastric injunctions are Guru's instructions. So, this is the key point. If we want to become disciple, we have to be disciplined. We have to, you know, happily accept discipline. More discipline, more happy. Why? Because I am saved from the future misery. The future misery. Because, you know, unknowingly if I break something, misery will come. And so, that's why they want to be, they want to be very careful. Now, this big misery has come to these demigods. Why? Because Indra has killed a brahmana priest, Vishwaroopa, out of anger, in a fit of anger.

Just killed him off. Now, he is facing the result. What is the result? The consequence is that Vishwaroopa's father, Tvasta, he becomes angry. See, you have to see all this. Consequences means. Now, he does a Homa, a Yajna, and he says, he prays to the Yajna Purusha, that please give me a son, who can kill Indra. Then comes Uttarasura. And then to face Uttarasura, now again they are approaching the Supreme Lord. Let us say, Indra did not do that, killing of Vishwaroopa. No problem, no. They won't be in this miserable condition. Right? Now, this is one more important point. We should offer our services to Krishna in Sattva Guna. We offer our foodstuff in Sattva Guna. Highest, best quality. Similarly, we should also offer our services in Sattva Guna. That means what? When I am doing my service, I am not hurting, disturbing any of the stakeholders. I am not breaking any rules. I am not being cruel or destructive in my thinking. I am not, you know, this is the kind of thinking. Dvesha is not there. This is the Sattvic offering means. We cannot think, no, it's Krishna's service, I will do whatever way I want. And, you know, because it is Krishna's service, doesn't matter. No. Yes, that is Krishna's service, but we have to offer the best quality service to Krishna. Whatever is the best quality that we can offer. And that is the service in Sattva Guna. So, here, although demigods are in Sattva Guna generally, they committed some mistake and then we are seeing the consequences. And the consequences have to be addressed. Similarly, when we also do anything, particularly representing the organization, we should be very careful about the future bondage or consequences. And so, do a lot of deliberation. Do a lot of consultation before we do anything. So, by consulting, by taking all the help, still something goes wrong. Okay? We tried our best. It is the wish of the Supreme Lord. We can, you know, we can take it like that. So, that's the

The crucial issue is, crucial point is that the Isha Manana, thinking that I am God, can be counteracted only by increasing our service aptitude, wanting to do more and more, wanting to give more and more service to Krishna.

**Key Quote:** "As soon as we don't have any work, or we don't do any service, then comes Maya, knocks the door."
**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about the relationship between divine consciousness and detachment, explaining that a devotee absorbed in service is liberated, but Maya attacks when one is idle.

Any questions? Yeah. . A person in the Divine Consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, moving about, sleeping and breathing, always knows within himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because while speaking, evacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from them. So this and what you told in the beginning, are they related to? Yeah, they are related. Somebody, a pure devotee who is completely absorbed in the service, the service of the Lord, he gets liberated from this bodily encasement. That liberation is explained as like a coconut inside the shell. Actually it gets disconnected, although it is within the shell. A dried coconut like that. So similarly, a devotee who is absorbed in the service of the Lord, gradually he becomes liberated. Actually as soon as he is absorbed, he is in a liberated platform. But as soon as we don't have any work, or we don't do any service, then comes Maya, knocks the door. Are you free? Are you free? I am free. Maya will say, I am always waiting for you to be free. So then, we immediately identify ourselves as enjoyer. I am the Isha. I am the enjoyer. All these feelings, ego will come. Then that's all. That's a miserable life.

**Key Quote:** "Bewilderment comes only because when you think, I am this body."
**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about bewilderment, explaining that it arises from identifying with the body and that the counteraction is to focus on being a spirit soul and servant of Guru and Krishna.

Yeah. Any other? Prabhu, one more question. And in 27th Sloka in 3rd Chapter, the bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities which are actually carried out by nature. That and 5.8, both are related. Actually, although the soul by nature is a seer inside, but we feel that we are doing, and we also feel that we are knowing. You know, I am the knower, I am the doer. That's because he identifies with the body. So that is called bewilderment at the level of ego. See, one should know, mind is not all. Above mind, there is intelligence. Above intelligence, there is ego. And all these guys are bringing their own demands, bringing their own confusions into our system. One should know this. So in the mind, something comes. That's not the end of it. And don't identify with those thoughts and become very depressed. Oh, I am like this. You are not that. So bewilderment comes only because when you think, I am this body. Eshamanina. When you get that feeling. So the only counteraction is, focus on this fundamental. What is that? I am not this body. I am a spirit soul. I am an eternal servant of Guru and Krishna. Go on repeating, I am eternal servant of Guru and Krishna. Try to act on that platform. So when you can develop that personality, then we will be freed from this mental harassment. Otherwise, it is not possible.

#### artificial intelligence, Krishna, detachment

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers, Newcomers
**Key Quote:** "Devotees, we become fascinated and we become detached."
**Summary:** The speaker answers a question about artificial intelligence, explaining that devotees should be fascinated by it as an expression of Krishna's intelligence but detached in the sense of using it for Krishna's service under proper guidance.

Okay, last question. Hare Krishna, Prabhu. You were mentioning about universal intelligence. So because of that, every living entity is getting intelligence. Just like the scientists are like blown away about how the ants and other living entities are getting this intelligence. Yeah. So now, today, modern scientists or these people, they have created artificial intelligence, AI. Yeah. And they say that this is now everything, the world, the whole world is fascinated by this artificial intelligence and every gadget, every software is powered by this AI. So as devotees, like how much we should be fascinated by this artificial intelligence. Actually outsiders, they get fascinated and they get attached. Devotees, we become fascinated and we become detached. What is this fascination and detachment? We become fascinated and what is our detachment? Yukta Vairagya detachment. Not, you know, I will not use it, this is not me, this is not, no, that is not the process. Our detachment is, how can I use it for Krishna? Let them work very hard, produce AI, BI, CI, whatever, whatever they want, let them produce, we will simply take and use it for Krishna. The Prabhupada says, rats, they work very hard, dig big, big this thing and build their houses and meanwhile comes one snake, goes inside, eats the rat and lives comfortably. So we are like that. Let them work very hard, increase them and then, when they produce something, we should use it for Krishna. But then, Yukta Vairagya has to be done under guidance, careful guidance. Yukta Vairagya is like going to a pond for fishing. So you are thinking, oh, I will get you know, nice fish, I can catch, using this technology, I can catch somebody. Using this, I can catch somebody, you know, we are going and trying to catch the fish. The problem is, when you put this bite and you are waiting, something has come. Let us say, it is not fish but it is a Timingula. You will be pulled in and you will be swallowed. So when we are doing this Yukta Vairagya of this technology and we are trying to catch somebody, but Maya comes to catch you. Yes, yes, yes, come. So that is why we should be very careful. Under the direction of older devotees and seniors, we should utilize this. So we are also fascinated because this is intelligence of the Lord. Our body is nothing but a robot. Inside the body we are there as seers. So they will come to robotic technology, they will come to all this, but they can never manufacture a soul. They cannot manufacture consciousness. Now they are doing innumerable researches on what is this consciousness. They are also now talking. They are thinking consciousness is a brain phenomena and they are going in that direction. So, we should be very careful about this. So, anyway, that's, so, yes, we are also excited because we see Krishna's intelligence and, but, our thinking is how can I use it for Krishna? Anu, Anusrjama, Anu means following, following the direction of the authorities, Guru and Krishna, we can engage anything in this world in the service of the Lord. And, I am saying universal intelligence because the ant knows that the grain is an eatable. A snake also knows. If you pour a little milk, snake comes or a cat can come or any other Jeeva, they all know this is my food. It's a uniform intelligence. Everybody knows that these are all my eatables. So, universal intelligence, that is, that's why we see there is a, some understanding of what is my food, what is my enemy, everything. So, it's not a, what to say, somehow, by chance, you know, it has developed some intelligence like that. We see there is all pervading intelligence. A uniform, commonly understood intelligence is also there. We can see that. So, that's why it is coming from one single personality and that is Supersoul or the Krishna.

### How Can I Identify Which Mode of Nature (Guna) Is Influencing Me? | Sri Satya Gaura Chandra Dasa
**Speaker:** HG Satya Gaura Chandra Dasa

#### modes of nature, self-awareness, body as a yantra

**Key Quote:** "We are not this body, but we cannot be ignorant of this body."
**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the influence of the modes of nature on our body and mind, referring to the body as a 'yantra' that needs to be trained.

But in a devotee's life, how do we know that we are in which mode? How do we reflect that I am being conducted by which mode, whether I am too much passionate, or I am under ignorance, or I am in sattva guna, or like, how do we reflect, how do we know our standing, which mode we are conducted? Actually, it is very important to understand that we are in which mode. To understand our own body and mind, our own, you know, this yantra, very important. We are not this body, but we cannot be ignorant of this body because this yantra influences us every moment, every, all the places, this yantra is continuously influencing us. And because the yantra was trained up for millions of years towards sense gratification, towards supremacy, towards possessing many things, it is important that we have to know what is this sadhana bhakti, nothing but training this yantra. You have to matter of duty means you're training this yantra, yes, you have to attend sadhana, you have to do your duty. It creates a lot of illusions. So that's why we should not be in ignorance about our own body.

#### eating habits, Krishna consciousness, prasadam, sense control

**Verse References:** —
**Content Type:** practical
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "If your vision is that you are seeing chillis and tamarind and this and that, you should eat."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses how to understand the modes of nature through our eating habits, emphasizing the importance of Krishna consciousness while eating prasadam and understanding how different foods affect our senses.

We have to gradually understand where I stand. And so I would say that education about understanding ourselves, I would say it begins with our eating habits. It begins with the tongue, our devotional service. So it is good. It is good to understand our eating habits, whether I am this food, whether it is suiting me or it is not suiting me, what disturbs my, you know, consciousness. See actually, prashadam, if we properly honor with Krishna consciousness, there's no question of, you know, any trouble. But the problem with us is there is no Krishna consciousness while eating. We just eat like a normal, you know, normal eating and there is no consciousness maintained that this is Krishna's mercy and it's a transcendental food. There is no such either thinking, there is no realization like that. So that's why we have to be careful to understand. Like Prabhupada was asked by that Bob in the book. He says, let us say, if there is a chili, Prabhupada was explaining that whatever is there in the plate you should eat. Everything is prashad. Then he is asking, if there is a chili then if it is, you know, for me it is. Then Prabhupada says, if your vision is that you are seeing chillis and tamarind and this and that, you should eat. You cannot artificially imitate a higher platform that it's all Brahman, it's a transcendent, it's Krishna's mercy. These things are not there. So then yes, you have to be careful. You have to understand what suits you and what doesn't suit you. What agitates your senses and what doesn't. And let us say if I eat many sweets in the night or if I overeat in the night, it has certain repercussions, we should understand. If you eat too much of paneer, then you may get sexually agitated, that you have to understand.

#### health, eating habits, sattvic diet, self-awareness

**Key Quote:** "By carefully understanding our body, what suits and what not suits, we can keep our bodily thing little on a sattvic platform."
**Summary:** The speaker continues discussing the importance of understanding our body and its reactions to food, emphasizing the need for a sattvic diet to maintain health and facilitate devotional service.

And also let us say we are falling sick too many times and we have to see whether it has any correlation with the food that I am eating. I am taking my food habits. For example, it is said that we should eat only when we are very hungry. That means the previous food is already digested. Here, you cannot walk into the Ashram Prasadam hall just like that and then, okay, agaya. You can go inside and so take one more plate of food and then your previously morning breakfast is not digested and you are not still feeling hungry and then you load another one more plate. So this, of course, this is called overeating and it has its own serious implications. So gradually devotee, because he is chanting and performing devotional service, he is able to see, you know. All these implications on his consciousness, how the body is trying to pull him down, he understands. And so gradually he rectifies all those things. So, coming to some kind of a sattvic level in our eating habits is very important. Very, very important. Of course, in the beginning days we can eat well and it gets digested also. But as we grow older, you have to reduce the quantities, number of times and what type of items. Let us say somebody is not very careful about eating sweets, for example. As we grow older, it can lead to many other complications. Of course, nowadays diabetes, not only by sweets, by many other reasons it is coming into the... Now so many diseases are coming. Even youngsters, they are also having a lot of diseases. So very unfortunate. So by carefully understanding our body, what suits and what not suits, we can keep our bodily thing little on a sattvic platform.

**Summary:** The speaker shares an anecdote about a young man with multiple health issues and then discusses how the modes of nature influence our work ethic, particularly procrastination (ignorance) and the desire for recognition (passion).

One boy joined in Hyderabad. He was, he is just 18 years. And in the application, joining form, we ask, you know, you mention if you have any health issues. And so, you know, he came for interview. And then I was going through his form. And then I came to this page where he has mentioned all his health issues. And I counted those health issues. He is having 18. 18 years and 18. I said, if you become 25, what will happen to you? What will happen to you? Will it become 25 or is it going to be something less? Very unfortunate in the outside world because they have no idea of managing their eating habits, sleeping habits and all this. So we have to start as basic as that. And then gradually improve our... For example, with respect to work. You can see. When I have to do, let us say the immediate tendency is to postpone the work. That means ignorance is acting. Ignorant person only postpones. He has got a procrastination. Any time when you want to do some work, immediately mind says, No, not now. Later, later, later. So then you know, okay, ignorance is trying to influence me. Or... Or you have a lot of energy to do. But in the end, you are expecting that somebody should recognize me. Somebody should say, yes. Very good. Or at the end of some few years, Yes, I need some designation. No expectation. It may come on its own. You take that as prasadam and go on. But... You are not building up any hankering for it. Like that. This is one more important. So like that gradually you will see.

So regular reading, regular association with Vaishnavas. That is the only remedy. Nicely read and analyze and analyze and how I can take out all the wrong understandings so that I can become a better devotee. This is the goal of our life. And particularly for missionaries, such a wonderful opportunity. We can read. We can spend time. Sometimes, okay, our services may be there. We are very busy. Even then, we should not neglect our reading at least. Every day something should go inside. And that is the... What do you call...

### How Did Mother Sita Nurture Luv and Kush? | Sri Sampati Dasa

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Sita prepared love and kush to go and sing the greatness of Ram's character."
**Summary:** The speaker argues that Sita's upbringing of Luv and Kush, teaching them to glorify Rama, demonstrates her unwavering devotion and understanding of Dharma, contrasting it with modern examples of parental alienation.

If Sita was angry and upset with Shri Ram, asking why Ram abandoned me to the forest, she would have made Lava and Kush feel against Shri Ram. This is not the truth. If Sita was unhappy that Ram abandoned her to the forest just because some common people were making some allegations against her, this is not the truth. She was not angry and upset with Shri Ram's decision. It is visible in the way she brought up Lava and Kush. Lava and Kush are the first Katha Vachaks. They are the first people to speak Ramayana, Valmiki Ramayana. They were going everywhere, every village, nook and corner of Ayodhya, and they were singing the glories of Lord Shri. If Sita was angry and upset with Shri Ram, with his decision, obviously she must have poisoned the children of Shri Ram. She would have made Lava and Kush feel against Shri Ram. Rather, she made them learn the glories of Shri Ram. That shows that Sita always carried love for Shri Ram. She understood the Dharma Sankat of Shri Ram. She was completely okay with Ram's decision because she did not poison the minds of Lava and Kush. Today we see when there is a fight between husband and wife, and there is some kind of injustice and there is divorce, sometimes the father tries to poison the minds of children against the mother, or the mother tries to poison the children's mind against the father. But that's not the case in Ramayana. Sita prepared Lava and Kush to go and sing the greatness of Ram's character. That is Ramayana. So Lava and Kush, they never carried any grudge against their father Shri Ram. They were very happy. They always felt that Ram is the greatest father. So that...

Their idea is that eating means God will eat the way I eat. We eat, we complete the whole plate, but God's eating is not that. His eating is very fine. It is said that even if the Lord glances on the food, that turns into Prasadam, and on that Prasadam we eat, remembering.

We always see such powerful, intelligent, smart followers like Hanuman sitting at the lotus feet of Lord Ram, because Lord Ram is such a great leader. So if you want good followers, be a good leader first.

**Key Quote:** "Lord Ram teaches the importance of being truthful and honoring the promise and being respectful towards our own words."
**Summary:** Lord Rama is presented as the greatest leader because he sacrificed his kingdom to honor his father's promise, demonstrating truthfulness and integrity.

We cannot think of a leader who does not keep up his own words, who breaks the promises, right? We do not definitely like to choose such a leader. Ram is the greatest leader for the followers. He is the greatest leader for the entire human civilization because he took immense trouble, he went through tribulation just to keep up his promise, his family promise, his father's promise by giving away Ayodhya to his stepmother Kaikeyi and making Bharat as a king of Ayodhya. Ram could have easily become the king of Ayodhya, but he wanted to honor the words of his father, Dasharatha Maharaj. For that, he happily gave up Ayodhya and went to forest. Lord Ram teaches the importance of being truthful and honoring the promise and being respectful towards our own words.

**Key Quote:** "You must always, always walk the talk."
**Summary:** Lord Rama teaches that leaders must keep their promises, maintain integrity, and align their actions with their words to maintain credibility and inspire followers.

The moment the leader makes a promise, he must make all efforts to keep up his promise. Otherwise, the followers will question the credibility of your leadership. They may lose faith in your leadership because, oh, you say something, but you are not intending to follow your own promise. So Lord Ram is teaching a very important lesson to all the leaders, saying that no matter how difficult it is, no matter how troublesome in your own personal life, you must keep up your words. You must have a virtue, a value called integrity. There must be absolutely no gap between your action and your words. You must always, always walk the talk. And Lord Ram is an example for somebody who always walked what he talked. So that is the lesson Lord Ram teaches as a hero.

**Summary:** The speaker contrasts Lord Rama's use of power with Wali, who abused his power by attacking his own brother Sugreeva.

Because being powerful, he never misused his power in any manner. We see an example of Wali, a very powerful person, king of Kishkindha. What did he do with his power and position? He attacked his own younger brother Sugreeva. He threw him out of Kishkindha. Sugreeva was a loyal citizen of Kishkindha. He was a contributing citizen of Kishkindha. But Wali, being angry and out of a certain misunderstanding, he attacked his own younger brother. And he used his power and position to make an effort to murder, kill Sugreeva.

Lord Ram uses his power always to help the weaker section of society. Those who are being attacked, they will take shelter of Lord Shri Ram. Lord Shri Ram helped Sugreeva by killing Wali. He made Sugreeva the king of Kishkindha. Lord Ram is not thinking, "I'm very powerful. I will defeat Wali and I will become the king of Kishkindha." Even though he killed Wali, he defeated Wali. Lord Ram did not become the king of Kishkindha.

**Summary:** Lord Rama is presented as a leader who empowers others and uses his power to protect the vulnerable, serving as an inspiration for all leaders.

He made Sugreeva the king of Kishkindha. So here we see Lord Ram as somebody who is not greedy for power. He is somebody who makes his followers leaders. He is somebody who creates more leaders. He is not somebody who says that I should be the only one who is the greatest. I should be the only one who is the king. I should be the only one who is powerful. He likes creating more powerful, more leaders under him and especially uses his power to help those who are the weaker section of society, like Sugreeva, who was in trouble because of somebody like Wali who was abusing power. That's why Lord Shri Ram is an inspirational figure for all the leaders to learn the lesson of how to use power, for what purpose we use power in our life. That's why Lord Shri Ram is an inspirational figure for all the leaders to learn the lesson of how to use power in our life.

### The Duties & Qualities of a Brahmana | Sri Vigraha Dasa | SB 1.18.34 | 11.08.2024

#### Shringi's curse, Brahmana's role, False prestige

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "He compared the king to a watchdog and so it was wrong for the king to enter the home of a brahmana and ask for water from the same pot."
**Summary:** The speaker reads and explains a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam about Shringi cursing King Parikshit, highlighting Shringi's inappropriate comparison of the king to a dog and the false prestige associated with being a Brahmana.

Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1, Creation, Chapter 18, Entitled Parikshit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy, Text 34 Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada Translation Shringi continued to say The descendants of the kingly orders are definitely designated as watchdogs and they must keep themselves at the door. On what grounds can dogs enter the house and claim to dine with the master on the same plate? Purport by Srila Prabhupada Parikshit Cursed by a Brahmana Boy, Text 34 Translation and purport by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada Certainly knew that the king asked for water from his father and the father did not respond. He tried to explain away his father's inhospitality in an impertinent manner, befitting an uncultured boy. He was not at all sorry for the king's not being well received. On the contrary, he justified the wrong act in a way characteristically, of the brahmanas of Kali Yuga. He compared the king to a watchdog and so it was wrong for the king to enter the home of a brahmana and ask for water from the same pot. The dog is certainly reared by its master but that does not mean that the dog shall claim to dine and drink from the same pot. This mentality of false prestige, is the cause of downfall of the perfect social order. And we can see that, in the beginning it was started by the inexperienced son of a brahmana. As the dog is never allowed to enter within the room and hearth, although it is reared by the master, similarly, according to Shringi, the king had no right to enter the house of Shamika Rishi. The king was not allowed to enter the house of Shamika Rishi. According to the boy's opinion, the king was on the wrong side and not his father and thus, he justified his silent father.

**Key Quote:** "And without asking, Krishna gives unlimited wealth, to Sudama."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts a play about friendship, contrasting the material friendship of Drona and Drupada with the spiritual friendship of Krishna and Sudama, emphasizing Krishna's unconditional generosity.

So, just last week, in folk, we had an event called, Friendship Unlimited. On the occasion of Friendship Day. And on that occasion, we had a wonderful theatre play, put up by the folk members. And that play involved, showing the distinction between, material friendship, which is ordinary, and spiritual friendship with Krishna, which is extraordinary. So, we had two parts in the play. The first part, talked about the friendship between, Drona and Drupada. And, we know how Drona and Drupada, promise each other, that we will help. Drupada says that, I will help you when it is needed. But Drona, when he is in need, when he comes, Drupada denies to even agree, that he is my friend. He says, we are not equals, how can we be friends? And he sends him away. And that leads to, lot of many other terrible things happening, which take shape, as the story of Mahabharata proceeds. But then we have, another great friendship, described in the Bhagavatam, the friendship between, Lord Krishna and Sudama. And here also, Sudama happened to be, a poor Brahmana. But when he comes to, Krishna's palace in Dwaraka, and as soon as, Krishna hears the name of Sudama, he runs out of great affection, personally, and he goes and hugs Sudama, in front of everybody, much to the astonishment, of all the residents of Dwaraka. And without asking, Krishna gives unlimited wealth, to Sudama. So we were doing this play, and since I was involved in the play, back in the green room, I was just, before the drama, we were doing final touch up, make up and, you know, costumes of the different roles,

**Key Quote:** "Simply by wearing a five paisa thread, one cannot become a brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker reflects on the ease of creating a 'Brahmana' for a play by simply adding a sacred thread, contrasting it with the true qualifications of a Brahmana and the superficiality prevalent in Kali Yuga.

different characters. So, the first scene was, Drona Drupada, childhood scene. So in few minutes, they were supposed to go, on the stage, small boys, childhood scene. So, I was seeing, something is missing. Something is missing. Okay, we have dressed them very nicely, they are looking like, young, gurukul students, gurukul boys, but something is missing. What is that? Then I thought, oh, the sacred thread is missing. And, since they were small boys, they were only wearing dhoti, and, sacred thread, if it is not there, it will, it will not suit their character, their roles. So immediately, I asked somebody, get a spool of thread, and instantly made three, you know, layers, three layers, and put the sacred thread, on the two children, and send them on the stage. Making a brahmana, is so easy, you see. So, I was just reflecting this, after the drama, so easily, you know, brahmana, thread was not there, immediately, I brought a white thread, and sent them on the stage, with the sacred thread. Is becoming a brahmana, so cheap, in real life? Okay, on the stage, it is understandable, it is a drama, but then, in real life, so I just remember, one of the, purports, that Srila Prabhupada writes, I think in the seventh canto, Bhagavatam, there Prabhupada says, simply by wearing, a five paisa thread, one cannot become, a brahmana. Five paisa thread. In fact, Srimad Bhagavatam, predicts that, in the Kali Yuga, vipratve sutramevahi, somebody will be called, a vipra, a brahmana, merely by showing his, sutra, thread. You see, unfortunate situation. So a brahmana, is not just a person, who is wearing thread, and flaunts it everywhere. See, I have this, I have this thread, so I am a brahmana.

#### Brahmana qualifications, Knowledge of Absolute Truth, ISKCON's mission, Varnashrama, Division of Labor

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Brahma janati, iti brahmana - he must have knowledge about the absolute truth, then he is a brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker defines a Brahmana as one who knows the Absolute Truth, emphasizing that birth alone is insufficient, and highlights ISKCON's mission to create first-class Brahmanas, explaining the Varnashrama system as a division of labor centered on Krishna.

No! What is the qualification, of a brahmana? Who is a brahmana? The Vedic scriptures, tell us. Brahma janati, iti brahmana. Brahma janati, he must have knowledge, about the absolute truth. Then, he is a brahmana. Merely by taking birth, in a particular family, one cannot claim, that he has become, a qualified brahmana. This is a very important thing, that Srila Prabhupada, brought about, many times, when he was, talking about, the importance of, brahmanas. In fact, Srila Prabhupada says, that our movement, the Krishna consciousness movement, the ISKCON society, is meant for creating, first class brahmanas, in the society. It is meant for creating, first class brahmanas. And, what is the meaning of, first class brahmanas? Simply wearing a thread? No, not at all. One must actually be, acquainted with, the knowledge of, the absolute truth. And one must also be, busy in engaging, activities connected with, the absolute truth. Then he is a brahmana. So, brahma janati iti brahmana. So there are various qualifications, of a brahmana, that are listed by Lord Krishna himself, in the Bhagavad Gita. If you study, towards the end of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna is giving, what are the four different, social orders. He had already mentioned that, in the fourth chapter of the Gita. Lord Krishna says, So Lord Krishna says, I have divided, the entire human society, into four divisions. And, what is that four divisions? The brahmanas, the kshatriyas, vaishyas, and the shudras.

#### Varnashrama, Division of Labor, Qualities and Duties, Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras

**Key Quote:** "Intellectual people are Brahmanas, who are supposed to share knowledge to the society."
**Summary:** The speaker elaborates on the four divisions of the Varnashrama system - Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras - explaining their respective qualities and duties as a natural division of labor within society.

Now is this some caste system? That is talked about, in modern terms. No, this is merely, division of labor, in the society. To keep, Krishna in the center, based on one's, qualities, one's, interest of work, one can be whatever he is. But, we keep Krishna in the center, and work. That is called the, Daivi Varanashrama system. Since this system is created by, none other than, the Supreme Lord himself. This is a universal thing. It's not that only in India it exists. It's a universal thing. Srila Prabhupada points out this. When he went to the America, he asked, don't you see in your society, you have intellectual people, you have administrative class of people, you have business class of people, you also have labor class of people. Everywhere you go, four classes of people exist. So this is Varanashrama system. Intellectual people are Brahmanas, who are supposed to, share knowledge to the society. They are like the brain of the body. In the body, they are the brain. Right? Brain is very important, to give us directions. What to do, what not to do. It gives us, directions, well thought decisions. Right? That is Brahmanas. And then, Kshatriyas are those, who are into administration. Who are into, taking care of the, citizens. Protecting them. Kshatrayate iti kshatriya. This is the definition of Kshatriya. One who, protects others from getting hurt. He is called a Kshatriya. Not like modern day, administrative class leaders, who sit in a nice bulletproof, you know, nice room, and they allow the poor soldiers, to go and die on the battlefields. That is not a Kshatriya. Kshatriya must, help others, from getting hurt, by himself exposing, his body. Using weapons. That is Kshatriya. And then, Vaishyas, are the business class of people. Krishi, Vaanijyam, Vaishya Karma Swabhavajam. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita. So, what are the business, what are the, what are the activities, designated for the Vaishyas? Krishi, agriculture. Goraksha, cow protection. Vaanijyam, trade and commerce. These are the things, which are designated as duties, for the Vaishyas. The business class of people. And then, Paricharyatmakam Karyam, Shudra Karma Swabhavajam. So, for the, Shudras, the labor class of people, Paricharyatmakam, serving, service, physical labor, is actually the designated work.

**Key Quote:** "Simple living, and high thinking, should be the philosophy of life."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the qualities of a Brahmana, including truthfulness, simplicity, and sense control, referencing the Sanat Sujata and emphasizing the importance of understanding these qualities in light of ISKCON's mission to create first-class Brahmanas.

So, if everybody is doing their part, in the society, then, there can be peace and tranquility, in the society. No one has to bother, oh now, the enemy king, country is attacking, what to do? You don't have to bother. You go on with your work. There are Kshatriyas, who are well trained and qualified, who will guard the country. Right? So, that is the idea, in the Varanashrama system. So, what are the qualities of a Brahmana? Satyam, first of all. A Brah, to be called as a Brahmana, one must be truthful. Kshatram, Satyam. And then, Arjavam. Arjavam means, simplicity. Simple living, and high thinking, should be, the philosophy of life. Not that we live in high rise buildings, but our thinking is in the Patala. It should not be like that. High thinking should be there. Simple living should be there. So, that is one of the important qualities of a Brahmana. Shamaha, one must be, Shamaha, Damaha. Damaha means, actually, have full control over his senses. One must not let loose his senses and mind. Then he can't be a Brahmana. Right? So, these are all the qualifications. In fact, in a book called, Sanat Sujata, there are 12 qualities of a Brahmana, that are listed. And Prabhupada quotes that. So, what are the qualifications of a real Brahmana? It's very important for us to know. Why it is important for us to know? Because, Prabhupada said, that our organization, our movement, is meant for creating first class Brahmanas. So, therefore, we must know, who is truly, truly, a qualified Brahmana.

#### Prahlada Maharaj, Brahmana qualifications, Activities of a Brahmana, Yajana, Pathana, Dana, Parigraha

**Key Quote:** "Yajana means, worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead and helping others to engage in worshipping the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker introduces Prahlada Maharaj's prayers and discusses the activities of a Brahmana: Yajana (worship), Pathana (study), Dana (giving charity), and Parigraha (accepting charity), emphasizing the importance of helping others in spiritual advancement.

So, this is an interesting verse. We will read, the purport, also, Srimad Bhagavatam, 7th canto, chapter 9, verse number 10. So, Prahalad Maharaj is offering prayers to Lord Narasimha Deva, and he is saying, if a Brahmana, has all 12 of the Brahmanical qualifications, but is, okay, we will come to that later. So, what are the qualifications of a Brahmana? So, Prabhupada says, in the Sanat Sujata, there are qualifications of the Brahmana, explained. The work, the activities of a Brahmana, what are the activities of a Brahmana? First, let us understand that. Then, we will be able to appreciate the qualities corresponding to that. So, Yajana, Yajana, right, Yajana, Yajana, Pathana, Pathana, and Dana, Parigraha. These are the six activities of a Brahmana. Yajana means, worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yajana means, helping others to engage in worshipping the Lord. A Brahmana should not think, I will worship and I will become perfect. No, he must help others, that is part of his duty, assigned service. So, Yajana, Yajana, worship the Lord, and help others to worship the Lord. And then, Pathana, Pathana, I study the Vedic scriptures, and I help others to study the Vedic scriptures, and understanding the real meaning. Pathana means to study, Pathana means to help others to study. So, a Brahmana is supposed to, spread spiritual knowledge in the society, help others to become spiritually advanced. And then, Dana, Parigraha. Dana means to give charity, Parigraha means to accept charity. Brahmana is not simply supposed to accept charity. Whatever charity he gets, from others, he engages it, only as much as it is required, he keeps it with him, and the rest he has to give it back, as charity,

#### Charity, Simplicity, Chanakya Pandit, Shringi's character

**Key Quote:** "Simple living, and high thinking."
**Summary:** The speaker clarifies that a Brahmana's role is not simply to accumulate charity, but to use it for serving the Lord and giving back to society, citing Chanakya Pandit as an example, and contrasts this with the character of Shringi.

for the right cause. It's not that he just collects charity. Many times we keep hearing, Daan Dakshina is a very common word. So, whenever we see in some movies, Brahmanas are generally portrayed, you know, sometimes in a funny way, as a greedy Brahmana. He will always keep asking, Daan Dakshina Dijiye. Right? So, quality of Brahmana, work of Brahmana, is not simply to keep accepting Daan Dakshina. It's not that I'll show my sacred thread, and keep accepting as much as possible. No, that is not the idea. The idea is, one accepts as much as required for him, for his purpose of serving the Lord, and the rest, he actually gives it back to the society. Srila Prabhupada, gives the example of Chanakya Pandit, who was also a qualified Brahmana. And, even though he was playing a very important role, in the kingdom of Chandragupta Maurya, in the Mauryan kingdom, and even though the king offered him, a big palatial building for him to stay, Chanakya denied. He said, I don't want to stay in the palace. So, he preferred to stay in a, humble cottage, outside the palace. But he was, guiding Chandragupta Maurya. He was guiding him on the principles of Vedic understanding. So, a Brahmana, will never actually, a real Brahmana, will never actually, think that I should usurp more and more wealth. No. Arjavam. Arjavam. Simplicity. Simple living, and high thinking. But here you see, but here you see, in this verse we see, this Brahmana boy, what are the different words used by, Srila Prabhupada in the purport, to describe this Brahmana boy, Shringi. Shringi was the son of Shamika Rishi. Perhaps we all know the story, we have been discussing this verse from many weeks.

**Key Quote:** "Even though he was Brahmana, he was instructed in several mantras by his father, so he was very powerful, but since he was inexperienced, he was immature, he did not know what is the right usage of these Brahmanical powers."
**Summary:** The speaker revisits the story of Parikshit Maharaj and Shringi, emphasizing Shringi's inexperience and misuse of Brahmanical powers, leading him to curse a pure devotee.

Parikshit Maharaj, when he was tired, thirsty, hungry, he approaches the, cottage of, Shamika Rishi. Shamika Rishi was in meditation. He did not actually, give a good hospitality. He did not receive the King Parikshit. So Parikshit, jokingly, he took a, dead snake, and, put it around his neck, around the, sages neck, and he went away. So when this was known to Shringi, so what did Shringi, do, is what we are reading these verses. What did he think? So Prabhupada uses specific words, to describe Shringi. First of all he says, inexperienced boy. You know he is an inexperienced boy. Sometimes, when powers are given to us, when we are still inexperienced and immature, more than good, doing good to others, we end up, harming others. That is depicted here in Shringi. Even though he was Brahmana, he was instructed in several mantras by his father. So he was very powerful. He was following all the rules and regulations of a Brahmana. So he had that Brahmanical strength. But, since he was inexperienced, he was immature, he did not know what is the right usage of these Brahmanical powers. Therefore, he dared to curse the pure devotee, King Pariksit.

**Key Quote:** "Smartphone is supposed to make us smart, isn't it? But it is not making us smart, it is actually making us dull, dumb."
**Summary:** The speaker draws a parallel between Shringi's misuse of power and the modern misuse of technology, particularly smartphone addiction, which can lead to dullness and harm.

Now in our situation today, if you see, all of us, we have access to the most advanced technology. Technology is the power today. Like Shringi had some powers back then, now all of us also have technology. The best technology is at the tip of our fingers. Right? We can access any content. We can, we can do anything. We can sit at our place and order food, order groceries, everything is. No doubt it has made our life very very comfortable. But, there are also the other side of this. Lot of people are becoming victims of so much of addiction to internet usage. Right? So there is power, but since we are not qualified to use the power properly, we are not trained, see, we misuse it and bring harm to ourselves. So just like Shringi had powers and he misused it to curse a pure devotee, what we are doing, this power is there, but we are not qualified to use it properly. So, lot of people becoming victims of the smartphone addiction. Smartphone is supposed to make us smart, isn't it? But it is not making us smart, it is actually making us dull, dumb. It's a fact. Of course, it's not that we should not use smartphone. We should use as much as it is required. Regulated usage will give us real benefit. But if we use it more than required, every now and then seeing the smartphone, every now and then want to check what is the notification, every now and then...

#### Chanting, Inattentiveness, Offenses, Smartphone, Immaturity

**Key Quote:** "It is also offensive to be inattentive while chanting."
**Summary:** The speaker discusses the offense of inattentiveness while chanting, using the example of simultaneously chanting and chatting on a smartphone, and connects it back to Shringi's immaturity and offense.

So, in fact, even while chanting, on one hand we have the bead bag, beads. On the other hand, some of the devotees have smartphone. So chanting is going on on one hand, chatting is going on on other hand. Chatting and chanting simultaneously going on. Krishna is confused. Is he talking to me or is he talking to somebody? Chanting means we are talking to Krishna. It is our private time with Krishna, with the holy name. We are supposed to spend quality time with Krishna. But instead of doing that, we are interrupting in between. Every day we chant the ten offences to be avoided against chanting the holy names of the Lord. And the last offence, it is also offensive to be inattentive while chanting. That's an offence. It is listed in the Padma Purana. Ten offences against chanting. So if we want to make quick progress towards the desired goal of chanting, which is to attain pure love for Krishna, we must stay away from these offences. Right? So here also, Shrunge committed a great blunder because of his immaturity. So he was given powers, but he didn't know how to use it. So therefore, he committed an offence.

#### Varnashrama, Personal Prestige, Cooperation, Krishna Prema, False Prestige, Kali Yuga

**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "This mentality has led to degradation of such a wonderful Varnashrama system which exists, which was existing in the Vedic period."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that the Varnashrama system is meant for cooperation, not personal prestige, and that Shringi's mentality reflects the degradation of the system in Kali Yuga, characterized by justifying wrong actions due to false prestige.

Right? So Prabhupada says, this particular thinking of Shrunge, that I am born in Brahmana family and this person Pariksit Maharaj is after all a Kshatriya, who is a Gruhapala, who is a watchdog. Therefore, I can command him. I can curse him. This mentality has led to degradation of such a wonderful Varanashrama system which exists, which was existing in the Vedic period. This is the beginning of downfall of the Vedic culture, Prabhupada says. Right? So these positions, Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, these positions are not meant for taking it as a personal prestige. It's not meant for that. It's meant for cooperation, helping everybody together to achieve the goal of life, which is to attain Krishna Prema, which is to attain devotional service to Krishna. That purpose is forgotten and people think that, oh now I am this Brahmana, now I am this, I am that. Merely going by designations. So that has led to the downfall of, unfortunately, downfall of such a wonderful system created by the Lord Himself. And we can see that, that is very, very rampant in the Kali Yuga. So Prabhupada says in the purport, Shringi, on the contrary, he, he means Shringi, justified the wrong act in a way characteristic of the Brahmanas of Kali Yuga. What is the characteristic feature of the so-called Brahmanas of Kali Yuga? They try to justify anything and everything they do. Because we are qualified, we can do anything. So this is the characteristic feature of Kali Yuga Brahmanas. Right? So that is arising out of false prestige, as Prabhupada says in the purport.

#### False Ego, Puffed Up, Humility, King's Duty

**Key Quote:** "Because I am the king, when I am walking on the street, everybody should fall flat on me, on the ground. Expecting this kind of an honour because of one's position, that is due to false ego."
**Summary:** The speaker defines false prestige and ego, using the analogy of puffed rice, and explains that true leadership is not about demanding honor but about serving others.

Now what is this false prestige? Okay, now for a king to think that I am the king of this kingdom and I have to rule this kingdom, is it wrong? No, the king can think like that. I am the king. There is no problem. But if he thinks, I can do anything and everything just because I am the king, then that is the problem. Because I am the king, when everyone, when I am walking on the street, everybody should fall flat on me, on the ground. Expecting this kind of an honour because of one's position. That is due to false ego. There is a nice word that Prabhupada uses many times, puffed up. You know, if you actually research Prabhupada books and lectures, conversations, you will find this word many times, puffed up. Puffed up, being puffed up of false ego. Prabhupada uses this word. Whenever I hear this word puffed up, I remember puffed rice. So there is flat rice and there is puffed rice. Flat rice or chipped rice, Chidadahi we use for, we offer during Chidadahi Mahotsava, chipped rice. And then there is puffed rice. So what is the difference between the two if you see? Chipped rice, if you soak it in water or if you soak it in mango juice or whatever, it absorbs that essence, mango juice and becomes very tasty. Right? Whereas puffed rice, you just have to open it and keep. It will just fly away because of air. It can't, it does not have sattva. So those who are puffed up, see I am so great. I can do so much. Because of my abilities, I am doing so many things. If somebody is thinking like that, they are like puffed rice. Right? One violent, one wind comes, blows away. They are nowhere to be seen. So this Shringi was puffed up. He was thinking too much about himself. Right? Many times this kind of a mentality

#### Devotee's Pride, Humility, Servant, Prabhupada's Mercy, Dasa

**Key Quote:** "One should always understand that whatever I am practicing, it is due to the causeless mercy of Srila Prabhupada."
**Summary:** The speaker cautions against pride creeping into devotees, emphasizing that all accomplishments are due to Prabhupada's mercy and that the true identity is that of a servant (Dasa) of the Lord.

can creep into the devotees also. Right? What is that? See I am practicing Krishna Chakra, this consciousness. I have practiced the consciousness from so many years. And Prabhupada has said, one who is a devotee, by default, he is a Brahmana. One who is a Vaishnava, by default, he is a Brahmana also, because he is following a Brahminical way of life. So we start thinking, see I am so great. All these Kali Yuga brahmanas, ah they don't know, they don't chant Hare Krishna Mantra. They will be wearing a sacred thread. But I am so great. You know, this kind of a pride leads to fall down. One should never be proud. One should always understand that whatever I am practicing, it is due to the causeless mercy of Srila Prabhupada. One should always pass all respects to Prabhupada. Many times, you know, in the community of devotees, we address each other as Prabhu. Prabhu means master. And if we are not in the right consciousness, we may think, Oh, I am the master. All these people are coming to me and saying, I am master. But within the community of devotees, Prabhupada had made sure that you don't only be addressed as Prabhu, but you should also address others as Prabhu. Not that only I will be called as master. Right? We are Prabhu as long as we are sincerely serving Prabhupada. Without Prabhupada, no Prabhu. Prabhupada means what? He at whose feet all Prabhus sit. All Prabhus have to be situated at the feet of Prabhupada. Then you are Prabhu. As long as you are serving Prabhupada, you are Prabhu. And that too, when somebody addresses you as Prabhu, you know, you should immediately remind yourself, I am Dasa. I am servant of the Lord.

#### Initiation, Spiritual Name, Servant, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Humility

**Key Quote:** "The main part of your initiated name is Dasa. Focus on that. Dasa means your servant of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker shares an anecdote about Prabhupada emphasizing the importance of 'Dasa' (servant) in the initiated name and highlights Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's prayer expressing himself as the servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord.

You know, one occasion, Prabhupada had given initiation. And, you know, in the West, in the US, and the devotees after initiation, they were all very excited about their new names. After initiation, you get new name. Right? They were all excited. They were discussing about their names with each other. And some of them were saying, See, my name is very ordinary. Some Paramatma Das. Not so. But your name, Radha Madhav Das. You know, your name is directly connected with Radhakrishna. Your name is so special, very intimate to the Lord. My name is Paramatma Das. You know. So, like, I don't know. People think, there are gradations in names also. But, Prabhupada heard, overheard this. Devotees thinking like this. Oh, my name is Paramatma Das. My name is so special. Your name is... Prabhupada immediately came and said, The main part of your initiated name is Dasa. Focus on that. Dasa means your servant of the Lord. That is the main part of your name, spiritual name. Focus on that. Right? So, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was offering prayers to Lord Jagannath, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu prayed very nicely. What did he pray? He said, My dear Lord, I am neither a Brahmana, nor a sanyasi, nor a very learned person. I am none of these things. He said, Gopi Bhartu Pada Kamalayor Dasa Dasa Anudasa I am servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of your Lord. I am the servant of your Lordship, the maintainer of the Gopis. Right?

#### Material vs. Spiritual, Lording Over, Humility, Dasa Dasa Anudasa, False Prestige, Holier Than Thou

**Content Type:** philosophy
**Audience:** Full-time devotees, Congregation / volunteers
**Key Quote:** "Actual spiritual humility is, I am Dasa Dasa Anudasa. I am servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord."
**Summary:** The speaker contrasts the material mentality of lording over others with the spiritual humility of being a servant of the servant, and warns against the 'holier than thou' attitude.

That is the mood Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is trying to teach us. On the contrary, material thinking is what? I want to lord over everything. I want to become boss, bossaadi boss. Right? I want to become boss of the boss. Right? One person to lord over is not enough. I want a big group of people. I want to create more followers. I want to become their boss and rule them. That is the material mentality. But actual spiritual humility is, I am Dasa Dasa Anudasa. I am servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did not say, I am servant of Krishna. He can say at least, right? Krishna himself who came to teach us by his own example, how to be a servant. He could have said, I am servant of Radha Krishna. He didn't say that. He said, I am servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord. You see, that is the mood which is very very important that all devotees should maintain. So, this false prestige is also called holier than thou attitude. Holier than thou. It's an expression in English. Holier than thou means, I am great than you. Why? Because every day, I am chanting Hare Krishna Mantra 16 rounds. These Karmis, you know, they are useless people. I am great. You know, this kind. So, it may appear that, I am a devotee. What is wrong in saying like this? No. But the underlying principle is what? To show that others are inferior to me. I am great. See, it is because of this mentality that the Varanashrama system degraded in Kali Yuga. Instead of having a cooperative mentality among the four orders of life, when each person tried to exert his influence and assert his position superior to others, then it started degrading.

#### False Prestige, Daksha Prajapati, Actions vs. Positions, Competition

**Key Quote:** "Our actions are more important, not our positions."
**Summary:** The speaker uses the example of Daksha Prajapati to illustrate how false prestige can lead to a loss of discrimination and a focus on competition rather than genuine spiritual progress.

So, among the devotees, we should not have this kind of a thinking. Right? So, there are various examples of how false prestige can actually bring us down. Daksha, Daksha Prajapati, perhaps we know about Daksha Prajapati. About him, it is described in the fourth cant of Srimad Bhagavatam. And Daksha Prajapati, he was Prajapati, means he was appointed by Lord Brahma as the progenitor of creatures in this world. So, he was having a very big position. But, in an assembly, he was too much disturbed when all, everybody rose up as he entered and Lord Shiva did not rise from his position. Right? He was puffed up. Right? Puffed up. Everybody should respect me. Why? Because I am Prajapati. Right? So, one, we should understand our actions are more important, not our positions. In the material world, more importance is given to positions, power. After getting all that position, name, fame, what are you actually doing in your daily life? That is more important. Isn't it? See, Daksha Prajapati was, definitely had a big position. But, look at his mentality. Lord Shiva, who is worshipable to all the Devatas, just because he is his son-in-law, he is expecting Lord Shiva should also rise. So, when we are too much conscious about my position, how others will perceive me, you know, we lose the basic discrimination. We lose the spiritual knowledge and everything appears to be, you know, competition. Who is great here? Right?

**Key Quote:** "First, let me use my might. Might is right. That is demon's thinking."
**Summary:** The speaker recounts the story of Ravana attempting to lift Mount Kailasa, highlighting his demonic mentality of relying on might rather than devotion.

Another example, with same Lord Shiva, another demoniac personality, Ravana. Ravana had ten arms. Right? Or ten heads? I was just testing, if you are listening carefully. Yeah. Ravana had ten heads. So, he was a heavy head person. Right? So, once he went to Kailasa, and he said, who is this Lord Shiva? Let us see. Many people say that Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. But, let us examine this situation. After that, your perspective about Ravana will change. So, Ravana said, who is this Shiva? Let us see. And, I will show my might to Shiva. So, what did he do? He wanted to lift Lord Shiva along with his Kailasa. Not as a Vahana Seva. He did not want to do Vahana Seva, Brahmotsava Seva for Lord Shiva. That was not the idea. He wanted to show his might. So, he was lifting, trying to lift. So, then what happened? Lord Shiva said, some fellow has come. He is thinking, he is too much about himself. Let me teach a lesson. So, he just pressed with his thumb, he just pressed the Kailasa. And, it fell down. The Kailasa and his hand got stuck there. He is trying his best to remove the hand. He is not able to do that. Right? And then, he thought, now my might is not helping me. See, this is the thinking of demons. First, let me use my might. Might is right. That is demon's thinking. And, when might doesn't work, okay, I will fall at your feet. But, that is not with true devotion.

**Key Quote:** "Pride goes before a fall."
**Summary:** The speaker continues the story of Ravana, emphasizing his pride and ultimate downfall at the hands of Lord Ramachandra, who appeared in human form.

So, there also, Ravana wanted to exhibit his Sanskrit scholarly ability. So, he composed one song to glorify Lord Shiva. There also, it was not out of devotion. If you read the song, you know, it is too much of showing his hold on Sanskrit language, Sanskrit poetry and grammar. And then, Lord Shiva said, okay, this fellow, at least he came to his senses. And, he forgave him. He forgave Ravana. See how, Ravana's prestige, you know, there is a prestige cooker. So, prestige is like too much thinking about yourself. You know, bhavlena, they say, right? Too much, I am thinking about myself. So, Ravana was like that. He was, he was, finally by his faults, he didn't learn a lesson even after that. He didn't know that, okay, Lord Shiva, out of his mercy, he has forgiven me. But, later on, he went on to challenge the supreme personality of Godhead, Ramachandra himself. He was thinking too much about himself. And finally, you know, Lord Ramachandra taught him a very big lesson, which he can never forget. And, no one should forget also. Right? So, that's why there is a saying, pride goes before a fall. Pride goes before a fall. So, now human beings are also doing the same thing today in Kali Yuga. Prabhupada points out this. Humans think that we are the superior species. All other species, you know, they are all useless people. Like Ravana, we are also thinking. Ravana, when he did tapasya to Lord Brahma, he gave a list of all kinds of personalities who should not kill him. Yakshas, Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Devatas, Danavas. He gave a big list. But he didn't add humans into that list. Because he was saying, humans are like mosquitoes. How can I even think that somebody will, human being will come and challenge me? That was his thinking, you know. That's why the Lord appeared as a human being, Lord Ramachandra. And then he taught a big lesson to Ravana. Isn't it?

**Key Quote:** "As long as there are slaughterhouses, there will be battlefields."
**Summary:** The speaker criticizes the human belief in superiority over other species, leading to violence and slaughterhouses, and argues that this violence prevents peace and happiness.

So, human beings today are thinking like that about other species of life. By opening slaughterhouses. In fact, some people who are so called religious also think that all animals are meant for my satisfaction of my tongue and my belly. So they have big big slaughterhouses, mechanized slaughterhouses. Per hour, they kill lakhs and lakhs of innocent animals. And they think, yes, because I am the most advanced species, I have control over all. I am so great. But Mother Nature boomerangs. Mother Nature gives it back. How? As long as there are slaughterhouses, there will be battlefields. Every now and then we have battles, wars. Isn't it? So many innocent people are dying in the wars. Why? Because we are killing innocent animals. As long as we don't stop violence against animals, it is not possible that we live a peaceful, happy life. So Prabhupada would always say this. So therefore, we should never think that, you know, we are so great, we are so advanced. No, that is not the thinking. Right?

#### Vedic Culture, Atithi Devo Bhava, Hospitality, Parikshit Maharaj, Shami Karushi, Shringi

**Key Quote:** "Atithi Devo Bhava, a guest, when he comes to your house, you are supposed to give him treatment as good as God."
**Summary:** The speaker explains the Vedic principle of 'Atithi Devo Bhava' (treating guests as God) and argues that Shami Karushi and Shringi failed to provide proper hospitality to Parikshit Maharaj.

So, in the Vedic culture, Atithi Devo Bhava, a guest, when he comes to your house, you are supposed to give him treatment as good as God. Atithi means one who comes without Tithi. One who comes without prior notice. Not that you send a WhatsApp message and say, I am going to come to your house. Then, actually speaking, it is not Atithi. In the strict usage of the term, Atithi. So Parikshit Maharaj was an Atithi. At the house of Shami Karushi. So even according to moral Vedic standards, it was the duty of Shami Karushi to give a good hospitality to Parikshit Maharaj. See, from various angles you can see. From moral standards also it was important for Shami Karushi to give a good hospitality. Good hospitality doesn't mean you have to give chappan bhog. You can just speak a few good words. Offer a sitting place. Offer a glass of water. That's all. That is a minimum reception that any person deserves. One who comes to your place. Shami Karushi did not do that. From spiritual point of view, Parikshit Maharaj was Vishnuratha. Right? He was personally protected by the Lord himself when he was in the womb of his mother. He was a sent person. Pure devotee. And he definitely deserves all respect and honour. Which, Shami Karushi did not offer. And then, as a citizen, King is supposed to be the representative of the Lord. Naradeva. The King is described as Naradeva. The representative of the Lord. From that angle also, Parikshit Maharaj should have been respected by Shami Karushi. See, there is so much lapse on the side of Shami Karushi and Shringi. But still Shringi is justifying the acts of his father. This is wrong. This is wrong.

**Summary:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of giving respect to others without expecting it in return and introduces an anecdote about Western devotees in Vrindavan.

So, we must have the understanding. I will just take 5 more minutes. So, We must have the understanding. We must be ready to give respect. This is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said. Amanina Manadena. You don't expect respect from anybody. But be ready to offer all respects to others. This is very very important. So, Just to sum up, You know the essence of this verse. How Prabhupada wanted us to be real Brahmanas, not just namesake Brahmanas. There is one interesting anecdote from Shila Prabhupada's pastimes. Once, Prabhupada along with his devotees, western devotees, they had come to Vrindavan. And few devotees, they were sanyasis, American sanyasis, American devotees. So, They had gone to one of the local temples in Vrindavan to have darshan of the Lord. So, when they were having darshan of the Lord, the priest of that temple was quite appreciative. Oh, white skin people with saffron dress, sanyasis, wearing Tilak, chanting Hare Krishna Mantra. He was very appreciative. So, he came and spoke to them. And he said, You are so good. Oh, westerners, you are so good. Very nice.

**Key Quote:** "A Vaishnava who is cent percent devoted to the Lord, following the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master, is actually more than a Brahmana."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes with an anecdote about an old lady blessing a magistrate, illustrating that a Vaishnava is more advanced than a Brahmana, and encourages listeners to commit to Prabhupada's instructions for spiritual progress.

And then, he said, the priest said, Very nicely you are doing bhakti. I bless you that in the next life, you will take birth in a Brahmana family and you will make advancement. This is what the priest said. So, these devotees, they heard this and they came back to Prabhupada and narrated the whole thing. And when Prabhupada heard this, Prabhupada smiled. And Prabhupada narrated another story. So, Prabhupada said, once there was an old lady, this is in the British India, in some remote village she was living. And she had some quarrel with respect to property issue with her relatives. So, to that village, once magistrate visited that village. So, that lady, that old woman was very happy. So, magistrate will come and help me to sort out this quarrel with my family members and I will get my due share of my property. She was thinking. And she approached the magistrate. And the magistrate helped her also, made sure that whatever is her due share of the property, she got it. And she was so happy, since she was an old woman, she wanted to offer some blessings. To this magistrate. So, she said, she was thinking, you know, being a, you know, magistrate is not a very big thing. Right? Being a police constable is a very big thing. You have lot of power and you can do this danda, you can have, you know. So, he said, she blessed, I bless you that in the next life you will become a police constable. Poor lady, she didn't know that he is already magistrate. But, you know, police constable, she is blessing. So, Prabhupada narrated this story and said, it is something like that. What has happened to you in the temple in Vrindavan is something like that. So, actually, a Vaishnava who is cent percent devoted to the Lord, following the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master, is actually more than a Brahmana. Actually, that is the conclusion. So, if we follow the instructions given by Srila Prabhupada nicely, chanting minimum 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra attentively and following strictly the four regulative principles, then, by the mercy of Prabhupada, we can acquire all the Brahmanical qualifications and we can make progress more than that. Prabhupada said, a Vaishnava is an advanced Brahmana. More than that, we are not supposed to stay in the Brahma Jnana level, Brahmana level. We are supposed to become a devotee, lover of Krishna. That is Vaishnava. So, let us all pray to Srila Prabhupada that let us all commit to Prabhupada, rather, we should commit to Prabhupada that I will strictly adhere to the instructions given by your divine grace and help me become truly qualified, not just for namesake. Let me become truly qualified and let me serve your glorious mission and make my life successful. So, we will stop here. Granth Raj Srimad Bhagavatam Ki Jai

**Key Quote:** "Ramayana teaches us mere education is not enough we have to make people wise and they become wise when they develop character like lord shri ram not like ravan."
**Summary:** The lecture contrasts the educated but unwise Ravana with the educated and wise Lord Rama, highlighting the importance of character and self-control over mere education, using examples from the Ramayana to illustrate the difference.

How to educate people, how to earn property in the rightful manner. Ravan was also called brahmin, he was educated. What did he do when he heard about the beauty of mother Sita? He became lusty. Difference between being educated, being wise. Ramayan teaches an important lesson for all of us, especially in the modern day, the difference between being educated, being wise. We find the example of Ravan, who was highly educated, who was called Pandit Ravan. Ravan was called Pandit. He is a son of a great sage called Vishravas, a brahmana sage Vishravas, and Ravan was also called brahmin, right? People say that he is brahmin. The brahmin is the one who knows the Vedas, who has got a lot of knowledge, but unfortunately, even though he was a Pandit, he was son of a brahmana sage Vishravas, he was not a wise person. He had so much of arrogance, he was lusty, he was greedy, he was arrogant. When he heard about the beauty of mother Sita, he became lusty and he went to kidnap mother Sita, who was married, was happily living with her husband Shri Ram, but he went and kidnapped her. His education didn't help him. And he was educated, what did he do? He went and snatched Lanka from his half brother Kubera. So he was power hungry, he wanted property of Lanka and he was hungry, so he was not satisfied. His education didn't teach him how to be satisfied. His education didn't teach him how to earn property in the rightful manner. In a wrong way, he snatched property from his own brother Kubera. He went and kidnapped a married woman because he was lusty. So but he was highly educated. On the other hand, we see the great personality Lord Shri Ram, who was also educated, but more than educated, he was a wise person. The moment he was asked to choose between Ayodhya and going to forest, he happily chose to go to forest and gave up Ayodhya to his own brother Bharat. In fact, in Ramayana we see when Bharat was ready to offer Ayodhya back to Ram, Ram was very happy being in the forest. He wanted Bharat to continue to be the king and take care of Ayodhya till he returns. So Ram was very satisfied with what was there in his life. He was not an ambitious, over ambitious person like Ravan, who was ready to snatch property from his own brother. Here Ram is happily handing over Ayodhya to his own brother Bharat. And Ram, even though Shurpanaka came and offered herself, Ram did not become lusty. He had control over himself. He used his wisdom, he used his power, his knowledge to have control over himself, to follow the promise given to his own wife that ekapatni vratasta. When a woman, a beautiful woman coming and offering herself with her own consent, let's have fun, Ram said no, I cannot, I would like to follow my promise and I'm not interested in this. But Ravan became lusty. Ram exhibited self-control. So we need wise people, not just knowledge of the world, but knowledge of the world and knowledge of the people, not educated people. In today's society, we are all talking about how to educate people, but Ramayana teaches us mere education is not enough. We have to make people wise and they become wise when they develop character like Lord Shri Ram, not like Ravan. If you are only concerned about education, not character building, then we will have a lot of educated characterless people like Ravan. Like we hear many times when the police arrest some of the terrorists, some of the terrorists happen to be highly educated, like double degree, like medical, they have done their MBBS, they have done their masters in some engineering field and they have become terrorists. So we need people like Lord Shri Ram and Shri Ram teaches us the importance of wisdom, importance of knowledge.

This is the quality of those who are powerful. A power is always used in the service of the weak people. In that way, Hanuman was in the side of Sugriv. When Hanuman came to know about Lord Shriram, whose wife was kidnapped, that means there was injustice done to Lord Shriram by Ravana. Immediately Hanuman came to do saviour. To deliver justice to Shriram, Hanuman also worked very hard to bring justice to distressed women like Mother Sita. Sita was put into a very, very distressful condition by Ravana and Hanuman fought with great valour to give justice to Mother Sita. So Hanuman is popular and worshipped because throughout his life, he used his power, his intelligence, his courage in the service of Dharma, in the service of Nyaya,

He became the servant of a glorious leader like Shriram. In Ramayana, we also see Ravana, who is also powerful. Ravan also had many powerful, intelligent servants but nobody is remembered today. They all gave up their lives serving Ravan but nobody is worshipped and nobody, we don't even know their names because they were all on the side of adharma and the side of anyai. Anybody who takes the side of adharma and anyai, they will be dead and they will be forgotten. Even in the modern history, there are many so-called powerful people like Napoleon, like Hitler. Do we even remember them or their followers? No, we don't even know who are their followers. But Hanuman, from thousands of years, people remember, glorify, worship him

**Key Quote:** "Hanuman received nothing in return. He received the love of Shri Ram."
**Summary:** This segment emphasizes Hanuman's selfless service and the love he received from Lord Shriram as his reward, highlighting his example as a servant leader who inspires others to follow dharma and nyaya without expecting personal gain.

because he stood for nyaya and dharma and that is why he has become an inspiration for everyone to follow. Even though Hanuman did so much service to Lord Shri Ram, did he ever ask anything in return? When I become servant of somebody, I am always thinking what is the profit of doing so much of service? What did I get in return? What is the reward that Hanuman received? Hanuman received nothing in return. He received the love of Shri Ram. So here is a selfless person. For whom, the service to dharma, service to nyaya itself is a reward. So I think we all have an inherent attraction to such people who stand up for dharma, who stand up for nyaya selflessly, not for any reward. So Hanuman is that example who selflessly fought for nyaya and dharma for Shri Ram and he remained very happy and satisfied, servant of Shri Ram. So he teaches an example how to become a servant leader. He is a good servant of Shri Ram and he is a good leader for all of us to follow.

**Summary:** The speaker introduces the question of why Lord Ram banished Sita, emphasizing the importance of a leader's spotless character and public perception.

Did Lord Shri Ram doubt his beloved wife, Mother Sita, especially after she gave Agni Pariksha? Today, we all demand that our leaders should be corruption free.

**Summary:** The speaker explains that Lord Ram and Sita, as king and queen, needed to maintain a spotless character to inspire citizens to follow dharma, drawing a parallel to modern expectations of corruption-free leaders.

to be king and queen. Did Lord Shri Ram doubt his beloved wife, Mother Sita, especially after she gave Agni Pariksha? Just because an ordinary citizen passed in your comments on Sita's character? No, never. Lord Shri Ram never doubted his wife, Sita. Then how do we understand? Then why did he send Mother Sita to forest just because of somebody doubting the character of Sita? It is because we need to understand Lord Shri Ram and Sita, they are not just husband and wife. They are also the king and queen of Ayodhya. As a king and queen of Ayodhya, it is very important to have spotless character to continue to be king and queen. So when the citizens had this doubt that their queen was with some other man for one year, they had this doubt that whether she is fit to continue to be queen of Ayodhya. Like today, we all demand that our leaders should be corruption free. If we come to know or if we get a doubt that this leader is involved in some gotala, there is some corruption charges, we many times we see people asking them to step down. We ask them resign from your post because you know you have to prove that you are corruption free. If there are any allegations of corruption, you cannot continue to occupy the post of a minister. Similarly, in those days, it is not just corruption, it was also character which was more important, right. So it was very important for king and queen to have spotless character and that inspires the citizen also to follow the dharma marga, the righteous path. If the king and queen themselves have a dubious character, compromised character, immoral, unethical, that will encourage the citizens also to follow

In their life, so it is not just enough for the king and queen to do economic development and give all the facilities in the citizen, there also should be inspiring figures to follow dharma, to follow morality, to follow ethical good behavior, conduct. So Lord Ram and Mother Sita were teaching that to their citizens by themselves having spotless character. So Mother Sita, as a queen, her character was doubted. That is why Lord Sri Ram, till her character was proven again, asked Mother Sita to be away from the politics of Ayodhya or away from the palace, away from the king's life. As a king, he distanced himself from the queen. As husband, he always

maintained his highest relationship with Mother Sita. He never doubted Mother Sita's character. When Ram did Rajasuya Yagna, Rajasuya Yagna or any Yagna can always be done by a married person with his wife, because wife has equal rights to participate in Yagna. At that time, Sita was at the forest. As a ideal king, Lord Sri Ram, distanced himself from Queen Sita, whose character was under question. But, as a loving husband he never doubted his beloved wife Sita. Rajasuya is an example for this. Rajasuya Yajna was done by kings and when Lord Shri Ram was about to do Rajasuya Yajna, the priest in Ayodhya questioned Lord Shri Ram, where is the wife? Because without wife, you cannot perform Rajasuya Yajna alone. At that time, Lord Shri Ram as loving husband got golden statue of Sita, his beloved wife and along with that golden statue Sita, he completed Rajasuya Yajna. If Lord Ram had any doubt about Sita's character, why would he do golden statue of his wife Sita? He gave that glorious position of his wife. In the Rajasuya Yajna, he said that only Sita is eligible to be part of Rajasuya Yajna as my wife. He never rejected Sita as his beloved wife. Yes, queen whose character was under doubt, the public had the doubt, not the king Ram, husband Ram especially. So Rajasuya Yajna episode tells us Rama gave the glorious position of wife to mother Sita only,

not to Sita. Not to anyone else, not that he rejected Sita. And another very important lesson that many people miss out is the topic of Parivarvaat, today we hear. Today we hear how leaders, powerful people and those occupy the leadership and powerful position in our country do everything for their own family, for their family members, right? At the cost of their own family members, they do everything for their own family members. At the cost of citizens at the cost of the growth of the country. They're very happy to see their family growing, the family property growing, and being with family, being together family, they say, no, no, no, I can't be in the jail. I want to be with my wife. I want to be with my children. But what about country's growth? Nobody cares. But Lord Sri Ram is very different leader. He chose nation. He chose the growth of the country first. He chose the citizens' comfort first, not his personal life. He kept his personal life away from the country. Where do we find such great leaders today? Ram is an inspiration for all the leaders.

**Key Quote:** "He said in his kingdom, citizens can without any fear even question the credibility of the king and queen."
**Summary:** The speaker highlights Lord Ram's tolerance of criticism, contrasting it with authoritarian regimes, and explains that Ram distanced himself from Sita as queen to allow an impartial judgment of her character.

Today, it is very hard to find people who keep their family away and country first. Today, sometimes we hear like in the example of Bangkok in Thailand, there is a monarch dynasty. If you pass any comments, negative comments on the king or that dynasty, you will be jailed. You will be sent to jail. In fact, you may be sentenced. The life sentence be given for those who talk against the royal family. Lord Ram was a monarch. He had all the power in his hand. He could have immediately won. He could have immediately executed those who commented on mother Sita. But he didn't punish those who passed comments on the Sita. He said in his kingdom, citizens can without any fear even question the credibility of the king and queen. He did not threaten the citizen. He did not scare the citizen. I am the powerful person. How dare you talk on my family members? He was okay to be questioned. A king also can be questioned, he said. For that, he could have easily taken the side of Sita. And he said, no, I know the character of my wife Sita. He did not appear to be Parivarwadi. He said, let other authorities justify the Sita's character. Like today, we go to Supreme Court. If there is any corruption charge, the government themselves cannot say we are clean. We are clean. If there is any allegation. A third party like Supreme Court should hear and give verdict. And once the Supreme Court gives verdict, everybody will accept it. If Ram himself speaks in favour of Sita, then people will say, Oh, look how Ram has become so blindly attached to his wife. He obviously speaks in favour of his wife. He is so lusty. He is attached to his wife. So Ram did not take the side of mother Sita. So he distanced himself from the queen.

**Key Quote:** "Valmiki gave his verdict that Sita is, she has spotless character."
**Summary:** The speaker explains that Valmiki, a respected sage, vouched for Sita's character, similar to a Supreme Court verdict, leading to her reacceptance as queen.

But as husband, he always gave the position of a great wife to mother Sita. Later, in another authority in the society, in Treta Yuga, the great sages were given the great authority. Like the kings, they were also authorities. When Valmiki comes and he says with his tapas shakti of 60,000 years of tapasya, he says, I vouch for the character of Sita. And everybody now accepts. He accepts the statement of Valmiki because Valmiki does not have any favouritism, right? Because Sita is no way connected to Valmiki. And Valmiki, who was so pure with his tapas shakti, who has that faith and trust in the public, the public was ready to accept the statement of Valmiki. And when he said that Sita is clean, Sita's character is pure, then Ram said she can come back as the queen of Ayodhya. So, like Supreme Court gave verdict, Valmiki gave his verdict that Sita is, she has spotless character.

#### Sita's Acceptance, Dharma Sankat, Dual Roles, Sacrifice, Nationalism

**Key Quote:** "Ram has dual roles to play. He has a role of a king, role of a husband."
**Summary:** The speaker concludes by emphasizing Sita's acceptance of Ram's actions, understanding his dual roles as king and husband, and highlighting Ram's sacrifice and nationalistic leadership.

At that time, Ram was ready to welcome mother Sita. If at all Ram mistreated his wife Sita, he doubted the character of Sita, he has hurt the feelings and emotions of Sita, then what was Sita's response to this? The Sita's response itself will tell us, that how she was happy with Sri Ram's action of sending her to forest. At the end, mother Sita asked that life after life, I want Sri Ram as my husband. If Sri Ram mistreated her, why she wants Sri Ram again as her husband? That itself will tell us, clarify all the doubts, as a responsible, mature queen, Sita understood the Dharma Sankat of Ram. Ram has dual roles to play. He has a role of a king, role of a husband. So, the family of Lord Sri Ram always stood by country, stood by the welfare of the citizen, not the personal happiness, personal benefit. When it was about to do Pattabhisheka, become king, at that time also Ram chose Ayodhya first, his personal happiness later. He went to forest in order to demonstrate the entire citizen, here is a government that always keeps up the promise. It never goes away from the words, the promises that we have made, Raghukula Reethi Sada Chaliyai. Even at the cost of being in the forest and going through so much tribulation, even at this case, Lord Sri Ram is being away from such loving wife, just to show to the people, the whole world that how a leader always chooses his duty first, country first, welfare of the citizen first, and family is last. He is never a Parivarwadi, in fact he is a Rashtravadi. He is a great, true, inspiring, nationalistic leader
