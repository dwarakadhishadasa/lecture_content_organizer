      "transcript": "Now this is the section where Narad Muni describes his previous life to Vyasa Deva. In the previous session we have seen how Narad Muni begins the description by telling about his previous birth, that he was born as a son of a maidservant, but then he happened to get the association of pure devotees and in their association he engaged in their service and a big transformation took place that is being described. So this 24th verse is Temai Apeta Akhila Chaapale Arbake Dante Adratha Kriyada. The meaning of this verse is, although they were impartial by nature, those followers of the Vedanta blessed me with their causeless mercy. As far as I was concerned, I was self-controlled and had no attachment for sports, even though I was a boy. In addition, I was not naughty and I did not speak more than required."

      "transcript": "So, Narada Muni is describing, he was a small boy. He was not very old, when the sages were camping due to Chaturmasya in the place where Narada Muni's mother was engaged in such menial service. Their nature is they are impartial. They are impartial by nature. They have no special liking for somebody or hatred towards anybody else. No. They are completely impartial. But still, when they see somebody is inclined to actually take up devotional service, then they immediately, out of their causeless mercy, they actually bless such a soul with transcendental enlightenment. So, Narada Muni says, those sages, they blessed him, with their causeless mercy. Now, what was this boy's behavior? He was self-controlled and he had no attachment for sports, even though he was a boy. Normally, boys will always be playing, young boys, small boys. Till they come of certain maturity, they generally be engaged in playing, playing, playing. But, Narada Muni, this boy was an unusual boy. He was not interested in sports, childish sports. And, he was controlled, self-controlled. He was not naughty and he did not speak more than required."

Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu describes that in the Vedas, there are three subjects. What are the three subjects? To establish the relation of the living entities with the personality of Godhead, to perform the relative duties in devotional service, and thus achieve the ultimate goal of going back home, back to Godhead. It's called Sambandha Abhideya Prayojana. Sambandha is, each one of us have got a relationship with the Supreme Lord. Every living being, without exception, because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Mamey Vamsho Jeeva Loke Jeeva Bhuta Sanatana. And, in that relationship, there are certain activities. Relationship means activities. So, such activities performed in the relationship with the Supreme Lord are called Abhideya. And, the result is Prayojana. It results in developing our love for the Supreme Lord, or going back home, back to Godhead, where we belong."

      "transcript": "The Vedantavadis, or the followers of Vedanta, as described in this verse by Narad Muni, indicates pure devotees of the Supreme Lord, because sometimes Vedantavadis are mistaken to be those who are impersonalists. Impersonalists actually have no proper understanding of Vedanta philosophy, because they start with an assumption, even though unjustified, that ultimately, the Absolute Truth is impersonal. But, actually, the Absolute Truth has got three features. Impersonal feature is just one of the preliminary understanding of the Absolute Truth. There are two other features, the Paramatma feature and the Bhagavan feature. So, this Paramatma feature and the Bhagavan feature are completely mis-doubted by the impersonalists. Therefore, their understanding of Vedanta, is not complete. It is imperfect. It is incomplete, and it is misleading also, that ultimately, the Absolute Truth is impersonal. No. The Absolute Truth is the personality of Godhead. Therefore, Vedantavadis, refers to the pure devotees of the Supreme Lord, who have full understanding of all the three features of the Absolute Truth. Such Vedantavadis are also called as Bhaktivedantas. They are impartial in distributing the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. To them, nobody is enemy, nobody is friend. Nobody is educated, nobody is uneducated. They don't make distinctions based on all these type of characteristics. Nobody is favorable, nobody is unfavorable."

By birth, it is described, every conditioned soul is born into ignorance. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains this. Everyone is born into ignorance. So, they have to be awakened by such Bhaktivedantas. So, such Bhaktivedantas, they want to get this ignorant mass of people to get out of ignorance, to re-establish their lost relationship with the Supreme Personality of God, Krishna. Now, by the endeavor of such Bhaktivedantas, even the most forgetful souls, most ignorant person, is awakened to a sense of spiritual life. And, the people, in general,"

Now, this boy, Narada in his previous life, when he was the son of a maid servant, this boy, actually, before being initiated even, he was very self-controlled. He was detached from childish sporting, and he was more or less very disciplined. But, the Vedantavadis, the Bhaktivedantas, they were compassionate upon the boy and they did not consider this boy is too small or he is still of an age where he is meant to engage in childish sports. They did not consider that. In spite of his being a small boy, they did initiate him and they blessed him to actually begin to render devotional service. So, this is their causeless mercy upon this boy. But, this boy also happened to be a disciplined, self-controlled boy who is not naughty, who would not speak more than required like that. So, in his case, we can understand his advancement was very, very fast. But, we should always remember the effect of the blessing of such Vedantavadis is very, very powerful. Even if somebody is not so self-controlled, still, they can become very quickly purified"

      "transcript": "by such powerful association. So, therefore, Srila Prabhupada says in the Vedic system, small boys who are about five years of age, between five and eight years, they are sent to the Gurukul or the Guru's ashram and they are systematically trained in Brahmacharya, celibacy, because then their mind can be focused on learning the essential knowledge that is required for self-realization. This training is also compulsory to create good citizens of the state. Without such basic training at an early age, it is difficult to prepare somebody for a good future life as a responsible citizen of the society. Now, the present day situation is such that people have become irresponsible. They are simply engaged in sense enjoyment. Neither they have such Brahmacharya training nor are they serious about the real goal of self-realization. But, the Vedic system is the spiritual acumen is injected into the child even before the birth of the child by what is called as Garbhadana Samskar. The parents actually conceive a child with spiritual consciousness. So, the child is injected with the spiritual acumen at the time of conceiving the child in the mother's womb. So, this is extraordinary chance given to a soul who is taking birth as a human being to prepare for self-realization even before the birth itself. So, this is the way to beget children in complete perfection. So, Srila Prabhupada says without being self-controlled, nobody can make proper progress in self-realization. That's impossible. It's not merely a matter of reading some books or hearing some discourses or studying some literature. No. It is much more than that. It is the systematic training specially in self-control by Brahmacharya. I'll stop here. Thank you very much."
