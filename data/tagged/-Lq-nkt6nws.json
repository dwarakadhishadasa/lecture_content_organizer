      "transcript": "Nadia district, where Navadvip is located, was under the jurisdiction of Chand Kazi, who worked under Nawab Hussain Shah. Under the Kazi's order, his soldiers disrupted Sankirtana, congregational chanting of the Lord's holy names, on the streets of Navadvip. Interestingly, Lord Chaitanya then conducted the very first civil disobedience movement, attended by thousands of devotees, to protest the order of the Kazi and the actions of his soldiers. By seeing that big gathering, Chand Kazi got scared and he hid in the home. Somehow, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu convinced Chand Kazi to come out and had a debate with him and transformed his heart. In this way, Chand Kazi became a great Vaishnava. It is because it is a result of hearing from Lord Chaitanya. Shravanam, the process of Shravanam, is so powerful. Krishna Raj Kaviraj Goswami says this Shravanam process can immediately awaken Krishna Prema."
