      "transcript": "We have been hearing from the supporters of the unauthorized self-appointed Guru system in ISKCON that the Rithvik system was temporary and they also say that Srila Prabhupada said, disciple of my disciple, grand disciple, he becomes regular Guru. These kind of words are loosely bandied about. So, they quote these. Words like disciple of my disciple, grand disciple and these kind of things. And say that because of these words from Srila Prabhupada, Rithvik system is not bona fide. That Prabhupada's disciples are authorized to be Gurus by Prabhupada. So, in this video, let us get to the bottom of this. The most crucial pieces of information. The most crucial pieces of evidence for the Rithvik system of initiations in ISKCON are two in number. Number one, the May 28th, 1977 GBC meeting with Srila Prabhupada. And number two, the July 9th, 1977 directive. So, these words, disciple of my disciple, grand disciple, he becomes regular Guru. These are all taken out of the. May 28th meeting. So, out of these two important pieces of evidence, the May 28th conversation and the July 9th directive. Let us first take up the May 28 GBC meeting."

      "transcript": "So, before we dive into that meeting, let us first understand why this meeting assumes importance and what relevance it has today. When Srila Prabhupada is not physically with us anymore. Because Prabhupada, there are many, many recordings of Prabhupada's conversations. So, what is special about this conversation? To understand this, we have to go back in history to the year 1977. Now, first, let us hear one revealing conversation between Tamal Krishna Goswami and Srila Prabhupada. This conversation took place on 22nd. 22nd. 22nd of April, 1977. People complained again also. Did you know that? I am not sure of the particular incidences, but I have heard generally. In Germany. In Germany. The devotees there. I am coming. That is where we met. The devotees offered me their condolences. Why is 지는 Goodbye. Get well. He followed up. He is the guide here. Therefore, change is good. Therefore, change is social. You know that? I heard that, yes. You are producing some lessons here. Well, I have studied myself and all of your disciples and I... It's clear fact that we are all conditioned souls, so we cannot be glued. Maybe one day it may be possible, not now. Yes. I can do it. Now I am doing. I can say, now I will become a father, you become a father. I am waiting for you. You become all I want. I retire, complete. The train must be complete. So, you heard that from Srila Prabhupada's lotus lips. In April, of 1977, barely seven months before Srila Prabhupada departed from this planet, Tamalkrishna Goswami knew that nobody in ISKCON was qualified to become Guru. And Srila Prabhupada also confirmed his statement."

      "transcript": "So, let us hear what went on further in the conversation. The process of purification has begun. In the present times, you may have to throw everything away, but in the future, now I will tell you that He did not do that yet. He did not do that. So I have to tell you, He gave me money. He has told me, If you want to become a guru, come. Come to the life of God. You see, we are Gaurīmās. Everyone wants to become guru. And in small temple you have guru. That's all. No obligation, no preaching, simply brings a foodstuff, my Guru Mahārāj, joint mess, place for eating, our ātya khana, joint mess. Exactly. So we see here. Śrīla Prabhupāda emphasized that a rubber-stamped guru won't be effective. The key principle here is that to become guru, one must be ordered by one's guru. In other words, any person ordered by his guru to become guru is authorized. And any person who is not ordered by his guru, but he becomes guru, some or the other. Either by himself or somebody else tells him, or there is a body of some people who give him a no objection to become a guru, some or the other, he becomes guru, then he is not bona fide, he is rubber-stamped or unauthorized guru."

      "transcript": "Now, let us move on in history to the month of May in the same year, 1977. This month means that one has to take the terms of Jayasabila and Chandrasurga for every business Day of Ram. What had happened was, by May of 1977, Śrīla Prabhupāda's health had deteriorated considerably. Therefore, devotees had decided to shift Śrīla Prabhupāda to a more salubrious place, so that Śrīla Prabhupāda could recover from his limp念. So, they chose H capsule ministry. H capsule ministry in Uttarakhand? H capsule ministry in Uttarakhand? was the place which was chosen for Srila Prabhupada to recuperate. On the 7th of May in 1977, Srila Prabhupada left for Rishikesh by a night train. Overnight, they travelled from Delhi to Rishikesh. And there in Rishikesh, they had taken a place on rent and some few devotees and Prabhupada was staying there. While they were staying there, on the 14th of May, in the night, there was a fierce thunderstorm. There was a power cut. It was pitch black in the night and there was lightning, thunder and strong winds were blowing the whole night. Devotees were all shaken up. The next day, on May 15th, Srila Prabhupada called the devotees and instructed them, to make his will. So now, this was a clear indication that Srila Prabhupada had decided to leave the material world. Now, the very next day after that, on the 16th of May, Srila Prabhupada again called the devotees. At 2.30 am, Prabhupada was sitting up straight on his bed and he said, if I am going to die, then let it be in Vrindavan. Now, it was more clear what Srila Prabhupada had decided. So, the devotees immediately started making arrangements and maybe they could not arrange train tickets at such a short notice or for whatever reason, they got a car to take Srila Prabhupada to Vrindavan. So the same day, Srila Prabhupada was taken to Delhi by car. And there is Delhi in the evening. They stayed in Delhi for the night. And again in the morning, the next day, May 17th, they left from Delhi by car and went to Vrindavan. And in this way, Prabhupada reached Vrindavan on the 17th of May, 1977. There many of you who would have visited the Krishnabalram temple in the guest house, there is Prabhupada's quarters. And Prabhupada was staying there. Five days after reaching Vrindavan on the 22nd of May, Srila Prabhupada said, it is better to plan for the worst. And he called all the GBCs to come to Vrindavan. So based on this order of Prabhupada on 22nd of May, by May 28th, most of the GBC members had reached Vrindavan."

      "transcript": "And they held a meeting in Vrindavan. At that time in ISKCON, there were 23 GBC members. But only 18 were able to make it to Vrindavan for the meeting. After due deliberations in the meeting, the GBC chose five questions that they wanted answers from Srila Prabhupada for the time after his departure. So the 18 GBC members were present there. Noted down the five questions. they wanted to ask Srila Prabhupada. What were those questions? The questions were, number one, how long should GBC members remain in office? Number two, how can GBC members who leave be replaced? So actually, you see, these two questions are relevant only in Prabhupada's disappearance. Because as long as Prabhupada was there, the GBC members were continuing and whoever was leaving, Prabhupada was replacing them. So this question was coming up because in future, when Prabhupada is not there, how will they do it? Question number three, in the absence of Srila Prabhupada, what is the procedure for first, second and sannyas initiations? Question number four, what is the relationship of the person who gives this initiation to the person he gives it to? And question number five, the last question, is there any provision for publication of other translations of Vaishnava scriptures by the BBT after the departure of Srila Prabhupada? So we can see that all the five questions that were prepared by the GBC in that meeting on 28 May were all for the time after Srila Prabhupada left."

      "transcript": "Shaila Prabhupada's departure. Until May of 1977, Shaila Prabhupada appointed the GBCs. So, they wanted to know after Prabhupada's departure, how the GBCs would be appointed. Similarly, the other questions are also valid, especially for the time after Prabhupada's disappearance. Even the question on how initiations were to be conducted in ISKCON were also for the future, when Prabhupada was not there with us. Initiations had already been going on in ISKCON for 11 years, from 1966 till 1977. So, what was the need to ask how it would be conducted, unless it was for the time when Shaila Prabhupada was appointed? Shaila Prabhupada had departed when he was no longer with us. Otherwise, this question has no meaning. So, coming back to the meeting, the 18 GBC members then chose 7 senior-most devotees amongst them. These devotees were the ones who had been part of the original 12 GBC members chosen by Shaila Prabhupada in 1970. When the direction of management was formulated, which is how the GBC was born. So, these 7 members were to take these 5 questions to Shaila Prabhupada. In effect, the GBC meeting for these 5 questions was chaired by Shaila Prabhupada himself. Now, let us listen to the recording of this meeting between the 7 GBC members and Shaila Prabhupada. Where these 5 questions were put to Shaila Prabhupada. So, we will listen to that portion of the meeting, which is relevant to questions 3 and 4, which are related to initiations in ISKCON. Question number 3. In the absence of Shaila Prabhupada, what is the procedure for first, second and sannyas initiations? This was question 3. And what was question 4? What is the procedure to initiate, what is the relationship of the person, who gives this initiation to the person, he gives it to? This is the fourth question. A little bit of complicated, convoluted question, but nevertheless, these are the two questions that we will be focusing upon and here is"

However, let us try to understand the meeting proceedings a little better. However, let us take one question at a time. If you all recollect, there were two questions, question number three and question number four. So, let us take one question at a time and see what Srila Prabhupada's reply to it was. Question number three, we will take this up first. What was question number three? Satsvarupa, by the votes of the present GBC. Then, our next question concerns initiations in the future. Particularly, at that time, when you are no longer with us, we want to know how first and second initiation would be conducted. This was question number three, put forth by Satsvarupa Das. Prabhupada responded, yes, I shall recommend some of you. After this is settled up, I shall recommend some of you to act as officiating. Are you ready? This was Prabhupada's immediate response. And Tamalkrishna responded to that. Is that called Rithvik Acharya? And Prabhupada said, Rithvik, yes. Prabhupada actually corrected him. Tamalkrishna Goswami said, Rithvik Acharya. Prabhupada said, no, it is Rithvik. Rithvik, yes. So, with this, the response to question three ended. It is very obvious. And clear, that Shaila Prabhupada's response was crystal clear. And there was no doubt about Prabhupada's response in the minds of the GBC present. So, question three and its response, very clear, no ambiguity. Immediately after this, Satsvarupa Das and Tamalkrishna went on to the next question. So, it is as clear as daylight that Shaila Prabhupada was going to appoint him. He was going to appoint officiating Acharyas or Rithviks, not Diksha Gurus."

Prabhupada immediately responded with officiating Acharyas. A clear, straight question and a clear, straight answer. And we all know that Shaila Prabhupada did choose eleven people to act as Rithvik, representative of the Acharya, which, in other words, is officiating Acharya. And when did Shaila Prabhupada do this? He did this in the July 9th, 1977 directive. Hence, the July 9th directive appointing Rithviks is not a temporary arrangement, but it is meant for the time, particularly when Shaila Prabhupada is appointed. It is not a temporary arrangement. But it is meant for the time, particularly when Shaila Prabhupada is appointed. It is meant for the time, particularly when Shaila Prabhupada is appointed."

This question, as we saw earlier, is framed in a little convoluted manner. They could have asked a clear and straight question. Whose disciple are those who are getting initiated? Instead, they came up with this. Satsarupadas started, reading out the fourth question. Then, what is the relationship of that person who gives the initiation and the he came to only that much, Prabhupada interrupted him. So, this was a complicated question. And, naturally, complicated question will get a complicated reply. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. So, Shaila Prabhupada's reply to this question can be split into two. In the first part, Shaila Prabhupada gives the principle. The same principle which he mentioned in the April 22nd meeting with Tamalkrishna Goswami, which we have gone through already. So, this April 22nd meeting discussion with Tamalkrishna Goswami happened just about a month before this May 28th meeting. In that meeting, in that discussion, as well as here, Shaila Prabhupada quoted Amar Ajnayi verse and stressed on the fact that without order of the predecessor Guru, no one can become Guru. This is an inviolable principle. So, now, let us see what is Prabhupada's response to Satswaroop Dasa's question. Prabhupada, he is Guru. He is Guru, Satswaroop. But he does it on your behalf. Prabhupada, yes, that is formality. Because in my presence, one should not become Guru. So, on my behalf, on my order, Amar Ajnayi Guru Haya. Be actually Guru, but by my order. So, here, we can clearly see that Prabhupada is reiterating the same principle which he discussed in the April 22nd meeting. April 22nd discussion between Prabhupada and Tamalkrishna Goswami."

      "transcript": "Without one's Guru's order, no one can become Guru. Shaila Prabhupada was stating this principle. Another point to note here is that Satswaroop Dasa wanted to ask what is the relationship between the Rithvik and the devotee who is getting initiated. But instead, he ended up asking, what is the relationship between the person who gives initiation and the disciple? Actually, in Shaila Prabhupada's mind, it is clear that there are two people. One who gives initiation, which is Shaila Prabhupada, and the other one who officiates, which is the Rithvik. So, when Satswaroop Dasa asked what is the relationship of the person who gives initiation, and the disciple, Shaila Prabhupada immediately said that he is Guru. What does that mean? The person who is giving initiation, the initiator is the Guru. And the officiator is the Rithvik. Initiator is Shaila Prabhupada and he is Guru. It is very clear, abundantly clear. Now, in the second part of this session, of this conversation, of this reply, Satswaroop Dasa and Tamalkrishna Goswami wanted to clearly know if the disciples are theirs or Shaila Prabhupada's. So, the first part of the reply did not yield the response they were looking for. So, they wanted to see if they can eke out something which they were looking for. Because, in the first part of this reply, Prabhupada only spoke about the principle, Amarajnaya Guruhaya and all that. So, Satswaroop Dasa wanted to clarify. So, Satswaroop, so they may also be considered your disciples. Prabhupada, yes, they are disciples. Why consider who? Tamalkrishna intervened. No, he is asking that these Rithvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving Diksha. There, the people who they give Diksha to, whose disciple are they? So, you have to understand this question by Tamalkrishna Goswami. Here, Tamalkrishna Goswami sensed the difference in understanding between Satswaroop Dasa and Shaila Prabhupada. When Satswaroop Dasa asked, what is the relationship of the person who gives initiation, he was referring to the officiator, the Rithvik. But Prabhupada, he referred to the initiator, which was himself. So, Tamalkrishna Goswami understood. And he intervened with the clarification that they were asking about the Rithvik, not the one who gives initiation."

He is grand disciple. Satswaroop, yes. Tamalkrishna, that's clear. Satswaroop, immediately, he is going to the next question. Then, we have a question concerning, Prabhupada has still not completed. He intervenes. When I order you become Guru, he becomes regular Guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. Now, this appears a little confusing. The moment Shaila Prabhupada said, they are his disciple, Tamalkrishna Goswami and Satswaroop Das felt that the response that they had wanted to hear has now come. They wanted to close the reply and go to the next question. Looks like they were not aware that Shaila Prabhupada had not finished his reply and they ended up interrupting Prabhupada. So, if we remove the interruptions, which are simply repetitions of whatever Prabhupada said, they are his disciple, they are his disciple. Then, Shaila Prabhupada's reply looks like this. Tamalkrishna, no. He is asking that these Rithvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving Diksha. There, the people who they give Diksha to, whose disciple are they? Prabhupada. They are his disciple. Who is initiating? He is grand disciple. When I order, you become Guru. He becomes regular Guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it."

      "transcript": "So, when we remove the interruptions, the conversation looks like this. Now, in the last part, one option of Shaila Prabhupada's reply is, who is initiating? He is grand disciple. But the phrase, who is initiating? He is grand disciple, doesn't make any sense at all. I am initiating someone. How do I become my own grand disciple? It doesn't make sense. So, what is the other option? The other option is, that it must be, they are his disciple who is initiating. Now, this option, they are his disciple who is initiating, makes perfect sense and is completely in sync with what Shaila Prabhupada said earlier, that the disciples are his. He is the initiator and whoever is initiating, the disciples belong to him. There are two people here. One is the initiator. The other is the officiator. Shaila Prabhupada is the initiator and Tamalkrishna Goswami, Satsarup Das and others were going to become the officiators. So, whose disciple are they? They are the disciples of the initiator who is giving the initiation, which is Shaila Prabhupada. So then, the conversation looks like this. Let us take a look at it in light of this. Tamalkrishna, now, he is asking that these Ritvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving Diksha. There, the people who they give Diksha to, whose disciple are they? Prabhupada. They are his disciple who is initiating. He is grand disciple. When I order you become Guru, he becomes regular Guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. Now, the conversation is beginning to make sense. This means, Prabhupada goes on to clarify that only when he orders someone to become Guru, saying you become Guru, then only he becomes Guru and the question of disciple of Prabhupada's disciple arises. Prabhupada is again stating the same principle, Amarajnaya, which Prabhupada spoke in the first half of the reply, which we have already seen. So, now, the entire thing makes perfect sense. Otherwise, you see, a few seconds earlier, when Satsarupadas asked, so, they may also be considered your disciples. When Satsarupadas asked this, what was Srila Prabhupada's reply? Srila Prabhupada replied, yes, they are disciples. Why consider? To think that Srila Prabhupada first said that the disciples are his and then changed it to disciple of his disciple in a matter of few seconds does not make sense at all. However, when we see that Srila Prabhupada is stressing that the disciples are his and that they can become their disciple only when he orders, it becomes crystal clear that Srila Prabhupada is consistent throughout the discussion."

      "transcript": "Now that we have understood the real meaning of this conversation, let us go through it once again, beginning with question 3. Satsarupa, then our next question concerns initiations in the future, particularly at that time when you are no longer with us. We want to know how first and second initiation will be conducted. Prabhupada, yes, I shall recommend some of you. After this is settled up, I shall recommend some of you to act as officiating Acharyas. Tamalkrishna, is that called Rithvik Acharya? Prabhupada, Rithvik, yes. So, here the reply to question 3 ended. So, Prabhupada is going to appoint a Rithvik. Appoint only Rithviks, not Diksha Gurus. Then Satsarupa starts with question number 4. Satsarupa, then what is the relationship between the person who gives the initiation and the... So, he said, who gives the initiation. He did not say who officiates. So, because he used the word initiation, Prabhupada replied, he is Guru. He is Guru. Meaning, the person who gives the initiation, which is Prabhupada, is the Guru. But Satsarupa has misunderstood. He is thinking the person who is giving initiation is the Rithvik. So, he says, but he does it on your behalf. So, Prabhupada understands that he is now referring to the officiator, the Rithvik. So, Prabhupada says, yes, that is formality because in my presence one should not become Guru. So, on my behalf, on my order, Amar Adnyai Guruhaya, be actually Guru but by my order. So, Prabhupada is stating two principles here. One is, in Prabhupada's presence one should not become Guru. So, anyway, he cannot become Guru. And another principle is, Amar Adnyai Guruhaya, you can become Guru but only against Prabhupada's order. Satswarupa, so they may also be considered your disciples. Prabhupada, yes, they are disciples. Why consider who? So, Prabhupada still has not changed this stance that there is an officiator who will represent Prabhupada and Prabhupada will give diksha and the disciples will be his. So, he is saying, yes, they are disciples. Why consider who? So, Tamalkrishna understood now. Okay, Satswarupa has got confused. So, he, jumped in, clarifying. No, he is asking that these Ritvik Acharyas, they are officiating, giving diksha. They are the people who they give diksha to. Whose disciple are they? Prabhupada. They are his disciple who is initiating. So, you see, Prabhupada is throughout consistently saying the person who is initiating which is Prabhupada, the disciples belong to him. That means disciples belong to Prabhupada. He is grand disciple. When I order, you become guru. He becomes regular guru. That's all. He becomes disciple of my disciple. That's it. So, again, Prabhupada stated the principle. Don't expect that they will become your disciples. When I order you become guru, then you become regular guru. At that time, he will become disciple of my disciple. So, we can see here clearly that when we look at the conversation of the disciples, they are completely free from any sort of confusion. So, now, there is no confusion. It is very clear Prabhupada did not order anyone to become disciple of disciple or to become guru."

Whether the disciples belong to Srila Prabhupada or they become disciples, it is not clear. So, no matter whatever the lack of clarity in the reply to question 4, the reply to question 3, there was never any doubt. It was crystal clear and it was accepted to be so by all the GBC members present there. What was that? That they would be rithwiks and not diksha gurus. None of them had any question. So, it is irrefutable that Srila Prabhupada appointed gurus or diksha gurus or acharyas. He only appointed officiating acharyas or rithwiks. Now, the hypothetical confusion is with regard to only question 4. And what is that question 4? The question 4 is what is the relationship between the rithwik and the person getting diksha or initiation. This is where confusion hypothetically is. It is shown that there is no confusion. Even if such confusion is there, all such confusion was completely cleared by Srila Prabhupada when he chose the first 11 rithwiks through his directive on July 9, 1977. In that directive, Srila Prabhupada not only appointed 11 rithwiks but he also made it amply clear there what is the relationship between the rithwik and the disciple. So, that confusion about the relationship between the rithwik and the disciple was also cleared by Srila Prabhupada on July 9. So, what remains? However, despite the so-called confusion in the response to question 4, here is what the rithwik recorded. Srila Prabhupada said he will appoint several devotees who shall perform initiation in the future even after his disappearance. The disciples they accept shall be their disciples and Srila Prabhupada will be their grand spiritual master. Actually, this is not what Prabhupada said. Anyway, this is what they recorded in the minutes book. The seven members came back and whatever they said got entered into the minutes book. And all the 18 members present there signed the minutes. But, they did not take Srila Prabhupada's signature on the minutes. That was a grave omission. After all, all the devotees in all fairness, in an ideal case, Srila Prabhupada's signature was essential on the minutes. But, they did not take it. Devotees, in fact, did try to take Srila Prabhupada's signature on that minutes. But, see for yourself what happened. This is what happened. He states, Jyadvaita Maharaj did say strongly that I had better get this in writing from Srila Prabhupada. He said this was very important and that it was really not clear. He said that unless it was in writing, it would be contested by devotees later. I was not clear to me. But, Jyadvaita Maharaj insisted that I get it in writing from Prabhupada."

      "transcript": "So, on his advice, I thought he must be right that it was very serious. I went down to Tamalkrishna Maharaj and asked about it. I asked Tamalkrishna Maharaj to please understand that Prabhupada picked the regular gurus when he named the persons who would initiate while he was still with us. Tamalkrishna Maharaj replied that he himself knew very well what Prabhupada intended and that was good enough for him. So, he continues, I tried again to ask him, to ask Prabhupada to sign something, but Tamalkrishna was not willing. So, you see, Tamalkrishna Goswami stalled, obstructed the demand to get Srila Prabhupada's signature on the GBC minutes. Maybe he knew what would happen if they did that. Srila Prabhupada gave clear directions in the July 9, 1977 Directive. Those instructions are unequivocal. We cannot go by what the GBC recorded in the minutes book because it is not countersigned by Srila Prabhupada. Again, for hypothetical argument's sake, if we assume that Srila Prabhupada did indeed want his signature as it was recorded in the minutes of the GBC in writing, one thing is very very clear. The GBC recorded in their minutes that Srila Prabhupada will appoint devotees who shall perform initiations in the future. This is what that recording says. But, did that appointment come from Srila Prabhupada or their grand disciples of Srila Prabhupada? Fact is that the appointment of gurus never came from Srila Prabhupada. Hence, there is no basis for the guru system which was implemented in ISKCON in 1978 nor the one which is currently running. Both are only rubber stamped in 1977 for rittviks not for gurus not for diksha gurus. And in that directive, very clearly it is mentioned that the disciples will be Srila Prabhupada's disciples not the rittviks."

His Divine Grace has so far given a list of eleven disciples who will act in that capacity. And then the list of the eleven names was written down in the letter. These were the eleven names. And the letter continues. In the past, temple presidents have returned to Srila Prabhupada recommending the first and second initiation to whichever of these eleven representatives are nearest their temple. After considering the recommendation, these representatives may accept the devotee as an initiated disciple of Srila Prabhupada by giving a spiritual name or in the case of second initiation by chanting on the Gayatri thread just as Srila Prabhupada has done. The newly initiated devotees are disciples of His Divine Grace who receives a letter from these representatives giving the spiritual name or the thread.

Guru Kripa to Bhagawan Why don't we go and ask Lord Krishna? Let's go and see Prabhupada and clarify this Hrithik Acharya thing. Tamal Krishna to Guru Kripa. Prabhupada is not well. Besides, I think he is busy. Let's not disturb him with this. Let's see the next few days, who also recollect about this Hrithik incident. One of them is Gouridas Pandit Prabhu who recalls in On My Behalf. So Gouridas Pandit next morning, July 8th, if there should be Vyasasans for the Ritwiks in the temples. So July 7th was a conversation where Prabhupada gave all the names, which finally appeared on the July 9th directive. But on the intervening day on July 8th, Tamalkrishna Goswami had further questions to ask, so that when he finally made the July 9th letter, all these things could go in. So, on July 9th, he asked them in the next morning, on July 8th, if there should be Vyasasans for the Ritwiks in the temple. Srila Prabhupada said, no, that would create enmity amongst my disciples. Tamalkrishna Goswami also asked Srila Prabhupada if there could be more Ritwiks in the future. Srila Prabhupada said that more could be appointed by the GBC at Mayapur. Tamalkrishna Goswami asked Srila Prabhupada what to do if a Ritwik falls down and Srila Prabhupada replied that, the GBC could remove them. I told some of the devotees what I heard about this and Yashodha Nandan wrote it down in his diary. So, actually, you see, appointment or removal of the Ritwiks is not a major issue. Because if we need more Ritwiks, how will we decide we need more Ritwiks? It is when there are too many devotees to be initiated and whatever number of Ritwiks we have now, it is not sufficing. So, you increase the number of Ritwiks. It is purely based on demand. And when you have to manage demand and supply, it is called management. And the GBC is a managerial body. It will manage appointment as well as removal of the Ritwiks. And that's why Prabhupada's July 9th directive did not talk about appointing or removal of the Ritwiks because the GBCs could do it."

On July 8th, Yashodha Nandan Prabhu wrote in his diary, Tamalkrishna Maharaj was talking about the Ritwik gurus to initiate on behalf of Prabhupada after he leaves the planet. And on July 9th, Yashodha Nandan Prabhu wrote in his diary. I heard from Tamalkrishna Maharaj in the afternoon, that Sri Prabhupada had told him to send a letter to all temples to explain the Ritwik system for the future. The next day, on 10th of July, Yashodha Nandan Prabhu wrote in his diary, Tamalkrishna Maharaj had written on behalf of Sri Prabhupada to issue a letter to all the temples to explain the Ritwik system for the future. Tamal Krishna Maharaj comes out of Prabhupada's room and the conversation goes like this. Tamal Krishna Maharaj, Haribol, Yesodha, did you see this? Yesodha, no, what is it? Tamal Krishna Goswami. This is signed by Prabhupada. Yesodha Nandan Prabhu, what does all this mean? Tamal Krishna Goswami. Devotees have been writing to Prabhupada asking for initiations and now Prabhupada has named 11 Ritwiks who can initiate on his behalf. Prabhupada said, others can be added. Yesodha Nandan Prabhu. And when Prabhupada disappears, Tamal Krishna Goswami, they will be Ritwiks. That is what Prabhupada said. It is all on tape. And this is what Gauridas Pandit Prabhu has recorded in his On My Behalf. So you see, Tamal Krishna Goswami said, devotees have been writing to Prabhupada asking for initiations. So actually what had happened, after the May 28th conversation, it was clear to everyone. That Prabhupada was going to appoint Ritwiks. So all the initiations were put on hold. And by July 7th, lot of requests had become pending. And that is how Tamal Krishna Maharaj went and asked Prabhupada, what to do now? May 28th, already Prabhupada had said that he is going to appoint some Ritwiks, but that had not happened. And they did not know what to do now. They were waiting. So Prabhupada then, on July 7th, gave the names for the Ritwiks. So when Tamal Krishna Maharaj said, got it, he told Yashodha Nandan Prabhu, devotees have been writing to Prabhupada asking for initiations and now Prabhupada has named 11 Ritwiks who can initiate on his behalf. And Prabhupada said, others can be added. By whom? Naturally by the GBC. In another testimony by His Holiness Chyavana Swami on his Facebook page on September 7th, 2016, he gave a testimony. According to his testimony, Srila Prabhupada said, I will continue to accept this. I will have millions of disciples and give them my blessings. Even after I am no longer physically present, you may initiate them on my behalf."

Yet another devotee from Srila Prabhupada coined the term Ritwik, which was an article on Vaishnava News Network on December 1st, 1998. One devotee, Pitha Prabhu, recollected in 1998, The fact of the matter was, Srila Prabhupada made himself very clear on how new devotees coming into his movement were to be accepted into it after his disappearance. The word Ritwik was first heard by me from Srila Prabhupada's lotus mouth and His Divine Grace used the term many times during his last two weeks in Vandavan. I remember this clearly. Because I didn't know what a Ritwik was. This is Pitha Prabhu. Another devotee, Lochanananda Prabhu, in his book, Srila Prabhupada's Hidden Glories, he writes, One other thing Pitha Prabhu mentioned in the same letter to Lochanananda Prabhu was that he heard Srila Prabhupada say at least a dozen times in Vandavan in 1977 that initiation should be performed after his departure. by the Ritwik Acharya. So, you can see there are multiple devotees who recollect Prabhupada saying that the future initiations, even after his disappearance, would continue to be done by the Ritwiks. Now, let us see what a third party, a person not connected to ISKCON, had to say on this appointment. This is B. V. Puri Maharaj from Sri Chaitanya Chandra Ashram. This is B. V. Puri Maharaj from Sri Chaitanya Chandra Ashram. This is B. V. Puri Maharaj from Sri Chaitanya Chandra Ashram. He recollects a conversation with Srila Prabhupada that he had in late 1977. B. V. Puri Maharaj, Maharaj, you have established 11 Gurus. There is no harmony. There can be no harmony. Guru must be one. You have selected 11 Gurus. Srila Prabhupada, I have not selected. I have appointed 11 Ritwiks. So, even someone outside of ISKCON was very clear and certain."

This is the opening line of the July 9th directive. So, this opening line refers to the recent meeting of the GBC with Srila Prabhupada.
