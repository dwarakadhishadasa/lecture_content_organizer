Then he amalgamated all the sense organs into the mind. Then the mind emulsified. Then the body into life, life into breathing, his total existence into the embodiment of the five elements, and his body into death. Then, as pure self, he became free from the material conception of life. The translation sounds very, very technical, but Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains all these terms in the purport. So let us go through the purport and try to understand this in a simple manner which Prabhupada explains."

      "transcript": "So the purport by Srila Prabhupada is as follows: Maharaja Yudhishthira, like his brother Arjuna, began to concentrate and gradually became freed from all material bondage. So, becoming free from material bondage means becoming free from the material conception of life. What is material conception of life? Actually, I am spirit soul, or you are spirit soul. Each person is spirit soul, but I wrongly think I am this body. I wrongly think I belong to this world, because the fact is, as spirit soul, I don't belong to this world. I belong to Krishna. I belong to Krishnaloka. I have a permanent, eternal, loving relationship with Krishna, but in my present condition, I have forgotten Krishna. I have forgotten that relationship. I have forgotten who I am. I have forgotten who is Krishna. I have forgotten what is my relationship with Krishna. I have forgotten the spiritual world, and by association with this material world, I identify I belong to this world. Because I have taken birth in a certain family, I identify I belong to this family. Now, this family itself, consisting of the family members, my mother, my father, my brothers, my sisters, my aunts, my uncles, my neighbors, my friends, my well-wishers, all this is developed around a false conception that I am the body."

      "transcript": "You can easily understand. Without this body, is there any meaning to relationships? You just think about it. Without the body, there is no meaning to a relationship. So, all these relationships, my father, my mother, my family, or my friend, my neighbor, my relatives, everything is based on my conception that I am thinking I am this body. So, to become free from material bondage means to become freed from the wrong conception of the self, of who I am, and that is made possible by different methods of spiritual practice. Now, don't think that becoming free from material bondage is to completely destroy all our relationships, our responsibilities, our duties, our affection. No, it's not that. Please don't misunderstand that way."

Not to simply negate, but to understand the relative importance. There is a certain importance for this human form of body, because only in the human form of body, it is possible for me as spirit soul to hear, understand, I am not this body. So, the body is also important. In my present condition, body is important, but it doesn't have absolute importance because it's temporal. It's going to perish. It's not going to remain with me forever. So, before it perishes, I should actually come out of this misconception that I am the body. Otherwise, what will happen? Supposing I don't come out of the misconception, then I have to face death, which means I am forced to leave this body. What is death? I don't die. As spirit soul, I don't die. This you have heard many times in the Bhagavad Gita."

      "transcript": "It's clearly explained. Only a devotee, at the time of death, because he understands I am not the body, he is also able to understand now I am leaving the body. And depending on Krishna, if I leave the body, then Krishna will guide me and take me to my next body and I continue my devotional service in my next body, provided I was engaged in devotional service in my previous body, and I have cultivated the desire to continue my devotional service even after quitting the body. So that's the devotional process. Now, as far as Yudhishthira is concerned, there is a technical difference in the process Yudhishthira Maharaj is actually employing for becoming detached. Let's hear what is Yudhishthira Maharaj doing. First he concentrated all the actions of the senses and amalgamated them into the mind."

      "transcript": "What is the meaning of this? All our senses are centered about the mind. It is the mind which directs the senses. You have heard this earlier. So if the mind is directing the senses, if the misconception around this body and based on the bodily actions of the senses, I try to derive happiness. I try to avoid suffering. I try to gather knowledge. I try to use my intelligence, etc, etc. So many things. Now, this has to be replaced with spiritual understanding of my spiritual self, spiritual intelligence, spiritual mind, spiritual senses, everything spiritual, which is inside. Not these material senses, material body, material mind, material intelligence. No, not this. This is a covering for the real mind, the spiritual mind, the spiritual senses, the spiritual intelligence, the spiritual self. It's a covering for all that. So to actually uncover, to remove the covering, to become free from the covering is possible, first of all, by concentrating all the actions of the senses and amalgamating means gathering them and mixing them with the mind, mixing them with the mind, so that these senses I no longer identify as my senses, these material senses."

My spiritual senses are there, and I am using my spiritual senses through these material senses in my material condition. So stop using your spiritual senses through your material senses. That's what Yudhishthira is doing. So he doesn't want to anymore use his spiritual senses through his material senses. He doesn't want to use that. Similarly, so what does this mean in terms of devotional service? Prabhupada says, or in other words, he turned his mind towards the transcendental service of the Lord. He prayed that since all material activities are performed by the mind in terms of actions and reactions of the material senses, and since he was going back to Godhead, the mind would wind up its material activities and be turned towards the transcendental service of the Lord."

      "transcript": "See, there is the gross body and the subtle body. The gross body consists of this gross senses of action and senses of perception, karmendya and jnanindya. The subtle body consists of the mind, material mind, material intelligence, and material ego. So, when this material mind is turned towards transcendental service of the Lord, then the material mind will no longer be engaged in any material activities or material perceptions, material objects, nothing, because now Yudhishthira has nothing to do with the material world. He is handed over charge. He is handed over charge to his grandson and to Vajra, Krishna's great-grandson, all the charge of ruling, and he is prepared to quit home after placing the fire of renunciation in his heart, deciding to become completely renounced, preparing for going back to Godhead. Why all this? Preparing for going back to Godhead, quitting this body. So before he quits the body, the attachments have to be cut off. All the links have to be cut off, which were established when he entered the body. So how they cut off the link? By spiritualizing this material mind, by engaging it in transcendental service."

Here, using the mind, mindfully chant, attentively hear, mindfully hear. So that way the mind turns towards the transcendental service of the Lord. The Harinama Japa, Harinama Kirtana, Hare, devotional service, Krishna Seva. That way the mind becomes spiritualized, and when the mind is spiritualized, there is no longer any need for me, a spirit soul, to utilize these material senses for any material activities. Even if I use the material senses, I'll use it only for devotional service. There was no longer any need for material activities, because he decided to stop all material activities. So I will stop here. We'll discuss this same verse more in the next session. Thank you very much."
