If you invite somebody to your house, you delightfully welcome them. Not that you're, you know, like a very, somehow okay, I have to invite them. Not like that. You delightfully invite them. Two ways you can do. Delightfully you can invite them, or some social obligation is there. We have to call them, let them come. No, it's not like that. You have to delightfully call them. So in the same way, the Holy name is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Supreme Personality is no supreme. There's no person superior to Him. So that Supreme Personality of Godhead, we also used another important word which brings out a kind of, we can relate with that feeling. What is that? Like a V-I-P. So infinite V's, I-P. So Krishna is like a I-I-P, most important person, infinitely important person. Suppose in your house someone comes. Let's say somebody whom you admire so much and he is a role model for you. He comes to your house. You will be delighted, not a. You will be delighted to receive him, and you will relish his association. You will want to relish his association. You want to hear from him or you want to relish his association. And then you are going to be very enthusiastic till he leaves, you want to be enthusiastic to serve him. So that, you know, there is a relationship built, there is a pleasure of serving him. So take this, understand these three things: One is delight, delightfully welcoming, relishing the association, enthusiastically serving."
