Kutap Unar Grunato Namatasya Mahatam Aikanta Parayanasya Yo Ananta Shaktir Bhagavanananto Mahat Gunatvadhyam Anantam Ahuhu. The meaning of this verse is: And what to speak of those who are under the direction of the great devotees chanting the holy name of the unlimited who has unlimited potency. The personality of Godhead, unlimited in potency and transcendental by attributes, is called the Ananta or unlimited. So here Suta Goswami is describing the potency of chanting the holy name of the unlimited Lord. What is that potency? It completely purifies all contamination and elevates them."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/MXzFvTU1ncI?t=117",
      "transcript": "So in the purport, Prabhupada says, the Dvija Bandhu, or the less intelligent uncultured men born of higher caste, put forward many arguments against the lower caste men becoming Brahmanas in this life. They argue that birth in a family of Shudras or less than Shudras is made possible by one's previous sinful acts and that one therefore has to complete the terms of disadvantages due to lower birth. What does it mean? If somebody is taking birth in a Shudra family, that is because of their past sinful activities or past life, karma. So there is a basis for somebody to take birth in a Shudra family and somebody else to take birth in a Brahmana family. Yes, agreed. There is a definite basis for such birth to happen. It is not accidental, it is not blind, no. The argument by those born in Brahmin families, they say that if somebody is taken such a birth, they have to complete the life in that body that they have acquired. And only in the next birth, if they take birth in a Brahmana family, then they may be accepted as a Brahmana. Not before that, but here something else is told. So Prabhupada says to answer these false logicians, Srimad Bhagavatam asserts that one who chants the holy name of the Lord and the direction of a pure devotee can at once get free from the disadvantages due to a lower caste birth. Even though some, we may admit that somebody born in a low class family due to their past misdeeds or past karma, still, when they chant the holy name of the Supreme Lord under the direction of a pure devotee, they become free from all such material contamination due to the low birth."

      "transcript": "A pure devotee of the Lord does not commit any offense while chanting the holy name of the Lord. It is a characteristic of a pure devotee. It is a characteristic of a pure devotee. His chanting is pure. It means no offenses. What is the meaning of offense? Offense is like blaspheming devotees who have dedicated their life for preaching Krishna consciousness. That is an offense against the holy name. Or criticizing or minimizing the value of Vedic literature. This is also an offense against the holy name. Like that. There are different offenses to be considered while chanting Hare Krishna. And if somebody while chanting does not commit any offense, such a person is actually a pure devotee of the Lord. So, Prabhupada says there are ten different offenses in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. This is an elaborate subject, but separately we can discuss what are the ten offenses and how to avoid them. There are ten different offenses mentioned in the Padma Purana. To chant the holy name under the direction of a pure devotee is offenseless chanting."

And therefore, such chanting can at once purify one, at once purify a person from the effects of all kinds of previous sins. The sins get washed away. The residual sinful reactions are washed away, no matter how much it may be. That's the special thing about chanting under the direction of a pure devotee. That's very special. So therefore, we request everyone, you please receive the holy name from Prabhupada and you chant according to his instructions and directions. Okay. Then immediately you become purified of all sinful reactions."

      "transcript": "But one should not again commit sins after being cleansed by simply chanting Hare Krishna according to Prabhupada's directions. It is not mechanical. It's not automatic. One has to endeavor to give up sin. To give up the sinful activities and then chant the Hare Krishna mantra under proper guidance and direction, then one can derive the highest benefit. The offenseless chanting indicates that one is purified. It indicates that one has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name and has thus surrendered unto the Lord. How does all this work? That's what Prabhupada is explaining here. Offenseless chanting means the person who is chanting in that way has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name. The holy name when uttered by any person simply by vibrating the tongue, Hare Krishna, the holy name is uttered. Hare Krishna. Then it's no ordinary sound vibration. It is actually transcendental sound. But a devotee who chants offenselessly, he understands the spiritual nature of the holy name. And what does he do consequently? He surrenders completely to the supreme law."

If a person stops sinning and takes to Krishna consciousness and follows the directions of the pure devotee and chants Hare Krishna, then guaranteed such persons will become pure devotees. Now here the glories of the holy name. The holy name of the Lord is as powerful as the Lord. It looks like a very simple sound, Hare Krishna, two, two syllables. Anybody can vibrate the tongue and say Hare Krishna. But that sound, when somebody produces the sound Hare Krishna, that sound is actually very, very powerful, pure, transcendental sound. It's definitely potent like that. So Prabhupada says the Lord is all powerful personality of Godhead and he has innumerable names which are all non-different from him and are equally powerful also. Because the Lord is absolute. There is no difference between his personal names."

So, such names are identical with the Lord, and they are also very, very powerful, as powerful as he is. So therefore, Prabhupada says, in the last word of the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord asserts that one who surrenders fully to the Lord, he will not be able to do anything. Therefore, Prabhupada says, in the last word of the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord asserts that one who surrenders fully unto him is protected from all sins by the grace of the Lord. So, Krishna assures, I will free you from all sinful reactions. You simply surrender to me alone. Since, now Prabhupada explains this, how does it work? Since his name, means the Lord's name, and he himself, the Lord himself, are identical, the holy name of the Lord can protect the devotee from all effects of sins."
