This is the last session in which we will complete the discussion on these two verses. So we are discussing different sages who appeared there. Srila Prabhupada has given a brief biography of these sages. So the first chapter of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the next sage, Medha Tithi, an old sage of yore, an assembly member of the heavenly king Indra Deva. These devatas, they are always guided by great saintly persons. This is the system. Any ruler, any king, any responsible person in the administration is always guided by learned sages who never occupy the post of ruling or controlling or doing administration, but are well-versed in the science. So they give advice, they instruct, they guide, but they never accept any salary, they never take any remuneration. They don't expect any material benefit out of that. They are doing it as a seva, as a service. So this Medha Tithi was an assembly member of the heavenly king Indra Deva. His son was Kanvamuni, another great sage."

Of course, the ultimate goal of such elevation is to come to the point of achieving ultimate liberation by going back to Godhead. But those who adopt the gradual process of elevation of consciousness, they have to gradually go from the earth planet to the heavenly planet to the still higher planet, still higher planet, still higher planet.

He is directly transformed to Krishna's personal abode. So, those who don't know about this Bhakti Yoga process, or those who are not having the guidance of the spiritual master or master as the laity, master who is expert in Bhakti Yoga, such people have to follow the gradual process of elevation, the other process of Jnana, Karma, Ashtanga Yoga, Hatha Yoga, so many other, Sankhi Yoga, so many other yoga systems are there for the gradual process of elevation."

They are elevated to that post, they have their own planet in the upper part of the universe, Saptarishi Mandala. It's called Saptarishi Mandala. And Gautama Rishi is one of the Saptarishis. Sharadwaan Gautama was one of his sons. Now, Srila Prabhupada clarifies one very important point. Persons in the Gautama gotra today are either his family descendants or in his disciplic succession. Like those in the Vedic culture, they say, to which gotra do you belong? To which lineage? Lineage of ancestors. So, those belonging to Gautama gotra, generally a rishi's name is associated with the gotra. Gotra means this descendant of a particular sage. So, two kinds of descendants: those who are family descendants are the brahmanas. Just like Gautama Rishi, he had his sons and his sons had their sons, their sons, their sons, their sons. Like that in the brahmana lineage, present day brahmanas who are actually Gautama gotra descendants, they are coming from the Gautama Rishi himself as the descendants. And those who are Kshatriyas and Vaishyas who claim to be of Gautama gotra, they generally are having Gautama Rishi as their priest, as their preceptor, as their guide and saintly teacher. So, two kinds of descendants, those in the disciplic succession who follow Gautama Rishi"

Gautama Rishi was the husband of the famous Ahalya. Ahalya is a personality who was delivered by Rama or Ramachandra. So, it is described here that Ahalya turned into a stone when Indradeva, the king of heaven, molested her. You see, among the devatas, there is always this enviousness because there is so much material desires for enjoyment. Sometimes they become envious. Ahalya was the wife of Gautama Rishi. But because Indra wanted to enjoy with her, because she is a chaste lady, she will refuse to satisfy Indra. This is the instruction in the scriptures that another's wife should be respected on the level of one's mother. So, there is a question of enjoying. So, similarly, Indradeva, he should not have even approached the wife of Gautama Ahalya even though she might have been very beautiful. But he nevertheless approached her. When she refused, he molested her. He forced her. So, then she, by her chastity, she turned into a stone so that Indra could no longer do any more harm to her. And then she was delivered by Rama. When Rama touched her, she was delivered. When Rama was in exile, Ahalya was delivered by Lord Ramachandra. Gautama was the grandfather of Kripacharya who was one of the heroes of the battle of Kurukshetra."

      "transcript": "Then the last sage being described here is Maitreya Rishi, a great Rishi of yoga. He was the spiritual master of Vidura. In fact, most of the Bhagavatam, a good portion of the Bhagavatam is describing the conversation between Vidura and Maitreya, which is cited by Shukadeva Goswami. When Shukadeva Goswami was speaking the Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj, to answer some of Pariksit's questions, Shukadeva Goswami would cite a similar question was asked by someone else in the past. This is called parampara system. Nobody has to manufacture any answer for any question. The entire body of spiritual knowledge is descending from Krishna. Krishna first instructed Brahma, Brahma instructed Narada, Narada instructed Vyasa, Vyasa instructed Deja. Shukadeva Goswami and other personalities. So Vidura inquired from Maitreya Rishi when on pilgrimage. He met Maitreya Rishi in Badrikashram. And he inquired from Maitreya Rishi. Of course, Vidura himself is enlightened and learned, pure devotee, Mahabhagavata. He is one of the Mahajanas. But in order to teach us how we have to make inquiries from the right authority, from the right source, we have to acquire this knowledge of the Self, Brahmavidya. You cannot study Brahmavidya or become knowledgeable in the Brahmavidya simply by studying books, simply by doing some meditation and all that. You have to hear from a Self-realized soul. That is the only way and there is no other way. There is no substitute for that. So Vidura heard from Maitreya who was Self-realized. And that conversation is elaborately described in the later cantos of the Bhagavad Gita. So Maitreya Rishi is famous as the one who instructed Vidura in this spiritual subject matter, Brahmavidya."

Like Maitreya Rishi, he advised Dhritarashtra not to ill-treat the Pandavas because Dhritarashtra was a caretaker, so not to ill-treat his brother's sons, his nephews, but rather to keep good relations. Duryodhana disagreed and thus Maitreya Rishi cursed Duryodhana. Maitreya also met Vyasadeva and had religious discourses with Vyasadeva."
