When they arrived in Puri, Chaitanya Dasa and his wife paid their obeisances to Mahaprabhu. But before they could speak, the Lord himself said, understanding their desire, Jagannath Deva will surely fulfill all your desires. The other devotees were curious about what desire Mahaprabhu was talking about, and they asked his servant Govinda. But before he could say anything, Mahaprabhu called Govinda and gave him the answer. Chaitanya Dasa decides to have a son. Indeed, his wife will give birth to a jewel of a son, who will be named Srinivas. He will be the manifest form of my love and will be non-different from me. He will increase everyone's love. He will increase everyone's enthusiasm for devotion. Through Rupa and others, I will bring scriptures into the world, and through Srinivas, I shall distribute them."

Upon arriving in the Hindu kingdom of Pana Vishnupura, they felt that the danger was over. However, the rumor had reached the capital of Vishnupura that a rich merchant was traveling to Pulli with a valuable cargo of merchandise. The ruler of the kingdom led a gang of highwaymen, and when he heard that a cargo of great value was passing through his kingdom, he asked an astrologer to divine the truth of the rumors. The astrologer confirmed that this was indeed a cargo of great value. The king immediately sent a group of robbers to steal it, specifying that they should kill no one. The robbers first worshipped the goddess Chandi, then sent out a spy who returned to tell them that everyone in the group accompanying the ox-cart was sleeping in exhaustion. After eating their night meal, the robbers thought that this was surely Chandi's mercy, that a golden opportunity like this had come their way. They seized the ox-cart and the books, thinking they were gold and jewels, and turned them over to the king. When Vishnupura's king saw the large chest, he was delighted at the prospect of finding a large amount of valuables inside. How disappointed he must have been to see nothing but books inside. He turned to the astrologer and asked him how he could have made such a mistake. The astrologer answered, \"I cannot understand it. Every time I made my calculation, it came up with the same conclusion. This chest is full of priceless jewels. It is incredible. I don't know why my calculations have gone wrong. The mere sight of the holy books"

They searched everywhere, but when they failed to find any clue to the books' whereabouts, they felt so depressed that they considered killing themselves. Some local villagers saw the distressed condition of the three Vaishnavas and immediately suspected the robber king Veerahambira. Srinivasa made some further investigations and was assured that he would be able to find more information about the king himself. The three Vaishnavas felt some hope and abandoned their suicidal intentions. Srinivasa Acharya decided to remain in Vishnupura in the hope of finding the books, but he sent Narottama to Keturi and Shamananda to Orissa. While staying in Vishnupura, Srinivasa heard from a Brahmin named Krishna Vallabha that Veerahambira liked to listen to Srimad Bhagavatam and daily attended classes. On the next day, Srinivasa went with his Brahmin to the hall where the Bhagavata classes were held. The Brahmin introduced Srinivasa to the king as a great Vaishnava, and the king indeed observed the characteristics of the Brahmin. The king expressed a desire to hear Srinivasa speak on the Bhagavata, and Srinivasa agreed, thinking that this might be a good opportunity to recover the books. So he started to give"
