Person cuts and pastes only that and puts it. And people are criticizing Prabhupada. Oh, see, they have caste system. Simply bringing sentimentalism over, Shudra means you are lower than Brahmana. Especially, it has been rooted in western universities to deprecate India's culture and say that there is a caste system"

Somebody is a deputy manager. Somebody is a... His salary is different. His salary is different. Why do you want to say, this is, oh, this is caste system."

The modern caste system of Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, we also attack. Our form of attack is to tell them what is real Brahmana, what is Shudra within the society, in terms of guna and karma. We can say, okay, Westerners are talking like this. You also have a king. Then you had nobles. Then you had knights. And then you had next level ordinary people. So, this is also your... That means, historically, you had a caste system, no? There is a king, there is a noble, there is a knight, there is this hierarchy."

Here, we do not know who is Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, who is SC, ST, no, nobody knows, because it does not matter to us. Therefore, we are not curious to know."

And when you become a Vaishnava, even karma you cross, you will be able to do work which is not even your nature. If that work is for Krishna, you will transcend even karma. We do not care. Your birth is Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, we do not care. Come surrender to Krishna and develop Vaishnava culture, Brahmanical culture."
