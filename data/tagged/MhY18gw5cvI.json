They cannot be at multiple places at the same time, while Krishna does not have such limits. Yes. One thing, when it is Krishna, Krishna Deity body is Krishna's energy only. So for him, you know, to be in a Deity body is not an issue at all. He is present there and he can receive everything through the Deity, all these things."

      "transcript": "When it comes to the Demigods, the Lord Paramatma has given this special facility to them. Krishna says that one who, anybody who has faith in anybody, I am seated in their heart and I make that faith steady. So to facilitate this kind of even Demigod worship in this material world, the Demigods are given this power to know that there is a Deity of Ganesha being worshipped here. And then that doesn't mean that that Deity body is his. It is an image only. He knows it is an image. Image is different. Just like, you know, ordinary people, you take their photo. Photo is different. I am different. My photo is different. I am different."

Bhaktisiddhant's photo is in the altar. They are not photos. Because they have a spiritual body, they are non-different from that. They manifest in the substance itself. Just like Krishna manifests in the substance of the body. That is the Deity."

Devatas know that they are being worshipped in this temple, that temple, that temple. They know that their image is being worshipped. And therefore they are pleased with them."
