      "transcript": "Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Before that sound is vibrating in the air, there is no avatara. Lord is unmanifest everywhere; everywhere He is there. Avatara means He is manifest in the material element. So we have to make people chant so that we manifest the Lord in our dimension. On Hare Krishna hill, in Rajaji Nagar, in this particular address, with ordinary ears, with ordinary tongue, material tongue and material ears, we are able to touch the avatar of the Lord. Thousands of people are coming to this temple. They are also adding, they are not only benefiting themselves by going through the chanting mantap, they are contributing to the welfare of the entire Bangalore city. How do we understand? These things you have to see from the perspective of the scriptures. This is a kripa of the Lord."
