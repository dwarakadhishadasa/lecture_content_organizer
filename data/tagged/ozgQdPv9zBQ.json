      "transcript": "So this is a very touching scene. On the battlefield, after the battle is over, Bhishma is ready to quit his body. The Pandavas have come there, arrived there. The Pandavas were sitting near Bhishma Deva, overtaken with affection for their dying grandfather. The Pandavas could remember how Bhishma Deva actually took charge of their protection when Pandu died early, when the Pandavas were very young. So Bhishma took charge of the upbringing of the Pandavas. So they were naturally feeling so much affection for Bhishma Deva. They were very grateful. So Bhishma Deva met the Pandavas. And as far as Bhishma Deva is concerned, He was very happy to see the Pandavas getting back their kingdom, which was rightfully theirs. Only because of injustice by the Kauravas, the Pandavas were deprived so far of their kingdom. So Bhishma Deva... covered by the Kauravas. So far the Pandavas were deprived so far of their kingdom. So Bhishma Deva was overwhelmed with love and affection and there were tears in his eyes. He was very happy that the Pandavas got back their kingdom after the battle of Kurukshetra. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, when Maharaj Pandu died, his sons were all small children and naturally they were brought up under the affection of elderly members of the royal family, specifically by Bhishma Deva. This is the very culture that the joint family system that prevails. Earlier, especially in the ancient times, everyone was properly taken care of by the elderly members of the family, especially the younger ones were taken care of by the elderly members of the family."

      "transcript": "So in a joint family system, the elders are there to guide the youngsters in every respect. It's not that we learn only by going to a particular school or going for some specific skill development only. No, one can learn simply by being in the association of great personalities, of responsible people. Just by observing, just by being in the association, so many things can be learned. Now in the modern society, this joint family system is no longer prevalent and therefore the children are missing out a great deal of wisdom that they could have got from the elders of the family in a joint family system. In these nuclear families, if... let us say, the mother or the father is not at home, the children are deprived so much of elderly care. And the conditions are becoming worse when both the parents have to go to work and the children are under the care of some maids or some neighbors or some daycares."

      "transcript": "such as Bhishma Dev. up bringing of these Pandavas in the palace, Hastinapura palace. Later on when the Pandavas were grown up, they were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and company. The Kauravas, especially Duryodhana. Duryodhana was very very envious of the Pandavas. Very envious of the Pandavas, because he knew that even though his father was the caretaker king, because of Pandu's early death, and the Pandavas were not of age, they were not mature to assume the throne. So Bhishma had taken a vow never to occupy the throne. So Bhishma could not take charge of ruling. And then Dhritarashtra was disqualified because he was blind. But in the absence of a suitable king to rule the whole world in the Kuru dynasty, so Bhishma instructed Dhritarashtra to be the caretaker king. The son of Pandu will inherit from his father, the kingdom. Pandu was the eligible king when he was ruling, but he died early. And therefore, Yudhishthira had to take charge, but Yudhishthira had to wait. So in the meantime, this Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king. They were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and party. So many ways Duryodhana cheated the Pandavas by an unfair gambling match. And before that also, he was occupying the throne and giving the Pandavas some small place, some insignificant place, to rule. So it was just plain cheating. No doubt about it. But Bhishma Deva, even though he knew the Pandavas were innocent and were unnecessarily put into trouble, Bhishma Deva could not take the side of the Pandavas for political reasons. Bhishma was being maintained by Dhritarashtra and Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king. So Bhishma thought that since Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king, he could not take the side of the Pandavas for political reasons. So Bhishma was being maintained by Dhritarashtra and Dhritarashtra was the caretaker king."

So when Bhishmadeva saw his most exalted grandsons, the Pandavas, headed by Maharaja Yudhishthira, sitting very gently at his side, the great warrior grandfather could not check his loving tears which were automatically flowing from his eyes. So he was very very satisfied and happy that my grandsons, the Pandavas, who were cheated by Duryodhana, now they have got back their kingdom. They got back their kingdom. And Bhishmadeva knew it very well. The Pandavas are very very righteous, so virtuous, so they rule the kingdom perfectly. The citizens, the whole world will be benefited by Pandavas ruling the world. Krishna also wanted that. He wanted the Pandavas, his devotees, to rule the world. Not the non-devotee party of Duryodhana. No. That's why Krishna arranged the battle of Kurukshetra. And it is explained, Krishna arranged to assemble all those miscreants who had escaped the various times when Krishna was engaged in killing the demoniac natured persons. Krishna came to reduce the burden of the earth which was overburdened by demoniac forces. So all those who were remaining, they were assembled by Krishna's arrangement on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. All of them were killed. So Bhishma was very very happy. And Krishna arranged that Bhishma see the Pandavas after they had won the battle, and he could die peacefully, satisfied that there was justice ultimately for the Pandavas."
