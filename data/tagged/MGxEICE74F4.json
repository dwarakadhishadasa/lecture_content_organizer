And from home, they receive some simple food so that they are not bothered about preparing food, gathering the ingredients, etc. They can fully devote themselves for practicing tapasya, for studying the scriptures, for practicing austerity, etc."

      "transcript": "As the Paramahamsa is above all varnas and all ashramas, he's a pure devotee. Devotees who are fully devoted to serving Krishna without caring for any personal comforts, they are actually paramahamsas. So these strict rules of sannyas are not possible to be followed in Kali Yuga. Therefore, in Kali Yuga it is said sannyas is forbidden, but even the followers of Chaitanya, they accept the essence of this principle of sannyas, which is traveling and preaching, and some minimum rules of sannyas are accepted, but not all the rules, so that the preaching can be done without much difficulty, and that's our main business."
