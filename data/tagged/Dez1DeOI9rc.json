And simply you have to do that. What did Pariksit Maharaj do? He simply sat and heard Shukadev Goswami speak for 7 days and nights continuously. That's all he did. He didn't do any gymnastics. But he was hearing with complete attention. He was fully absorbed in the subject matter. So much so that Shukadev Goswami said, \"Do you want to take a break?\" He said, \"No. There is no need for any break because through my ears I'm drinking the nectar of the words of the Srimad Bhagavatam spoken by Shukadev Goswami.\" So that nectar makes one indifferent to thirst, hunger, sleep, all these things cannot disturb a person who's completely immersed."

Prabhupada says, \"There are various senses of which the ear is the most effective ear. This sense works even when a man is deep asleep. One can protect himself from the hands of an enemy while awake, but while asleep, one is protected by the ear only. The importance of hearing is mentioned here in connection with attaining the highest perfection of life, namely getting free from three material pangs. Everyone is full of lamentation at every moment. Material life means constant lamentation and everyone is after the mirage of illusory things. The whole material creation is a creation of the illusory energy, and so many objects are there which bewilder the mind and people are simply running after this mirage. Mirage means something, a phenomenon or a death. In a desert, there is no water, but it appears like there is a body of water at a distance and one chases that body of water and never gets any water because there is no real water there in that mirage. Similarly in this material world, so many objects seem to be promising so much of happiness, but actually none of those objects can give us any real pleasure. And thirdly, he is always afraid of his supposed enemy, Shoka, Moha, Bhaya, these are three material pangs, which everyone in this material world who is born under the force of karma.\""

Everyone is affected by this disease in this material world and the primary symptoms, just like if somebody has got a viral infection, then they have a symptom called fever or some body pain, vomiting, loose motion, whatever, like that, what is the symptom of this material disease that is described as these three symptoms: Shoka, Moha, Bhaya. Shoka is lamentation, Moha is illusion and Bhaya is fear. And it is definitely suggested here in that simply by hearing the message of Srimad Bhagavatam, one gets attachment for the supreme personality. Krishna is very, very attractive, but you have to hear about Krishna from the pure devotee, because the pure devotee presents factually the actual personality of Godhead, not some speculated theory or some mental concoction, no, real Supreme Lord is presented by the pure devotee."

The process of Bhakti, Srila Vyasadeva saw the all perfect personality of Godhead and in this statement, the all perfect personality of Godhead Shri Krishna is clearly confirmed. The ultimate result of devotional service is to develop genuine love for the first Supreme personality. We have love for Krishna, but this is awakened only by this process of Bhakti. It cannot be awakened by the process of Jnana, Karma or Yoga. No material methods are possible to be practiced in order to awaken our genuine devotion or genuine love for Krishna. Love is a word which is often used in relation with man and woman. And love is the only word that can be properly used to indicate the relation between Lord"

Material energy is described as Apara Prakriti, living entities are described as Para Prakriti. So, we are Prakriti. Prakriti is feminine. The Lord is always described as the Parama Purusha, the supreme male personality. Thus, the affection between the Lord and the living entities is something like the affection between the male and the female in this material world. See why this is being said is because we have experienced what is the kind of affection that exists between a male and a female. So the term love of God, love of God is quite appropriate. If you understand from this perspective, we are feminine in terms of being Prakriti and the Lord is the supreme male. So the relationship is one of love."

      "transcript": "That is how Prabhupada explains in this purport. Loving devotional service to the Lord begins with hearing about the Lord. Shravanam. This process for executing devotional service is hearing. There is no difference between the Lord and the subject matter heard about him. This is the absolute nature of Krishna. His descriptions are identical with his personality. The Lord is absolute in all respects and thus there is no difference between him and the subject matter heard about him. Therefore, hearing about him means immediate contact with him. The Lord is an absolute in all respects and thus there is no difference between him and the subject matter heard about him, by the process of vibration of the transcendental sound, the sound which is emanating from the lips of the pure devotee. When the devotee, pure devotee describes the Supreme Lord Krishna, that sound is a transcendental vibration and the transcendental sound is so effective that it acts at once by removing all material affections mentioned above. Everything is completely cleansed away by the powerful sound of the description of the Supreme Lord. As mentioned before, a living entity develops a sort of complexity by material association and the illusory engagement of the material body is accepted as an actual fact. We are entangled in this world and we accept this illusion as something which is real. Why is it called illusion? Illusion means something which is not real you accept as real, something which is not fact you accept as fact and the actual fact is rejected as something which is not real. This is the whole basis of illusion."

      "transcript": "Under such false complexity, the living beings under different categories of life and become illusion in different ways. The way the illusory energy works is different for different living entities. Just like a dog, male dog is attracted to a female dog, a male pig is attracted to a female pig. Now from our perspective, the pig may be a very ugly creature or a filthy living in a filthy place in a gutter eating stool, abominable existence, but the evil energy of illusion is such that the soul in a male pig's body is attracted to the female pig's body simply to enjoy sex life, you see. Same thing happens even in bird society, animal society, even in human society also the same thing happens in the whole nature of the Universe by treating what is called happens. So Srila Prabhupada says, \"Even in the most developed stage of human life, the same illusion prevails in the form many isms and divides the loving relation between the Lord and the living entities, thereby it divides the loving relation between man and man, between one living, one human being, another human being, but by hearing the subject matter of Srimad Bhagavatam, this false complexity of materialism is removed and real peace in society begins which politicians aspire for so eagerly in many political situations.\" So peace is the prerequisite for love, there is no possibility of love without peace."
