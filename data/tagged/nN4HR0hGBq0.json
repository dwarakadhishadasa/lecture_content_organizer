      "transcript": "We spend our whole life trying to acquire material pleasures. We go to college, study very hard. Why? Because I want to get good marks. So we work hard, two years, three years, four years, doing our engineering or whatever, five years in case of doctors, study hard, write all the exams, day and night, burn the midnight oil and get good marks. Finally, at the end of it, we get a degree. And finally, when we come to the final year, we start preparing for the campus interviews. And then when you get a job, you start working hard. I should work in such a way that at the end of the year, my annual appraisals are good and I get either an increment or a promotion. But suddenly, when we read Prabhupada's books, what happened? All that passion we had for studying, getting good marks, getting a good job, what happened to all that? All simply vanished into thin air. No more you are interested. How? How? Because when we come in touch, we come in touch with the instructions of Prabhupada. Prabhupada is directly bestowing the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu upon us. In our heart, we lose all the consideration, all the attraction."
