      "transcript": "People generally go to temples and churches for mitigating some material wants. Even if you have material desires, still you take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa will fulfill your material desires and at the end will give shelter at His lotus feet. This is the advantage of devotion and service. Whereas if you worship other demigods, you may get some temporary benefit, but at the end the benefit will be finished, you will be finished, and the demigod who has given you the benediction, he will also be finished. But even if one has got some material desires to be fulfilled, if he worships Kṛṣṇa, those desires will be fulfilled. At the same time, he will get shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord."
