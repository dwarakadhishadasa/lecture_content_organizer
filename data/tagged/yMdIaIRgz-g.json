      "transcript": "Srila Prabhupada built up from scratch a worldwide organization in a relatively short span of 12 years, from 1965 to 1977. In fact, in 9 years, from 1968 to 1977, in Srila Prabhupada's own words. This was because from 1965 to 1968, not much progress was made in spreading ISKCON, especially with Srila Prabhupada's frail health in 1967. It was actually after 1968 that the movement really took off. In a lecture in 1971, Srila Prabhupada said, in this lecture given on 15th February 1971, \"So, practically we began work from 1968. 66 I started, but in 67 I became very much sick. So, I came back to India and again I went there in 1968. Practically this propaganda work began vigorously from 1968.\" During this time between 1965 to 1977, Srila Prabhupada wrote books prolifically while he guided his spiritually naive young disciples in the nuances of detail of community worship, Vaishnava culture, hygiene standards, personal attire and the like. Simultaneously, Srila Prabhupada stitched together the disparate but sincere attempts of his disciples into a coherent force resoundingly heard across countries. The world sat up and took notice, not because of the genius marketing strategies, masterminded by some devotee, but by the transcendental vision and potency of the pure devotee, Srila Prabhupada."

Srila Prabhupada was the expert conductor of this orchestra. Without Srila Prabhupada, it would have been nothing but cacophony. Everything was happening at a frenetic pace. Books were being published in an unending stream. Devotees were joining in droves, and temples were being opened in every nook and cranny of the world. The world was proving to be too small for the devotees. Unsurprisingly, although everything was expanding at a scorching pace between 1965 and 1977, nothing was haphazard or mindless. There was a method to the madness, and this was unsurprising given how Srila Prabhupada knew exactly what needed to be done, when and how in all matters. Srila Prabhupada was the sutradhara, the puppeteer, deftly coordinating the whole show into one smooth integrated growth in unison without any discord. Any slight deviations were dealt with swiftly and promptly, never allowing the organization to drift in any unwanted direction."

Although, such appointments appeared to be a result of random adjustments to address practical difficulties and challenges as they arose, in reality, those circumstances were only instrumental in the implementation of an already existing, well thought out system in Srila Prabhupada's vision for initiations in the moment, which could run for eternity. Srila Prabhupada as always knew precisely what he was doing and why, being the sharp transcendental visionary that he was. But this was not obvious to all, and hence, the GBC on the 28th of May 1977 decided to ask Srila Prabhupada how initiations would be conducted in ISKCON, particularly at the time when Srila Prabhupada was no longer with us."

      "transcript": "Since Srila Prabhupada had already been, over the years, putting in a system for this very purpose, he immediately responded without the need to mull over it. He would appoint some of his disciples as officiating Acharyas. That is, the disciples who would officiate on behalf of the Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, would be appointed soon. And not very much later, this appointment did come. It came on the 9th of July 1977. While Srila Prabhupada may have thoughtfully implemented the Rithvik system for all time in ISKCON, with deliberate purpose, it did raise many questions in the minds of the naysayers. Some of the questions are listed like this: The Rithvik system is against tradition. This is one argument. Another one, no other Acharya has ever done this. The third one, the law of disciplic succession is that one who is now the disciple becomes the Guru next. The fourth point, in the Rithvik system, there is no opportunity for Srila Prabhupada to reject a disciple if he wishes to. And another argument, Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya: One must approach a spiritual master, surrender to him, ask him questions, and serve him. In the Rithvik system, there is no opportunity for the disciple to ask the spiritual master questions or to receive instructions on his service. And many more arguments like this. It appears from these questions that the Rithvik system of initiations appears to violate the principles of Diksha or initiation. In this video, we will attempt to gain an overview of what constitutes initiation in order to get a better understanding of the Rithvik system of initiations. Once we do that, most questions will naturally get resolved once we have this overview properly. First of all,"

Srila Prabhupada, in his purport to verse number 331 of chapter 24 of the Madhya Leela of the Chaitanya Charitamrita, mentions, \"As far as Diksha is concerned, one should consult Madhya Leela, chapter 15, verse 108.\" And if we go to Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhya Leela, chapter 15, verse 108 purport, there Srila Prabhupada says, \"Srila Jeeva Goswami explains Diksha in his Bhakti Sandarbha, verse 283: divyam jnanam yato dadyat kuryat papasya sankshayam tasma dikshe tisa prokta desikais tattva kovidaihi. Diksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of the revealed scriptures knows this process as Diksha.\" So, essentially, as per the definition given by Srila Jeeva Goswami, Diksha or initiation constitutes two fundamental things: One is awakening transcendental knowledge and the second is vanquishing all sinful reactions. This is the real essence of Diksha or initiation."

The disciple serves the spiritual master by carrying out his instructions. 4. The disciple surrenders to the Diksha Guru. 5. A fire yajna is conducted to formalize the acceptance of the spiritual master by the disciple. 6. After the yajna, a new spiritual name is given to the disciple. 7. Sanctified beads are handed over to the disciple who vows to chant the prescribed number of rounds of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra on those beads. All previous karmic reactions of the disciple are destroyed. This is point number 8. And point number 9: Transcendental knowledge is revealed in the heart of the disciple by the Diksha Guru. Number 10: The Diksha Guru takes responsibility to take the disciple back to Godhead. So, these are some of the commonly understood components of initiation or Diksha."

Diksha Guru clears the spiritual doubts and corrects the disciple's mistakes. These activities require a physically present person to instruct, to correct, to clear specific doubts, etc. Hence, we have included them under the physical or personal aspect. Now, under the second column of ceremonial aspects are listed the activities of formal surrender by the disciple to the Diksha Guru, formal acceptance by the Diksha Guru of the disciple, initiation yajna, Diksha yajna, initiation sacrifice, sanctified beads being handed over to the disciple, and new spiritual name being selected for the disciple. These are generally related to the initiation ceremony or the Diksha ceremony. Therefore, we have called this the ceremonial aspects of Diksha. Under the third column of transcendental aspects are listed the activities of disciple accepting the Diksha Guru in his heart and vice versa, the Guru accepting the disciple. Then the Guru reveals transcendental knowledge in the heart of the disciple. Then the Diksha Guru destroys previous karma of the disciple and the Diksha Guru takes the disciple back to Godhead."

      "transcript": "Now, let us go through a few quotes of Srila Prabhupada on the matter of the components listed under the physical or personal aspects column. Here is what Srila Prabhupada said on this matter on various occasions. \"Similarly, the GBC member means they will see that in every temple, these books are very thoroughly being read and discussed and understood and applied in practical life. The GBC can supervise the things that are going on. The first management is that each and every member in the temple is chanting extremely long things and following the regulations. The representative of all five members must see that the members are chanting. So all GBC members must see that in every temple everyone is engaged. So the purpose of having in the society is to show the devotees how they can always be in 24 hours engaged according to your... Yes, that is helping one another. If I am deficient, by seeing your example, I shall correct myself. This is the idea. Not that a fool's paradise. All fools join together. Not like that. There should be ideal life. At least the leaders, the president, the GBC, they will show the example and they will follow.\" Srila Prabhupada, there is also a question of reciprocation. You have so many disciples, thousands. And one devotee was asking me yesterday, I want to please Srila Prabhupada. How does he know my progress and my service when I am so far away from him and if I don't write him? So there is a representative there, the president, the GBC. They will see. The representative may be there, but what is my personal relationship? To obey your spiritual master. Whatever he has said, you follow strictly. Follow the regulative principle, chant sixteen now. That's all. What happens when that inevitable time comes when a successor is needed? He is asking about the future. Who will guide the movement in the future? They will guide. I am training them. Will there be one spiritual leader though? I am training GBC 18 all over the world. His personal secretaries. I see. To see that the original teachings that Prabhupada has given are not in any way changed. In addition to whatever you just heard, in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Adi Leela, chapter 1, verse 35 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, \"A devotee must have only one initiating spiritual master, because in the scriptures, acceptance of more than one is always forbidden. There is no limit, however, to the number of instructing spiritual masters one may accept. Generally, a spiritual master who constantly instructs a disciple in spiritual science becomes his initiating spiritual master later on.\""

The temple presidents and the GBCs are supposed to be Siksha Gurus taking care of correcting, clearing doubts and assigning services to the devotees. Srila Prabhupada through his books delivers spiritual instructions to the disciples which we have classified as revealing transcendental knowledge within the heart under the column transcendental aspects. But if any devotee is in doubt after reading Srila Prabhupada's books, what does he do? Whom does he go to clear his doubts? Those doubts are to be cleared by the temple president and the GBC which falls under the first column which is called the physical or personal aspects. But of course, this does not limit Prabhupada. In many cases, some devotee has some doubt. He just opens some book of Prabhupada and starts reading or hears some lecture. Prabhupada can directly also clear those doubts. Thus, it is evident that Srila Prabhupada delegated the aspect of the initiation process or Diksha which requires physical or personal presence. Srila Prabhupada delegated that to the temple presidents and the GBCs or the senior devotees in the movement."

You have the threads chanted on by me and now I am enclosing here with copies of Gayathri Mantra, one for each of the seven disciples to be initiated. Hold a fire ceremony. Chant Gayathri Mantra to them individually, and let them hear and repeat. Then offer the threads on my behalf. The fire sacrifice should be performed as usual.\" Here, Srila Prabhupada authorized the temple president to chant the Gayathri Mantra into the ear of the devotee being initiated. In another letter to Nithyananda written on 29th of September 1972, Srila Prabhupada said something similar to what he wrote in his 1970 letter which we saw just now. So, in 1972 also, in this letter to Nithyananda, Srila Prabhupada said, \"Now hold the ceremony as per the enclosed instructions. During the fire ceremony, you can also give the sacred thread and Gayathri Mantra to Bhudhara, which I am enclosing also here with. Teach him to chant on the finger divisions and play the copy of the tape of me reciting Gayathri Mantra into his right ear. Also, I am sending the beads for Michael Lightfoot duly chanted by me under separate post. So, you may hold the fire yajna, install DTs and give initiation to these two boys.\" In this letter, Srila Prabhupada said a recorded tape of his could be used for Gayathri initiation."

In Europe, Revatinandan Swami will chant on the new devotees beads on my behalf, because it is such long distance, therefore it is very expensive to send beads air mail from here. And there are so many instances of the beads being lost in that way. And I am getting now requests up to 20 or 30 each week. So, it is practically becoming impossible for me to chant the beads when I am so far distant. Therefore, the new devotees may send their beads to Kirtananda in New Vrindavan and he will chant the beads and send back to them. Is this all right? Now hold the fire Ejna and give also second initiation to Sarva Darshan, Ejnapati and Hari Vallabh. Enclosed, please find three sacred threads duly chanted by me along with three copies of Gayathri Mantra. Now hold the fire Ejna for all nine devotees and for the second initiates, teach them how to chant on the finger divisions and play for them the tape of me reciting Gayathri Mantra into their right ear.\" So, here we can see that Srila Prabhupada authorized senior devotees to chant on the beads and the temple president to conduct the Ejna to hand over the beads and announce the spiritual name of the devotee being initiated."

And now I am receiving weekly not less than 10 to 15 such requests from new students. So, it is becoming very expensive to send so many sets of beads such long distance, and it has become little bothersome for me also. So, I think now you may be appointed by me to give first initiations to new disciples by chanting on their beads on my behalf. In America, Kirtananda Swami is doing that. So, now if there are two of you, that will give me great relief. Kirtananda will chant on the beads for new devotees in America, Canada, like that. You can chant on the beads for the European continent new disciples. They shall, of course, still be considered as my disciples, not that they shall become your disciples, but you will be empowered by me to chant their beads, and that is the same effect of binding master and disciple as if I were personally chanting.\" So, the senior devotees who are acting as Rithwiks were empowered by Srila Prabhupada to chant on the beads, thus, binding Srila Prabhupada as the Diksha Guru or spiritual master to the disciple."

      "transcript": "Now, it is clear that Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspects of the process of Diksha or initiation, the Diksha Vidhana to the senior devotees. And on July 9th, Srila Prabhupada delegated the choosing of names also to the Rithwiks. Now, let us look at a few more quotes of Srila Prabhupada with respect to the last column, the transcendental aspects column. In a letter to Tamal Krishna written on 19th of August 1968, Srila Prabhupada wrote, \"The chanting Hare Krishna is our main business. That is real initiation. And as you are all following my instruction, in that matter, the initiator is already there. Now, the next initiation will be performed as a ceremony officially. Of course, that ceremony has value because the name, holy name will be delivered to the student from the disciplic succession. It has got value. But in spite of that, as you are going on chanting, please go on with this business sincerely, and Krishna willing, I may be coming to you very soon.\" In another letter to Jadurani written on 4th of September 1972, Srila Prabhupada wrote, \"The eternal bond between disciples and spiritual master begins from the first day he hears. Just like my spiritual master, in 1922, he said in our first meeting, 'You are educated boys. Why don't you preach this cult?' That was the beginning. Now, it is coming to fact. Therefore, the relationship began from that day.\" From these quotes of Srila Prabhupada, we can see how Srila Prabhupada placed more emphasis on the transcendental aspects rather than on the ceremonial aspects or the personal or physical aspects of the process of initiation to act."

      "transcript": "As Srila Prabhupada says, the ceremony has its place and importance, but without the transcendental aspects, the ceremonial aspects will not bear fruit. Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspect of initiation to the rithwiks, namely, chanting on the beads, selecting the spiritual names, etc. And he delegated to the temple presidents the conducting of the fire yajna, handing over the beads and announcing the name. So like this, Srila Prabhupada delegated the ceremonial aspects to the rithwiks and to the temple presidents. And Srila Prabhupada started delegating this aspect to the temple presidents and GBCs from as early as 1970. Finally, when Srila Prabhupada had personally overseen the successful implementation of this delegation of the ceremonial aspects as well as the personal or physical aspects over the next seven years from 1970 till 1977, Srila Prabhupada gave it a solid stamp of finality via the directive on July 9th, 1977. Now what Srila Prabhupada did not delegate to his representatives, the temple presidents, the GBCs and the rithwiks is the transcendental aspect of initiation. Let us look at a few more quotes of Srila Prabhupada. In the purport to the Chaitanya Charitamrita Madhyalila, Chapter 15, verse number 108, purport, Srila Prabhupada says, \"Srila Jeeva Goswami explains deeksha in his Bhaktisandharbha, verse 283, divyam jnanam yathodadhyat kuryat papasya sankshayam tasma deeksheti saa prokta deshikai statva kovidaihi. Deeksha is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of the revealed scriptures knows this process as deeksha.\""

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/yMdIaIRgz-g?t=1830",
      "transcript": "Further, in the same purport, Srila Prabhupada says, \"It is Srimad Bhagavatam's opinion that the process of Deity worship is not actually necessary. Just as the specific prescriptions of the Pancharatra and other scriptures do not have to be followed, the Bhagavatam enjoins that even without practising Deity worship, one can achieve the complete success of human life by any of the other devotional processes, such as simply offering oneself at the Lord's feet for His protection. Nonetheless, Vaishnavas following the path of Sri Narada and his successors endeavour to establish a personal relationship with the Lord by receiving the grace of a bona fide spiritual master through initiation, and in this tradition, the devotees are obliged at the time of initiation to begin engaging in Deity worship. Although Deity worship is not essential, the material conditioning of most candidates for devotional service requires that they engage in this activity. When we consider their bodily and mental conditions, we find that the character of such candidates is impure and their minds are agitated. Therefore, to rectify this material conditioning, the great sage Narada and others have at different times recommended various kinds of regulations for Deity worship.\" As we can see, the transcendental aspect of initiation consists of destroying the sins of the disciple, awakening the transcendental knowledge in the heart, and taking the disciple back to Godhead, which are actually the crux or the heart or the essence of initiation or Diksha."

      "summary": "This segment emphasizes that the transcendental aspects of initiation cannot be delegated and must be performed directly by an Uttama Adhikari, explaining how the Rittvik system allows Srila Prabhupada to retain these aspects.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/yMdIaIRgz-g?t=1970",
      "transcript": "And these aspects cannot be delegated. They have to be performed only by an Uttama Adhikari or Mahabhagavata spiritual master Diksha Guru directly. So, the final table of the different aspects of initiation looks like this. Take a look at this. The first column, physical or personal aspects, were delegated to temple presidents, GBCs, and senior devotees. The second column, ceremonial aspects, were delegated to the rittviks and to the temple presidents. And the third column, transcendental aspects, were retained by Srila Prabhupada. The other aspects of physical or personal presence and ceremony may be even done away with completely, as we can see how Srila Narada Muni initiated Murugari or Dhruva Maharaj. But the transcendental aspects cannot be done away with. Hence, Srila Prabhupada via the rittvik system delegated the two aspects of initiation which are not mandatorily to be performed by an Uttama Adhikari: The physical or personal aspects and the ceremonial aspects. Both of these can be done by devotees who may not be on that Uttama Adhikari platform. At the same time, Srila Prabhupada continues to retain the transcendental aspect of initiation, and thus, he continues to rule the hearts of those who become devotees of Krishna by reading his books and becoming attached to his temples. So, you can see from this table that these arguments like rittvik system is not valid because there is no guru to instruct on service, according to tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya words, does not hold good because that's a personal or physical aspect which may not be essential. Then, there is no guru to clear your doubts. Even that is not applicable in the rittvik system. And there is nobody to correct the devotees, the disciples' mistakes. Even that doesn't hold good. So, all the arguments which are brought up against the rittvik system is centered around the personal or physical aspect which has been already addressed in the rittvik system of initiations. Prabhupada has already addressed it. So, using those arguments, you cannot invalidate the rittvik system of initiations because if you see the entire system of giving deeksha, the personal or physical aspect and the ceremonial aspect are only one portion of the entire deeksha vidhana, the process of deeksha, and they are not the most important part of deeksha. The most important part of deeksha is the transcendental aspect which Prabhupada is doing, he is continuing to do, which he was doing before 1977 and even now also he is continuing to do without the necessity of his personal physical presence."

There were so many devotees in ISKCON who got initiated who might never have met Srila Prabhupada but all the transcendental aspects were fully fulfilled. So therefore, these kind of arguments which are focusing on the personal or physical aspect to say that a living guru is essential is looking at the whole process of deeksha in a very narrow frame and therefore we should not get caught up by these kind of arguments which are not having a proper overview of the entire initiation process. Thus we can see clearly that there is nothing against tradition or any law of disciplic succession. None of these things are being violated by the Rithvik system instituted in ISKCON by Srila Prabhupada personally particularly for the time when Srila Prabhupada is no longer with us."

Any other system developed by persons who are not similarly enlightened is fraught with dangers and pitfalls. Like Srila Prabhupada often quoted Prahlada Maharaj who said that blind people following blind leaders are bound to end up in a ditch. The ISKCON Mumbai Group's GBC has invented a system of a managerial board indicating no objection to Diksha Gurus in ISKCON. There is absolutely no evidence to support this invention of no-objection gurus. There is no evidence either by way of tradition or parampara or shastra or Srila Prabhupada's direct order. And by their own admission in their resolution number 409 of 2004 they don't know if anybody in ISKCON is a pure devotee or not. Any system like this no-objection guru system in ISKCON which has been invented by such conditioned souls is definitely pervaded by the defects of cheating, errors, illusions and imperfections. Hence, the Rithvik system of initiations ordered by Srila Prabhupada the pure devotee in ISKCON who is beyond all the four defects which plague the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai is the safest path for those whose goal in life is to go back to Godhead."

Every tradition has a beginning somewhere. The beginning will be some Acharya or the other. Acharyas have the authority and the power to start new traditions. The question that Rithvik system has never been followed in any tradition presumptuously assumes that Srila Prabhupada is not empowered he is not authorized he is not powerful enough to start new traditions. But the GBC thinks that they are better than Srila Prabhupada. Why? Because they can start a new tradition of a managerial board like the GBC indicating no objection to Diksha Gurus. But Srila Prabhupada is not powerful enough to start a new tradition of a Rithvik system of initiations. This kind of attitude of the GBC towards Srila Prabhupada is very offensive, and this question of asking about tradition to support the Rithvik system of initiations ordered by Srila Prabhupada is actually very disrespectful towards Srila Prabhupada. Hence instead of asking Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group devotees in which tradition is the Rithvik system of initiations practiced the devotees of the ISKCON Mumbai group should be questioning their GBC about their resolution number 409 of 2004 which states that when the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating it does not thereby endorse him as an Uttam Adhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. Rather the GBC indicates that it has no objection to saying that the devotees of the ISKCON Mumbai group should please ask their GBC in which tradition is it found that a GBC body indicates no objection to allow devotees to act as a Diksha Guru. Also please ask them why they are not obeying Srila Prabhupada's order on July 9, 1977 to conduct initiations in the ISKCON Mumbai group. The devotees of the ISKCON Mumbai group should conduct initiations in ISKCON via Ritviks. That is the real question to be asked. Instead of following the offensive no objection Guru system of the ISKCON Mumbai group please follow Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON group's system of Srila Prabhupada's July 9th directive to implement Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON and remain free from offences to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada. Hare Krishna Vishwaguru Srila Prabhupada"
