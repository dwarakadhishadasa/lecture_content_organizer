In this session, we will be discussing from a new chapter, the 7th chapter of the first canto of Bhagavatam. The 7th chapter is entitled, The Son of Drona Punished. And we will be beginning with the first verse: SHAUNAKA VACHA NIRGATE NARADE SUTA BHHAGAVAN BHADARAYANAH SHRUTAVAM STAD ABHIPRETAM TATAKHIM AKAROD VIBHUHU. The meaning of this verse is, Rishi Shaunaka asked, O Suta! The great and transcendentally powerful Vyasa Deva heard everything from Shri Narada Muni. So after Narada's departure, what did Vyasa Deva do? If you remember, the conversation between the sages of Naimisharanya headed by Shaunaka Rishi and Suta Goswami is the beginning of the first chapter of the first canto of Bhagavatam, the opening of the Bhagavatam. So, seeing the eagerness of these sages to hear about Krishna, Suta Goswami decided to recite the Bhagavatam, which he had heard from Shukadeva Goswami. So before reciting the Bhagavatam, Shaunaka Rishi asked many other questions apart from the first six questions to Suta Goswami. So, in response to questions asked by Shaunaka Rishi, who is the representative of the sages of Naimisharanya, Suta Goswami is answering. Here, Shaunaka Rishi is asking to continue, what did Vyasa Deva do? After he heard everything about Narada Muni's previous birth, how Narada Muni actually got enlightenment from the Bhaktivedanta centers, how Narada Muni actually got enlightenment from the Bhaktivedanta... How Narada Muni actually got enlightenment from the Bhaktivedanta... How he practiced going to a sacred place, the meditation on the Supreme Lord, how he had a brief glimpse of the darshan of the Lord, then the Lord spoke to him, and then he became perfect, and when he quit his body in his previous life, he changed from a material body to a completely spiritual body, and in that spiritual body now, in this day of Brahma, he is born as the son of Brahma, in his same transcendental form, and he travels everywhere simply singing the glories of the Supreme Lord, while vibrating on his transcendental instrument, the Veena, which is given to him by Krishna himself, and in this way, he is himself completely enlivened, and he enlivens others also."

So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, in this chapter, the clue for describing Srimad Bhagavatam is picked up, as Maharaj Pariksit is miraculously saved in the womb of his mother. Now, Bhagavatam begins from the point where the end of the battle of Kurukshetra, Pariksit, see the central personalities for the recitation of the Bhagavatam, first time, is Pariksit Maharaj, who inquired from Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami learned the Bhagavatam from Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva compiled the Bhagavatam after hearing about Narada's instructions on Bhagavatam. So, that is the link. Now, the narration will begin by Suta Goswami about the Bhagavatam, how Pariksit was saved in the womb of his mother, and that is the description of the birth and activities of Pariksit Maharaj, which was inquired to Suta Goswami. Now, this reason for Pariksit being saved in the womb of his mother was because the cause was Ashwatthama, the son of Dronacharya, who killed the five sons of Draupadi while they were asleep, for which he was punished by Arjuna. That is the incident that is going to be narrated. In this chapter, in the seventh chapter, the son of Drona punished. By whom? By Arjuna. Because the son of Drona, Ashwatthama, he killed the five sleeping sons of Draupadi towards the end of the Battle of Kurukshetra."

Following Narada Muni's instructions to compile Bhagavatam, he realized the entire truth about Krishna, which is going to be described by Vyasa Deva while compiling the Bhagavatam, and Vyasa Deva is going to teach it to his own son, Shukadeva Goswami, who is already a liberated soul. So, we will hear now systematically about Vyasa Deva realizing the truth. So, we will hear now systematically about Vyasa Deva realizing the truth. The second verse.

The western bank of the Saraswati river is especially suitable for this purpose, and there is the ashram of Vyasa Deva at Shamyaprasa.

So that place, that is the place where Vyasa Deva's ashram is located, and Vyasa Deva sat there and engaged in meditation, and when he was and had reached Samadhi, he was able to actually realize the entire truth about the absolute personality of Godhead Krishna that will be described now. Now, Srila Vyasa Deva was a householder, that's how he had a son Sukhdev Goswami, yet his residential place is called an ashram. So what is ashram? An ashram is a place where spiritual culture is always foremost. Ashram is a residential place, but it is a spiritually surcharged place because it is the most suitable place for such a spiritual place, but it is a place where you are... spiritual shelter for any transcendentalist. It is necessary to reside in a place where spiritual culture is foremost. That means a transcendentalist does not live in any place simply for engaging in some sense enjoyment. A transcendentalist voluntarily gives up sense enjoyment in order to cultivate spiritual life."

      "transcript": "So Vyasa Deva, of course, is perfect because he is the empowered incarnation of the Supreme Lord for compiling all the Vedic literature, and he has appeared for this purpose specifically. He says also an incarnation of the Lord, Shakya Vesha Avatar, so he has no need to practice, but nonetheless, to set an example, he is situated in his ashram, and he is performing meditation in order to fix his mind on the absolute personality of Godhead, the absolute truth, and realize the whole subject matter of the Bhagavad Gita before compiling. Srila Prabhupada further explains, it does not matter whether the place belongs to a householder or a mendicant. Mendicant means somebody who is a renunciant, who is a tapasvi, who is a renounced order of life. The whole varnashrama system is so designed that each and every status of life is called an ashram. Varana ashrama, four varanas: brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra. This defines the whole system of life. This defines the occupational duty of four different classes of people in the civilized human society. Apart from these four varanas, there are four ashramas. What are the four ashramas? brahmachari ashram, grihastha ashram, vanaprastha ashram, sannyas ashram. These are four stages of gradual progress towards the ultimate goal of self realization while spiritual culture is very prominent."
