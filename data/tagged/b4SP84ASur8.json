I have fortunately been instructed by you and thus great favor has been bestowed upon me. I thank God that I have listened with open ears to your pure words. Srila Rupa Goswami has given directions in his Bhakti Rasamita Sindhu on how to accept a bona fide spiritual master and how to deal with him. First, the desiring candidate must find a bona fide spiritual master and then he must very eagerly receive instructions from him and execute them. This is reciprocal service. A bona fide spiritual master or saintly person always desires to elevate a common man who comes to him because everyone is under the delusion. Because everyone is under the delusion of Maya and is forgetful of his prime duty, Krishna Consciousness, a saintly person always desires that everyone become a saintly person."

      "transcript": "It is the function of a saintly person to invoke Krishna Consciousness in every forgetful common man. Manu said that since he was advised and instructed by Kardamma Muni, he was very much favoured. He considered himself lucky to receive the message by oral reception. It is especially mentioned here that one should be very inquisitive to hear with open ears from the authorized source of the bona fide spiritual master. How is one to receive? One should receive the transcendental message by oral reception. The word, Karnarandhraja, means through the holes of the ears. The favour of the spiritual master is not received through any other part of the body but the ears. This does not mean, however, that the spiritual master gives a particular type of mantra through the ears in exchange for some dollars and if the man meditates on that, he achieves perfection and becomes God within six months. Such reception through the ears is bogus. The real fact is that the bona fide spiritual master knows the nature of a particular man and what sort of duties he can perform in Krishna Consciousness and he instructs him in that way. He instructs him through the ear not privately but publicly, you are fit for such and such work in Krishna Consciousness, you can act in this way. One person is advised to act in Krishna Consciousness by working in the deity's room. Another is advised to act in Krishna Consciousness by performing editorial work. Another is advised to do preaching work. And another is advised to carry out Krishna Consciousness in the cooking department. There are different departments of activity in Krishna Consciousness and a spiritual master, knowing the particular ability of a particular man, trains him in such a way that by his tendency to act, he becomes perfect. Bhagavad Gita makes it clear that one can attain the highest perfection of spiritual life simply by offering service according to his ability, just as Arjuna served Krishna by his ability in the military art."

One has to receive the message of the spiritual master in order to be perfect. spiritual master regarding one's capacity for the spiritual master is expert in giving such instructions. This combination, the instruction of the spiritual master and the faithful execution of the instruction by the disciple makes the entire process perfect. Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur describes in his explanation of the verse in Bhagavad Gita, that one who wants to be certain to achieve spiritual success must take the instruction from the spiritual master as to what his particular function is. He should faithfully try to execute that particular instruction and should consider that his life and soul. The faithful execution of the instruction by the disciple is the best way to achieve spiritual success. The faithful execution of the instruction which he receives from the spiritual master is the only duty of a disciple and that will bring him perfection. One should be very careful to receive the message from the spiritual master through the ears and execute it faithfully. That will make"

The material intellect is like a shutter. It opens that shutter. This material intellect, a shutter always stops light, isn't it? In a camera, a shutter stops light. As far as spiritual bhakti is concerned, when you compare it with the process of receiving transcendental words from the spiritual master, receiving transcendental sound, the material speculative intelligence is like a shutter. It has to be opened up. What does that mean? First, one should have faith that the shabda, that the words that emanate from a pure devotee, has God, the knowledge is God, is contained within that. The intelligence to understand those words are also contained within that. You only have to receive transcendental intelligence. Your material intelligence gets purified by transcendental intelligence. Material intelligence cannot lead us to transcendental intelligence."

The moment the intellectual shatter, you take Bhagavad Gita as it is, go on reading, parpatu parpatu, go on reading. I used to do this, first when I got Bhagavad Gita. It was so nice.

Sometimes we are all very overconfident about our material intelligence, our rational intelligence. It is very limited. It is a very limited chapter. It is a way of growth. It is a starting way of growth of spiritual life. Because we are stuck in our intelligence, we have to purify our intelligence. We have to try to understand with our material logic, material intelligence, we have to try to understand. But you should understand further stages. You should understand that there is another way of simple repeated oral reception. This shabda has got, it's not, this shabda does not only have intellectual energy. It has got the ability to understand. This shabda has got the ability to speak. It has got the ability to understand. There is little energy there.

I pray to Srila Prabhupada that I get the right kind of instruction from my. From the system. Here. Mystically operates. And once you take gets the instruction then you think he understands that this is Prabhupada's instruction to me. This is a duty assigned to me. I should execute it meticulously. Seriously.

There are some duty. It is a duty of certain people to give instruction to people who are below. It is a duty. So while doing that duty that will be. That will be. When he is chanting 16 rounds.

That is why see the temple president is the one who recommends somebody for initiation. And the temple president is a spiritual authority for them also. They just go flying around after initiation, they won't advance. They have to associate with the temple. They have to take guidance from the temple. That is very important.

Duty cannot be neglected. The person has to be corrected means he has to be corrected. Somebody has to do the job. So, then you should think this is Prabhupada's test. This is a test that Prabhupada has given me. I should build up my internal thing that I am, while doing this service of telling another Jeeva something, criticizing, I cannot be enjoying that. It is a service to that devotee. So, I have to build up that service mode. I cannot be impulsive. So, duty also has to be done. You need not wait for it. Escalation is there.

Everything, every time in management, soft thing doesn't work. Right? The person will be completely in Maya. What is the use of showing spiritual humility before him? He will go more into Maya. So, you have to go according to that devotee's consciousness. You have to become very heavy also. So, with great difficulty you should become heavy, not enjoy becoming heavy. I don't know that. This is a very, very, for a Vaishnava, this is a very unpalatable job. To criticize a devotee, to get heavy on a devotee, it's not an enjoyable thing. But it has to be done.
