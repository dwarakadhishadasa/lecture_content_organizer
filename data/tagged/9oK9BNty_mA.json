A spiritual master is liberating me from this. You do any kind of gratitude, it is not enough. You do any kind of glorification of spiritual master, that is still not enough for what he has done to you. What he has done is to liberate us from this material energy."

But tomorrow, if you don't chant, you will get bonded. You can call it as a day-to-day liberation program we have. Day-to-day liberated we are."

Then how I am living? How my body is functioning? My karma is not acting upon me. No, there are sluice gates in the dam. In the dam, in a controlled manner, water is sent out."

How much water should come out? That is doubt-tailing. They guide you how to doubt-tail your entire attachments and everything, how to doubt-tail it. So there is a control. That way, we are liberated."

Build back the dam again, immediately. Give you some more realization, give you some more knowledge, and try to, again and again, increase your transcendental knowledge. Try to detach you, person to person, situation to situation, Paramatmas, the Supersoul is actually trying to enlighten the living entity, but if you go on like that, then one day the dam will be open. Okay, become a karma. You don't want this. You don't, you don't, you don't deserve to be liberated. So it's a liberated life. So whatever we do, that constant downpour of water from the cloud, the cloud is compared to the mercy of the spiritual master, where the grace of the spiritual master, the cloud of mercy of the Personality of Godhead is brought in, then only when the rains of Krishna consciousness fall, the rain of..."
