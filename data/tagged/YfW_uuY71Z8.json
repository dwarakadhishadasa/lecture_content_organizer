The meaning of this verse is: Lord Shri Krishna then prepared for his departure. He invited the sons of Pandu after having been worshipped by the brahmanas headed by Srila Vyasadeva. The Lord also reciprocated greetings."

      "transcript": "We should understand the historical incidents in the proper context that Krishna came from Dwaraka in order to conduct the battle of Kurukshetra, and after the battle of Kurukshetra, Yudhishthira was enthroned as the Emperor, and Krishna, having completed his mission in visiting Hastinapura, is now preparing for his departure to go to Kurukshetra in order to return to Dwaraka. That is being described here, that Krishna prepared for his departure, and when he was leaving Hastinapura, the Brahmanas headed by Srila Vyasadeva worshiped Krishna. So, that is explained by Srila Prabhupada in the purport. Apparently, Lord Sri Krishna was a Kshatriya and was not worshipable by the Brahmanas. The convention is Kshatriyas should worship Brahmanas. That is the Varanashrama division of the society, members of the society. But the Brahmanas present there in Hastinapura, headed by Srila Vyasa Deva, all knew him, that is, knew Krishna, to be the personality of Godhead, and therefore they worshipped him. So, they were not wrong in worshipping a Kshatriya. The Brahmanas were not wrong because even though Krishna was playing the part of a Kshatriya, Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead under all circumstances, at all times, in all places."

      "transcript": "In the material world, everybody's position is a temporary, changeable position. Krishna's position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally a fact, no matter what activities are performed by Krishna. Krishna may perform the role of the chariot driver of Arjuna, but that does not make Krishna come down to a lower position. No, he does not come down in his position. His position remains the same, absolute, always the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That's how, even though he is seated on the chariot of Arjuna as the chariot driver, Sarathi, but still when Arjuna was perplexed, Krishna instructed Arjuna, and through Arjuna, the entire human society in the subject matter of Bhagavad Gita. So when he is speaking as Bhagavad Gita, he is speaking as the Supreme Lord. In fact, his actions, all his actions are performed in his original position only. He does not lose his position even though he may assume a subordinate position. He may assume an unequal position, but his position is unchanged."

The Lord reciprocated the greetings just to honour the social order that a Kshatriya is obedient to the orders of the Brahmanas. Now, when the Brahmanas offer something to Krishna, Krishna reciprocates properly, receiving it, just to honour the social custom. Hmm. That a Kshatriya is obedient to the orders of the Brahmanas. That is social custom. Although Lord Sri Krishna was always offered the respects due the Supreme Lord from all responsible quarters, the Lord never deviated from the customary usages between the four orders of society."

      "transcript": "In the fourth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, chaaturvarnyam maya-srishtam guna-karma-vibhaga-saha. He says, it is I who have created these four divisions of social orders in human society: chaaturvarnyam brahmana-kshatriya-vaisa-shudra. Society can be perfectly organised in that way: the intellectuals, the administrators, the business class, the productive class, that is the business class, and the labourers. And different people have different skills, different qualities. They are born under different influences of the gunas. Accordingly, they can be engaged properly in some livelihood, means of livelihood. But everybody is entitled, eligible for ultimate liberation in the human form of life. And that's what the whole varnashrama dharma is about: how to worship Vishnu by performance of your duty in such a way that you will actually be ultimately liberated from material bondage."

Then, in the next verse, the eighth verse, it is said here, gantum krta matir brahman tvarakam ratam asthitah upalebe abhi dhavantim uttaram bhaya vikvalam. The meaning of this verse is, as soon as he seated himself on the chariot to start for Dwaraka, Krishna has seated himself. He has made preparations for his departure and he is seated on the chariot. He saw Uttara hurrying towards him in fear."

      "transcript": "Uttara is the wife of Abhimanyu, the daughter-in-law of Arjuna and Subhadra, whose son is Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu was killed in the battle of Kurukshetra. So, Uttara had lost her husband in the battle. So, she was hurrying towards Krishna in fear. Now, Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, all the members of the family of the Pandavas were completely dependent on the protection of the Lord. Why? Because they are all pure devotees of the Lord. All the members of the family of the Pandavas, all of them are pure devotees of the Lord. And the symptom or characteristic of a pure devotee is complete dependence, dependence on the protection of the Lord. In fact, for anyone, there is no other protection outside the protection of Krishna. That's a fact. That's true for everybody, not just for the pure devotees. But, pure devotees know this fact and they always seek shelter of Krishna's lotus feet, Krishna's protection. Because the members of the family of the Pandavas are completely dependent on protection of the Supreme Lord, therefore, the Lord protected all of them in all circumstances. It is reciprocal. The Lord protects everyone, but one who depends completely upon him is especially looked after by the Lord. The father is more attentive to the little son who is exclusively dependent on the father. The example is being given by Srila Prabhupada. The father has many children. The grown up ones may not require as much care and attention and protection as much as the little one. So, the little son who is exclusively dependent on the father, the father is more attentive. Similarly, the pure devotees who are especially completely dependent upon him, the Lord is more attentive."

The meaning is that Uttara said, O Lord of Lords, Lord of the Universe, You are the greatest of mystics. Please protect me for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death in this world of duality. There is no one who can save me in this world of duality from the clutches of death. This world is called Mrtyuloka, a place where death is certain for everyone who takes birth. Krishna describes in the Bhagavad Gita, jatasyahi dhruva-mrtyur dhruvam janma-mrtyasya ca. For anyone who has taken birth in the material world, death is certain. That means this body, life in this body is going to come to an end. It is not going to be there forever. The soul is eternal, but the life in this body is not eternal. So that time comes when we have to quit the body, that is called death. So in this world of death, who can save anyone except Krishna? Nobody else can save. So therefore, Uttara is telling, please protect me for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death. So therefore, the response of the Lord also will be described and before that Uttara's prayer is not complete. Why is she asking for protection? That will be explained in the next verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much."
