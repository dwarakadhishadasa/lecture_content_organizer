      "transcript": "Some time back, one devotee asked me, what if a devotee becomes proud of pridelessness? Yes, it happens. It can happen. We can become proud of many other virtues that a devotee is supposed to have. But, our method of developing all these qualities is not by trying to acquire those qualities separately. We first become devotees of Krishna. To become genuine devotees of Krishna, we have to come to a spiritual platform. Our principle is, in such a person's heart, all divine qualities will come about. If we make an attempt to become prideless on a mental plane, there is a chance that we will become proud of pridelessness. But our attempt is to come to a spiritual platform. And when one comes to a genuine, spiritual platform,"
