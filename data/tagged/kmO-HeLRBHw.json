      "transcript": "Interesting question. How do we not overthink or overanalyze? How to avoid overthinking and overanalyzing? Well, if we look at the Vedic scriptures, if we look at the Bhagavad Gita, faith is given a very important role to play in acquisition of knowledge. Now of course, in the modern day, faith is given a very, you know, it is treated as a very contemptuous thing. All religions are all fakes. Leave it aside. Science is real knowledge. That's the way it is presented. It is true that to acquire spiritual knowledge, you need faith. Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita that ashraddha dana, those who are unfaithful, those who do not have faith, they will have neither peace in this life nor in the next one. So to be able to acquire spiritual knowledge, faith is very important. But then to acquire science also faith is required. All of us, we learn science. How? By going to the school and college, sitting in a classroom and studying the textbook. Whatever the textbook is teaching, we accept it as truth. We say to water, consciousness, there are two molecules of water. All of us have done it. How many of you have actually taken out water and analyzed how many atoms of hydrogen, how many atoms of oxygen are there? How many of you have done it? None of us have done it. True, no? But if anybody asks any one of us, what is the composition of water? What is the chemical composition of water? H2O. Immediately answer will come. Where did you get this H2O from? What is hydrogen in the first place? What is oxygen? Oxygen, can you separate it out and show it to me? If you can you show it to me, where is oxygen? Show me. Can you show me? Not possible. Can you show me hydrogen? Not possible. Can you show me God? Not possible. So can you show me God? I cannot show you God because you cannot see. So God does not exist. You cannot show me hydrogen, how should I accept that hydrogen exists? You are telling periodic table you are showing and all those things. Very fine. All right. That table anybody can make. Even a child can sit and make. So just because you made it and you put it in the textbook, I have to accept. So when you teach from a book, we have to accept it blindly. I have faith. This is a science book. Accept it. That's all. When it comes to same Bhagavad Gita, that is also a book. No, no, no, it is faith. Faith is common for any acquisition of knowledge, whether biology, botany, chemistry,"

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/kmO-HeLRBHw?t=203",
      "transcript": "physics, mathematics, any branch of knowledge if you want to acquire, faith is common. But not blind faith. Faith in an authorized source of that knowledge. Why we have faith in the science books? Because the science books are being taught in an authorized college, by an authorized professor. We are not going to some sabjeevala and learning what is the components of water, what is the chemical composition of water. We are not going to some street vendor who is illiterate and learning from him, right? We are going to an authorized college and authorized professor and authorized textbooks we are studying and we are learning from that. So that faith in an authorized source of knowledge is essential for acquiring knowledge. So that faith in an authorized source of knowledge is essential for acquiring knowledge. Any branch of knowledge without that faith, fundamental faith, nobody can acquire any knowledge. This is the reality. So, similarly, in for acquiring spiritual knowledge also, you have to have faith in the authorized source of that spiritual knowledge. So, just like we have textbooks which are prescribed by the university which are called authorized sources of knowledge, material knowledge, But similarly, for acquiring spiritual knowledge, the authorized books are Bhagavad Gita, Srimad Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures. So if we acquire knowledge from them, we will be able to, we will, if we have faith in those authorized books of spiritual knowledge, we will be able to acquire spiritual knowledge. And just like in the science books, first you have faith in the college and the teacher and the textbook, go and sit in the classroom, hear the theory, then you go to the lab and conduct the experiment. You will be able to see for yourself how the theory is correct, yes or no? But for you to conduct that experiment also, first you should have faith that yes, college is authorized, textbook is authorized, this knowledge being taught to me is authorized. If you have no faith, hey, this is all bogus, yeah, you will never acquire any knowledge. So with that faith, you first go and learn the theory. Then you go to the lab and do the practical experiments. Then whatever you learned in theory gets validated, our faith in that source of knowledge becomes stronger. This is the phenomenon which is working in science also."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/kmO-HeLRBHw?t=355",
      "transcript": "Same thing, same principle works even for spiritual knowledge also. You have faith in the authorized scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, and you study that and apply those principles in your life, you will be able to see the results which are predicted. In the end, you will be able to see the results which are predicted in the Bhagavad Gita and in the Vedic scriptures. And if you do that, so what happens? You are validating, you are applying the principles, practically you are applying them in the laboratory of your life. In the, to study science, the laboratory for you is some classroom within the college or school. In the case of spiritual knowledge, the laboratory is yours. You apply, you experiment. By applying those spiritual principles in your life, you will be able to see the results. You are validating, you are doing studies according to those spiritual principles in your life, and you validate whatever is told in the Vedic scriptures, that way your faith grows. So, when we speak of any branch of knowledge, we need to have faith in that branch of knowledge. Without that, we cannot acquire any system of knowledge. So, when we speak of overthinking or overthinking, then it is not worth knowing the knowledge at all. One must never wax and notice Hay жеä président intrigued and known all his deviations andmm eternal. One must never lose attention to knowledge all the time. Without it, one cannot, we cannot acquire any system of knowledge."
