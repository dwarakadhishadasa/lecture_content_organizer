      "transcript": "The Pandavas' life is a wonderful life of surrender and dependence on the Lord. Bhima was once fed a poisoned cake and Krishna protected him. Bhima was made to fight a man-eater, Hidimba, a demon, but Krishna protected them. They were put into a wax house and the wax house was put into fire, but Krishna protected them. They tried to disrobe Draupadi, Krishna protected them by supplying unlimited amounts of cloth. Look at their perseverance of the Pandavas. Repeatedly, they were put into these sufferings. In the Kurukshetra war also, Krishna protected Arjuna. And then, when everything was over, they won the battle. The son of Dronacharya, he shot the Brahmastra in the womb of Uttara and still Krishna protected him."

So, this is the confidence a devotee should always have, the faith a devotee should have: God is there with me. Whatever difficulties are arising in our life, it is all due to a plan of the Lord, and protection of the Lord will also happen as per His plan. So now, how Krishna will protect me? Now Krishna is not there, the name is there. That name will protect me. So, we must take this name very seriously, very sincerely, chant very attentively, and then Krishna's protection is guaranteed."
