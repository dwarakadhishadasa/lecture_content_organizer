The meaning of this verse is: The Supreme Lord Shri Krishna, whose glories and activities are pleasing to hear, at once appears on the seat of my heart as if called for. As soon as I begin to hear, I will be able to hear. प्रगायतस्व वीर्याणी तीर्थपाद प्रियश्रवाह आहूत इवमे शीग्रम दर्शनम याति चेतसी. The Supreme Lord appears on the seat of his heart at once, as soon as he sings the glories, as if Narad Muni is calling out for the Lord. Like that, the Lord appears immediately."

      "transcript": "The very opening verse, it is said by Vyasadeva, the author of the Bhagavatam, that I meditate upon Shri Krishna because he is the Absolute Truth. सत्यं परं धीमही. सत्यं परं सत्यं परं सत्यं is truth. परं there indicates Absolute Truth. So what is this Absolute Truth? Absolute Truth is Truth which is... Truth in all phases of time: past, present, and future. The Truth is always the Truth. It doesn't change. Relative Truth is Truth which is not true in all phases of time. Every Truth in the material world of some material object or material activity is a Relative Truth. If... To give an example, if I say such and such a gentleman is residing in a particular apartment or house. Now this statement is a Relative Truth because what happens with time, in course of time, that gentleman who's staying in a particular house, when he passes away, when he changes body, when he dies, then that statement, 'such and such a gentleman residing in the house,' is no longer true. Then we are to say he was residing, and when he died, he is no longer residing in the house, or even when he shifts from that residence due to whatever reason to another residence, then that statement, 'such a gentleman is residing in this house,' is no longer true. So like this, every statement we make about a material phenomenon in this world is a relative truth. It is relative to time, whereas the absolute personality of Godhead Krishna is absolute truth. He is always the Lord. He doesn't change his body. He doesn't change his position. His form, his name, his qualities, his forms don't change. You look at our own form, material body, it changes. They... He knows when you thought they... Hey, come on, your venom, Jara, anything material, it is constantly undergoing change. That's the..."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/lVBk_IkI5HY?t=390",
      "transcript": "Spiritual existence is not changing, unchanging reality. So unchanging reality should not be mistaken to be something which is uninteresting in the material world because inherently in anything material, there is no Rasa. Therefore, everything material is actually without any substance. It is without substance, is without life, really speaking, without any Vasu, whereas spiritual existence is full of Rasa. Minute coworkers are... How is it interesting if it is unchanging? It is interesting because spiritual existence is full of rasa, even though unchanging. How is it interesting? It is... Spirit is dynamic, unlike matter. Matter is static, spirit is dynamic. So spirit is always alive, full of life. Spirit is actually full of life, and that life never expires, just like we say, we understand from the Bhagavad Gita that this real person inside this body, the spirit soul, does not die, is always living but changes body. The body is something which is material, is subject to deterioration, and one day we have to quit this body when it becomes old and useless. So spirit is dynamic, spirit is full of life, spirit is actually full of Rasa. That is because the Supreme Lord, personality of Godhead Krishna, the absolute personality of Godhead, he is the ultimate reality, ultimate person, the ultimate source from him everything is emanating."

So as soon as a pure devotee engages himself in the pure devotional service of hearing, chanting, and remembering the name, fame, and activities of the Lord, a pure devotee is engaged always in devotional service. What does devotional service consist of? Nine different kinds of activities: shravanam kirtanam smaranam paada sevanam archanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atmanivedanam, of which three are particularly mentioned here, the first three: hearing, chanting, and remembering, shravanam kirtanam smaranam. About what? Hearing about what, or chanting, or remembering what? The name, fame, and activities of the Lord. That is the recommendation in the Bhagavata: shravanaam kirtanam Vishno smaranam paada sevanam, about Vishnu, about the Supreme Lord. We have to hear about his names, his qualities, his pastimes, his forms, his paraphernalia, his Abode, his devotees, his relationships, his creation, his maintenance, destruction, everything about him when we hear that, or we chant about it, or we remember them..."

      "transcript": "At once, the Supreme Lord becomes visible to the transcendental eyes of the pure devotee. This ordinary eyes, we cannot see anything spiritual. How do the pure devotees see? They with transcendental eyes. And how do they see with transcendental eyes? That is described here by reflecting himself on the mirror of the heart of the spiritual... Prabhupada uses a term called spiritual television. Just like you have got experience of a material television, you have a television at home. Now the program that is broadcast by a station, you tune in or you connect to that station through your whatever the set of box or whatever, then the program being broadcast appears on your television screen, and you are able to see that program. That program is going on somewhere, either it is recorded and the recording is broadcast, or live it is going on. Let's say a cricket match is going on in Australia, and you are sitting in India, you can watch that cricket match live through this arrangement of television, is it not? Same way, there is something called a spiritual television. What is the spiritual television? That when a devotee sings the Lord's name or hears about the Lord's glories or remembers the Lord's glorification which he has heard before or recited before, immediately the Lord appears in his heart like a spiritual television is switched on. He reflects himself on the mirror of the heart by spiritual television, and this is possible for anybody who is engaged in pure devotional service. Seeing the Lord within the heart reflected by the spiritual television is possible for anyone who engages in pure devotional service of hearing or chanting or remembering. Therefore, a pure devotee who is related with the Lord in loving transcendental service can experience the presence of the Lord at every moment. What is the nature of pure devotees? They're always engaged in devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, they are always experiencing the presence of the Lord every moment because as soon as they sing or hear or do devotional service, the Lord is appearing on their heart."

From the spiritual point of view of the Lord, they are doing it with the intention of receiving the glory of the Lord. There are also other ways of receiving the glory of the Lord, just by hearing the glory of the Lord, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord from pure devotees."
