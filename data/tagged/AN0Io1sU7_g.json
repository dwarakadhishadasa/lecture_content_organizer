      "transcript": "So, this is the spot where Narottam Das Thakur had his last Leela. Narottam Das Thakur was absorbed in singing the glories of Lord Gauranga and Nityananda, day and night. By the mercy of his lotus feet, several atheists, agnostics, offenders, demigod worshippers, dry logicians, speculators, etc. were all delivered. Hearing the terrible news of the disappearance of Sri Ramachandra Kaviraj, who was a very dear friend, Narottama plunged into an ocean of grief. Added to his grief, shortly, the spiritual master of Ramachandra, Sri Srinivasacharya, also left this planet. Arriving at Gambila, Narottam Das Thakur ordered his disciples, Sri Ramakrishna and Ganga Narayan Chakravarti, to arrange for his bathing in Padma. He entered the waters after repeatedly paying his obeisances. Standing there in the water, he then ordered his disciples to wipe his body. Then, as Ganga Narayan and Ramakrishna were cleansing the body of their spiritual master, Sri Narottama merged into the waters of Padma and vanished from worldly view. His disappearance was just as milk vanishes in water. It is believed that Thakur Mahasaya wrapped up his earthly Leela and manifested his disappearance."

One day after in the morning, Narottama Das Thakura began to helplessly shed tears while signing deeply. He lay down on the ground for some time and his lotus-like face became pale. With a choked-up voice, he sang this song in great lamentation. Swaroopa, Roopa, Sanatana, Raghunatha and the Bhattas, be kind to me. Acharya Srinivasa, whose servant is Ramachandra, can I have their association once again? Without seeing their face, my heart is pierced, just like a doe struck by a poisonous arrow. I kept my jewels hidden under my cloth. Who has stolen them? Why is Narottama suffering so much?"

However, there was no chance for them to do this because merely by touch of their hands, Narottama Das Thakur Mahasaya's body melted and vanished into the Ganges.

When the devotees started Sankirtana in the courtyard of Lord Gauranga's temple, Devi Dasa, Gauranga, Gokula, Govinda Kaviraj and others soon forgot their external identities and began to roll on the ground. They rolled like lions and soaked the ground with their tears. Suddenly, due to the favor of their guru, Krishna, and the Vaishnavas, everyone had a chance to witness Narottama Das dancing with them again. When he suddenly vanished, everyone lost their composure. And so Narottama Das Thakur once again appeared and consoled them all.

They complained to King Narasimha that the audacious Shudra, Narottam Das, had brazenly initiated a brahmana into the fold of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. The king, the Smarthas, and the Digvijaya Pandit were to challenge and conquer the upstart Narottam Das.

At Bada Govinda Bari Temple, rests today the enchanting Golden Gauranga Deity, that was once worshipped by Narottam Das Thakura. There is a very interesting pastime regarding how Narottam Das Thakur discovered this Gauranga Deity. In the province of Gopalpur, there lived a pious Brahmana. He was a Brahmin. He was a Brahmin. He was a Brahmin. His name was Vipra Dasa. Mahaprabhu revealed to Narottam Das Thakura in his dream one night that his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deities were presently resting at the house of this Brahmana. These Deities lay hidden in his huge container of paddy. When Mahaprabhu left Bengal for Puri, after accepting his sannyas initiation, he manifested these enchanting Deities and hid them inside his paddy. In the course of time, they landed up in the house of this Brahmana. But this Brahmana was completely unaware of this. So when Narottam Das Thakur arrived at the house of this Brahmana the next day and wanted to look into his huge mount of paddy, the Brahmana warned him that a huge venomous snake lived in it, and it was not safe to go near it. Regardless, Shri Narottama entered the paddy container. He was very happy. He entered the paddy container, and immediately the huge snake appeared and walked out of the mount. All present were very filled with wonder. Soon Thakura Mahasaya discovered his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deities from the paddy and grabbed them dearly. The onlookers began loudly glorifying Narottam Das and shouted, Haribol! Haribol! Haribol! Haribol! Wherever Narottam Das Thakur went, he carried his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deity to the mountain. Haribol! Haribol! Haribol! He took his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deity and took him along with him. Narottam Das was mad in ecstasy love, ecstatic love with his beloved Gauravishnupriya Deity. So when Narottam Das Thakura arrived at the villa at the residence of Ganga Narayan for the final time before he merged with the Ganges, he had carried this golden Gauravishniya Deity along with him from Keturi. This beautiful Deity has remained at Badok Govindabhari ever since."
