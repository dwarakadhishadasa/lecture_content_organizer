      "transcript": "There is a very nice pastime of Ramachandra Kaviraj and Srinivasa Acharya. Basically, this is Srinivasa Acharya's. Of course, Ramachandra Kaviraj is whose disciple? Srinivasa Acharya's disciple. Once while residing at Vishnupur, Sri Srinivasa Acharya became suddenly engrossed in deep meditation. He became absorbed watching and relishing the eternal pastimes of Sri Radha and Krishna in Yamuna. This is one of the characteristics of exalted devotees. They are qualified to relish the eternal pastimes of Sri Radha and Krishna in Yamuna. Srinivasa Acharya, who was the incarnation of Mani Manjari, could see that Radharani was so absorbed in her play that she did not notice her nose ring falling off her nose into the waters. Sri Rupa Manjari informed Gunam Manjari of the nose ring's loss, who in turn asked Mani Manjari to find it in the Yamuna. All the other gopis returned home. And who is Mani Manjari? Srinivasa Acharya."

      "transcript": "So Mani Manjari, Srinivasa Acharya, began looking for the ring, but she could not find it. Meanwhile, when Srinivasa's wife noticed that their husband was absorbed in meditation for an unusually long period of time, they became very anxious and alarmed. The whole day passed and yet he did not come out of his trance. The news spread far and wide and even the king of Vishnupur, who was a disciple of Srinivasa, arrived at the scene. When they saw that Srinivasa's meditation was unbroken, even at noon the next day, they called for Ramachandra Kaviraj, who was then the disciple of Srinivasa. He was residing at Telliya Budhari, near Bhagavangola. Ramachandra arrived and examined his Gurudeva and assured all that he would soon regain external consciousness. Saying this, he sat down and entered into a deep meditation. Ramachandra Kaviraj, who was an incarnation of Karuna Manjari, could see his worshipable Gurudeva was with him within the waters of Yamuna, in the spiritual Brindavan. Karuna Manjari entered into the waters as well and found Radhika's nose ring from under the leaf inside the water. Finding the nose ring, the two little girls went and handed it over to Guna Manjari, who in turn handed it to Rupa Manjari, who placed it upon Radhika's nose. All present began glorifying Radhika's astounding beauty. Guna Manjari was very pleased and Ramachandra Kaviraj handed over her chewed betel nut remnants as his reward."

      "transcript": "After relishing this wonderful sight, Ramachandra and Srinivasa's meditation broke and they regained their external consciousness. Srinivasa embraced Ramachandra Kaviraj, who offered his respectful obeisances onto the lotus feet. Ramachandra still had with him the betel nut remnants of Radharani in his hands, and he thereafter distributed the Mahaprasadam onto all present. Being relieved, all the devotees glorified the two of them and blissfully chanted the Lord's holy name. So these personalities are called Vibhuti Patis. They are Lords in both the Vibhuti of the Lord. The material world is one Vibhuti of the Lord, a small portion. The spiritual world is the main Vibhuti of the Lord. So these personalities can, while being in this material world, be in the spiritual world also, and take part in the Leelas in the spiritual world also. So there is Ramachandra Kaviraj, the disciple of Srinivasa Acharya, who helped Srinivasa Acharya."
