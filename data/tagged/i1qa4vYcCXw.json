What did Narada do after he got initiated? In this particular chapter, Narada Muni is going to describe how he achieved the perfection, ultimate perfection, after becoming initiated. So the description continues by Narada that he lost his mother. Under the protection of his mother he was staying in a Brahmana school, a 5 year old boy. But once his mother died, Narada Muni lost his mother. He was going for milking a cow and she was bitten by a snake and she died instantaneously. It was a very poisonous snake bite. So he took it as the mercy of the Lord to make him completely dependent upon the Supreme Lord, Krishna."

      "transcript": "So thinking that now he has to actually go to that sacred place for sitting and doing meditation as he had been instructed by the Bhaktivedantas, the saintly persons before his initiation. So he, Narada, the small boy, he started for north. North means the direction in which the Himalayas are situated. And in the Himalayas there are all kinds of facilities for somebody who wants to stay all alone and actually practice spiritual life. Especially in Satya Yuga the recommended method was meditation on the Lord in the heart. So Narada Muni has started, the boy, Narada Muni's previous life, the boy, young boy, five year old boy has started travelling to the north. So the eleventh verse is now going to start describing his travel. The meaning of this verse is: after my departure I passed through many flourishing metro policies, towns, flourishing metro policies, peethan janapada flourishing metropolises then pass through so many towns pura, grama, villages vraja animal farms akaran mines then kheita agricultural lands karvata valleys vatishtha flower gardens vanani nursery gardens upavanani upavanani is nursery gardens and vanani is natural forests so he passed through all such places while traveling towards the Himalayas."

      "transcript": "So very interesting purport by Srila Prabhupada, a very pertinent observation is made by Srila Prabhupada. Kindly note this. Prabhupada says in the purport, \"Man's activities in agriculture, mining, farming, industries, gardening etc. were all on the same scale as they are now.\" Sometimes we think when we read so-called history that there was a primitive civilization of man was very primitive condition caveman and then gradually evolved to become the present civilized society but that is not the fact. Man's activities in all these fields agriculture mining farming industries gardening etc. were on the same scale as they are now even previous to the present creation and the same activities will remain as they are even in the next creation cyclically this is going on creation maintenance destruction again creation maintenance destruction in a day of Brahma in a day of Brahma of course there are changes that happen even within one day of Brahma but at the beginning of the day of Brahma there is creation and the end of day of Brahma there is destruction so in between there is there are changes taking place with essentially man's activities at least on the earth are similar to what was there in a previous creation. So, Srila Prabhupada says, after many hundreds of millions of years, one creation is started by the law of nature and the history of the universe repeats itself practically in the same way. It is out of necessity that human beings have to do cultivation of the field and then there are forests which give certain produce without any human endeavor by the arrangement of the Supreme Lord through the nature, mother nature and then there are mines which has got deposits of different minerals, different metals, that mining activity was always there even in the past and it is there now and will be there in the future also. So, the history of the universe repeats itself practically in the same way. As far as major activities are concerned among the different classes of people on different planets, it repeats itself. Now, here is the important observation that Srila Prabhupada is making. The mundane wranglers waste time and energy. They waste time with archeological excavations without searching into the vital necessities of life. So, mundane wranglers. Mundane means they are only concerned with matter and material things and material existence. They are not have understanding of something beyond matter. They do not know who they are. They do not know their spirit. They don't know there is a spiritual dimension to existence in every human being, every living being actually, particularly in a human being. And there is a spiritual world beyond this material world, which is eternal. Of this, there are people who have no knowledge, no idea, no trace of any understanding. Totally zero when it comes to spiritual understanding. So they are called mundane wranglers."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/i1qa4vYcCXw?t=579",
      "transcript": "They are simply busy with material things. And they are fascinated if they discover something by excavation. Some ancient civilization, they had beautiful buildings. They had a... They had, you know, gold coins. They had a system of mining and purifying. Metallurgy was very advanced even thousands of years back. When they discover all this through excavations, then they waste so much time into rebuilding so-called history. But... What they... Are losing out is the valuable human life, the time we can spend in this human form of life into searching out the vital necessity of this human form of life. What is that? Inquiry into the absolute truth. In just three words in Vedanta Sutra, the whole thing is summarized: Athato Brahma Jijnasa. Vital necessity of life. Inquire into what is spirit. What is Brahman or who is God. Or who you are. Inquire into this. Without making this inquiry, human life is completely wasted. All the developed intelligence, the ability to ask fundamental questions and try to get meaningful answers, this opportunity is lost. It's a greatest loss for a human being. In the evolution of the consciousness through different species of life in this material world, the human form of life is the most evolved, developed state of consciousness. So, therefore, it is very well known human being is a rational animal, can think, can contemplate, can inquire, can learn, can teach, can do so many things with this developed intelligence, developed consciousness. So, the most important inquiry, the most important inquiry is inquiry about spirit, inquiry about God, inquiry about spiritual reality. That's called Brahma Jijnasa. And that is the most important part of a Vedic knowledge."

      "transcript": "Vedic knowledge, clearly there are two departments: material knowledge and spiritual knowledge. Of these two, spiritual knowledge is the most important because that is the vital necessity of a human being. Why? Just by studying, understanding, realizing your spirit soul, all your problems are solved. Your life is ultimately a success. You can end the repetition of birth and death. You can solve all your problems only by realizing the truth that you are spirit. And of course, the supreme absolute truth is the supreme spirit, Krishna. And you have got a relationship. Three things. But it begins with inquiry into who am I. Essentially, who am I? Am I this body? Am I something different from the body? Or this inquiry is the most important inquiry. So, instead of wasting time inquiring into what was this civilization like 300 years back or 500 years back, what kind of buildings were they building, what were they eating, what were they doing for entertainment, all these kind of things are waste of human energy. That is what is being pointed out. So, after getting his impetus in spiritual life, Narad Muni, even as a 5 year old boy, did not waste time a single moment with economic development. Although he passed through all these towns, villages, mines, industries, he continually went on till he reached that sacred holy place to sit and do meditation. That was his aim. So, we will continue this discussion in the next session."
