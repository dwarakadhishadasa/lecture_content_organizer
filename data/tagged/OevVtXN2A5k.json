      "transcript": "Wherever you go within this material world, either in the Brahma-loka or in the Pātlā-loka, you have to die. That is the problem. So Hiraṇā Kaśipu wanted to solve this in a materialistic way, but that is not possible. So in a negative way, he wanted that I shall not die on the land, I shall not die in the air, I shall not die in the water, I shall not be killed by any man-made weapon. In so many ways, negatively, he thought that he has become immortal. But Kṛṣṇa is so intelligent that, keeping all the words or the blessings given by Lord Brahmā to Hiraṇā Kaśipu, He cannot kill anyone. So we cannot cheat God. That is not possible. However scientifically we may be advanced, God is always more intelligent than ourselves. We should always remember."
