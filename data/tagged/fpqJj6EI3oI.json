In this session we will be discussing from three verses, verse numbers 1, 2 and 3 of the 19th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. We are beginning a new chapter. This 19th chapter of the first canto is entitled The Appearance of Shukadeva Goswami. This is text number 1. The meaning of this verse is: Shri Suta Goswami said, \"While returning home, the king Maharaj Pariksha felt that the act he had committed against the faultlessness of the king was not right. The powerful brahmana was heinous and uncivilized. Consequently, he was distressed. The pious king regretted his accidental improper treatment of the powerful brahmana who was faultless. Such repentance is natural for a good man like the king, and such repentance delivers a devoted heart. The devotees are naturally faultless. Accidental sins committed by a devotee are sincerely regretted, and by the grace of the Lord, all sins unwittingly committed by a devotee are burnt in the fire of repentance.\" So essentially, Srila Prabhupada is telling that Pariksit, being a pure devotee, is naturally faultless, but accidentally he committed a mistake, and he was very, very repentant about it. So in the fire of repentance, such sinful reactions are burnt away."

I now desire without reservation that the calamity come now, for in this way I may be freed of this sinful action and not commit such an offense again.\" In this verse, Pariksit is thinking to himself, while he is returning home, that Pariksit has certainly neglected to follow the injunctions of the Supreme Lord. Now what are the injunctions of the Supreme Lord? That is explained in the purport, which we will just read. And because of that, he definitely is expecting to face some problem, some difficulty. Now he also is desiring that let that calamity happen now. Why? Because he will be then freed from that sinful action, and it will also be a lesson for him that he will never again commit such an offense. So this is sincere repentance by Pariksit,"

      "transcript": "In the purport, Srila Prabhupada says, \"The Supreme Lord enjoins that Brahmanas and cows must be given all protection. The Lord is himself very much inclined to do good to Brahmanas and cows. go brāhmaṇa hitāya ca.\" There is one prayer to Krishna: namo brahmaṇya devāya go brāhmaṇa hitāya ca jagadhitāya kṛṣṇaya govindāya namo namah. So in this prayer to Krishna, it is clearly declared that Krishna is very much inclined, go brāhmaṇa hitāya ca, for the welfare of go brāhmaṇa, cows and the brāhmaṇas. Maharaj Pariksit knew all this and thus he concluded that his insulting a powerful brāhmaṇa was certainly to be punished by the laws of the Lord. Laws of nature are the laws of God, and they operate in this material world very impartially, very strictly. Nobody can escape them. Somebody may escape the laws of the government, but nobody can escape the laws of God or laws of nature. And it is said further, he was expecting something very difficult in the very near future. He therefore desired the imminent calamity to fall on him and not on his family members. Why is this? Because it is said here, a man's personal misconduct affects all his family members. Therefore Maharaj Pariksit desired the calamity to fall on him alone, not on his family members. By suffering personally, he would be restrained from future sins, and at the same time, the sin which he had committed would be counteracted so that his descendants would not suffer. That is the way a responsible devotee thinks, very, very disciplined in thinking, speaking and acting. Through mind, through words, and through the body, we act three ways. So all of them are very regulated, restrained in the case of a devotee, a responsible devotee. The family members of a devotee also share the effects of a devotee's service to the Lord. Example is given by Srila Prabhupada, Maharaj Prahlad saved his demon father by his personal devotional service. A devotee's son in the family is the greatest boon."

The meaning of this third verse is, \"I am uncivilized and sinful due to my neglect of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection. Therefore I wish that my kingdom, strength and riches burn up immediately by the fire of the Brahman's wrath so that in the future I may not be guided by such inauspicious attitudes.\" So this is another description in the Bhagavatam, in this chapter, that Pariksit was very, very, very repentant about the mistake he had done, and he wants the reaction to come immediately now. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, progressive human civilization is based on Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and protection of cows. dvijadeva gobhyahā. This is the Sanskrit that is used in this verse. vijā refers to the Brahmanical culture, deva refers to God consciousness, gobhyahā refers to protection of cows. All economic development of the state by trade, commerce, agriculture and industries must be fully utilized in relation to the above principles, the principles of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection. Otherwise, all so-called economic development becomes a source of degradation. If economic development does not actually result in taking care of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and cow protection, then such economic development is useless."

      "transcript": "Human society will not make real progress without such principles being adhered to. Cow protection means feeding the Brahmanical culture, which leads towards God consciousness, and thus, the perfection of human civilization is achieved. The age of Kali aims at killing the higher principles of life. Kali Yuga is an age in which the influence of Kali promotes irreligion. Kali is called adharma bandhu. Kali influence spreads irreligion. The influence of Kali is the same throughout the state. Therefore, the age of Kali aims at killing the higher principles of life. Although Maharaj Pariksit strongly resisted the domination of the personality of Kali within the world, the influence of the age of Kali came at an opportune moment, and even a strong king like Maharaj Pariksit was induced to disregard the Brahmanical culture due to a slight provocation of hunger and thirst. How did Maharaj Pariksit commit this mistake? He was extremely thirsty and hungry. Now, such hunger and thirst is not difficult to tolerate for a great soul like Maharaj Pariksit, but somehow, it so happened that he did commit this mistake while he was thirsty and tired and looking for drinking water. Maharaj Pariksit lamented the accidental incident and he desired that all his kingdom strength and accumulation of wealth would be burned up for not being engaged in Brahmanical culture, etc. He wanted punishment, and that punishment also, should be such that he learns a lesson, he does not commit a similar mistake in the future, and also, the sin is counteracted so that the future generations of his family are not affected. So, considering all this, he wanted that immediately, he get the reaction. So, Srila Prabhupada says, the lesson for us is, where wealth and strength are not engaged in the advancement of Brahmanical culture, God consciousness, and God protection, the state and home are surely doomed."

This is the conclusion by Srila Prabhupada. I will stop here. Thank you very much."
