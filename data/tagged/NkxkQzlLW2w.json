      "transcript": "We must have a mission in our life, so you should be preoccupied. There must be something very exalted in your life that you are pursuing. That's what gives meaning to your life, otherwise life is miserable. I was reading one Australian psychologist, he says, \"When you get up in the morning, that exalted thing that you are pursuing in life should be the foremost thing that comes to your mind, and that energizes you. Wow, let me get up and do the work.\" Vedic culture tells us that the most exalted thing in human life that we should all be doing is self-realization. There are different grades of self-realization, and then there is the highest level of self-realization, and that is awakening our own relationship with the Lord. That should be the dominant thing in our life when we wake up in the morning. That should come to our mind. Prabhupada wants us to pursue very sublime."
