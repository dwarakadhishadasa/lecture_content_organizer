So if you simply know that you are welcoming him, you are welcoming him, there is no question of any other alternative for our mind than to receive him, swagadam, welcome him, and our attention should embrace that sound."

That is why that taste comes, because in Shakti Avesha Nama, first you will get taste of Shakti, you get empowered without tiring. By the mercy of the Lord, you will be able to go on chanting, wanting to chant more and more. Just like if you like somebody's association, then you want more and more of that association, is it not? Similarly for us, immediately to feel that I like the association of Satchidananda, the Satchidananda is Nama on my tongue, where our spiritual senses, our spiritual mind and attention is all dull now. I told you, dreamy attention. Because of that we are not able to appreciate the presence of Satchidananda, Nama."

      "transcript": "We are unable to. Yet the fact remains that something is flowing into us. Another example I have given several times is about if you wear rubber gloves on your hand and you keep it on a hot plate, you won't feel the heat. But if you hold it for some time, slowly you will feel the heat. Why? Because the heat goes through the rubber gloves and then you start feeling it. In the same way, even though Shakti Avesha Nama is on my tongue, if I chant and hear, I am not getting the full taste. Please understand, because still the rubber gloves is there. My mind is contaminated. My Chittam is contaminated. Through the contaminated, through the gloves only I am touching. My attention is coming through that and touching. So I will definitely not feel the full. Somebody asked if I have Satchidananda, why immediately I am not enlightened. So limitation is us."

And bead after bead we will feel this warmth. I don't want to mislead you by saying that okay you will become ecstatic, bead after bead if you chant and hear that very sound. No, it will take time, but heat will come. Some heat will come. And you go on. What is that called? Embrace. Continue the attention embrace. What will happen? More and more heat as it comes, more duration you hold, more heat reaches your head. Slowly it will also melt the rubber. This exact action of the Shakti Ayesha Nama. It will melt. It will dissolve our false ego. Dissolve our illusions."

This false ego is like the rubber gloves, going to go on melting. Finally real ego is there. Real ego is there. Then real mind is there. Spiritual mind is there. It awakens. Then spiritual tongue awakens. Spiritual mind, senses, ears awaken. You can chant and hear the Shuddha Nama of the Lord, unmodified. Un是啊. Only the Shuddhas can do it. You can do it. It doesn't really matter. When you connect to the Shuddhas it doesn't matter. Any spiritual environment is the same. As long as you connect to them it is the same. Everything is in harmony. And sudden spiritual realization takes place. When you connect to the Dhamma you feel all things. As long as you connect to the Dhamma you feel all things. When you connect to the Dhamma you feel all things as well."
