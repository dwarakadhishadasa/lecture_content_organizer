Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 3, Chapter 22, Text No. 5: Tavasandarshanadeva Chinname Sarvasamchayaha Yatsvayam Bhagavanpretya Dharmamaharirakshisho. Translation and purport by His Divine Grace Shri La Prabhupada: Now I have resolved all my doubts simply by meeting you, for your lordship has very kindly and clearly explained the duty of a king who desires to protect his subjects. PURPORT BY SHRI LA PRABHUPADA: Manu described herewith the result of seeing a great saintly person. Lord Chaitanya says that one should always try to associate with saintly persons, because if one establishes a proper association with a saintly person, even for a moment, one attains all perfection. Somehow or other, if one meets a saintly person and achieves his favour, then the entire mission of one's human life is fulfilled. In our personal experience, we have actual proof of this statement of Manu. Once, we had the opportunity to meet Vishnupat Shri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj and on first sight, he requested this humble self to preach his message in the western countries. There was no preparation for this but somehow or other, he desired it and by his grace, we are now engaged in executing his order which has given us a transcendental occupation and has saved and liberated us from the occupation of material activities. Thus, it is actually a fact that if one meets a saintly person completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favour, then one's life mission becomes complete. What is not possible to achieve in thousands of lives can be achieved in one moment if there is an opportunity to meet a saintly person. It is therefore enjoined in Vedic literature that one should always try to associate with saintly persons and try to dissociate oneself from the common man because by one word of a saintly person, one can be liberated from material entanglement. A saintly person has the power because of his spiritual advancement to give immediate liberation to the conditioned soul. Here Manu admits that all his doubts are now over because Karadhamma has very kindly"

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/GFHkEL1Sipk?t=341",
      "transcript": "Here, Srila Prabhupada in the Bhaktivedanta purports, he explains the principle of association with great saintly persons. Even a moment of association, sadhu-sangha, one can attain all perfection by achieving his favor. This is a very important principle in the process of spiritual advancement for every devotee. Normally, everything in this world is achieved. That's the paradigm of everyone, that I work hard and I have to achieve. I work hard and I have to be successful. So when we come to spiritual life also, naturally the tendency is to think that I work very hard for my sadhana, etc. and then result is guaranteed. In other words, it's like making spiritual advance, turning spiritual advancement to simply following some process. In the material world, it's like that. You go through a process, the result has to be there in the end. So we have to be very careful in our mind to change this paradigm. This paradigm has been ingrained into us through our education system. We are all victim of this. By default, our thinking is like this. It is only when you understand the principle of spiritual flow of mercy, how actually spiritual growth happens, not like how you learn in school. Spiritual growth happens by constant shower of mercy of the spiritual master, mercy of the deities, mercy of prasadam, mercy of great devotees like Tulsimaharani, mercy of holy rivers, mercy of holy dham."

      "transcript": "What is this mercy, mercy, mercy? How does it impact me? How does it impact a sadhaka? Spiritual advancement means receiving key understandings through the descending process. At least we should, even if our mind is stuck in a process-oriented thinking, turn it into it is a descending process. That today if I have some advancement, it's not because I read Prabhupada's books alone, not because I thought a lot and I understood. It is because I read Prabhupada's books and Prabhupada gave his mercy. It is because I thought about all this and Krishna in the heart gave me the realization. Realization and understanding. So everything that we have today is a combination of whatever we desire, whatever is our attitude towards the desire and what we have received from a transcendental source. All that we receive from a transcendental source, it is not temporary. It is permanent. It stays with us. In the material world, so many energies come and go. You say spiritual, if you do your PhD this life, next life that knowledge is gone. But if there is a mercy of from the transcendental source of enlightenment, that will remain with the soul even though it may get covered, but doesn't matter. It remains. It's an eternal asset for the soul."

      "transcript": "So our business in spiritual life will be successful if we constantly collect mercy. Of course you cannot go on like plucking a flower, you cannot collect mercy. Mercy has to be begged. So the begging mode, anticipating mode is extremely important for a devotee. The devotee is constantly in the mode of begging and anticipating the mercy of the Lord in various forms. Just like we can say, okay, every day we are coming for sadhana, it is a process. 4.15 you have to be there, then samsara dava has to be sung, then Tulsi has to be, Tulsi Maharani's song has to be sung, she has to be glorified, then you go, Prabhupada Puja, etc., etc., all these processes you have to follow. So in the neophyte, a devotee thinks, this is, okay, I have to go for this, I have to go for this, this is a process. Even though externally every day it appears to be the same thing, 4.15 Mangalarati, 4.15 same song, every day same song, samsara dava, samsara dava, samsara dava, you don't get bored? 30, 40 years same song, samsara dava, you don't get bored. The fact is that we don't get bored. Why? Every day the mercy coming out of the altar to each devotee is different. Externally it is same, internally it is different. What plays in the devotee's heart, his understanding, his realization, his situation for that day, his faith, his prayers, all are different. So you don't get bored. That is a variety. So every day is different. Every day Mangalarati is different. Every day Guru Puja is different. Every day Tulasi Aarti is different."

There is another kind of contamination when there is an imbalanced effort on a devotee's path, Jnanic path. You have to think, think, think. You have to cross sometimes this thinking stage. Sometimes you have to think. We all thought about it and came to Krishna consciousness. Go on thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking everything. When we have to put effort to think, then that is speculation. Thinking is not wrong, but thinking will automatically come. Thoughts will automatically come. When you struggle to think, then it is Jnana-Prayasa. Then it is Jnana-Prayasa. Unnecessary endeavor. You have a philosophical question, you think too much, you cannot answer now. Jnana-Prayasa. Wait, get the Adhikara. Get the qualification. Adhikara for the soul means enough more services to be done. You have to raise your spiritual platform. Then you will get the answer. Then you will have qualification to understand the answer. It is not that for every question that you ask, you have to get an answer now. What is the use of you getting the answer if you cannot understand the answer? So the question has to be raised, no doubt. It is our nature to raise question. But then we have to understand that ultimately the Adhikara, the qualification comes when the spiritual master is pleased, when Guru is pleased, Srila Prabhupada is pleased with the devotee who is sincerely trying to advance and who is trying to serve him because ultimately essence of all Jnana is what? Service to the Lord. Essence of all realization is what? Devotional service to the Lord."

That is why Prabhupada always stressed, distribute my books, distribute my books, distribute my books. This is the most important thing that Prabhupada considers as his contribution to the world, are not the temples, but it is the books. Srila Prabhupada himself has considered this to be most important contribution, which is coming from the spiritual world under the order of the Guru Parampara and Krishna, that he has contributed this to this world. It is his books. His books means his words. How by Lord Krishna's arrangement everything is recorded, every lecture he gave is recorded. Nowadays it is very common. In those days in 1965 and all, it has just come into being. Record player and all, just come into being. Even videos, audios and all, few black and white and all, it has just started. All those things are captured. Just imagine, you know, we are able to carry in a small, small empathy player, 800 lectures of a pure devotee. Imagine if you hear 800 lectures nicely, what will happen to you? Nothing is happening to us because we don't hear. It is available. We don't hear. Now the problem is not availability of mercy. Nobody wants to collect."

Perceiving, those things are perceiving the person. How do, a devotee asked me, how to be conscious of Prabhupada? It's not simply his form. You get stuck there. The person can be perceived by his interest. The person can be perceived by his determination. By his personal qualities, you can perceive a person. You can pinpoint, very uniquely, who was Prabhupada, by his determination to go to America and preach, by his desire to please his spiritual master, by his aspiration to spread Lord Chaitanya's movement to everywhere, irrespective of any country. His confidence and trust that the Holy Name is powerful enough to change everyone."

You are doing something and Prabhupada and Krishna is doing something to you. If this perception is there, then thinking of this as a process is fine. But normally in this material world, process generally means it's you put your effort only and the result has to be there. Or even your effort, somebody, all other people's effort, it's all visible, grossly visible efforts. In the material world also, process sometimes means this way and that way, people, all those things, combination, combination of... Just like a factory produces something, they say it is a... It was a process of teamwork, they will say. But here, it's not visible like that. It's a transcendental process. That means your effort you can see, grossly. But, the other effort that, that other mercy that comes from Prabhupada and Krishna and Lord in the heart, these things cannot be seen. If you are Shrabdha, you can capture it. You know this is coming from... You feel that it is mercy. So think of the process as a transcendental process of effort and mercy. Shrama, cheshta from our side, kripa from the Lord. Kripa from transcendence, effort from our side. So,"

Unless one is authorized by the predecessor spiritual master, one cannot become guru. That is why Prabhupada did not authorize anybody."
