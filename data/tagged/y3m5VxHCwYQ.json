Just like Krishna says, \"I am sex life according to regulative principles.\" So, even though, that means it is a compromise. When material lust, material anger, material all these things are engaged in the service of the Lord by a conditioned soul, it gets purified. That means you become free from that lust. You become free from that anger."

Even like Bhaktivinoda Thakur says that if I can—but you know, Thakur or Bhaktis is not—but this is not so. If I can bring forth hundreds of pure devotees, I won't mind engaging in sex. Divine forces Krishna has made that to trap the living entities, correct? But if you know the real purpose, you can use that to untrap also."
