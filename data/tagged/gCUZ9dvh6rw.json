We all belong to the Lord as His associates. So, for reinstating ourselves in our original position as the associate of the Lord, Lord Krishna, we have to acquire the necessary qualification, and that qualification is to become purified of material contamination. This association with material atmosphere or material nature has resulted in our developing different kinds of attachment in our heart towards so many material things, both gross and subtle. Grossly, we are attached to material objects: my car, my house, my table, my chair, my furniture, my clothes, my ornaments. And certainly, we are attached to social status, some honor in society, some respectability in some material hierarchy. All these kinds of gross and subtle material attachments, we have to become purified of all such contamination, should become detached materially. No one can become an associate of the Lord or can go back to Godhead without such purification. This is absolutely required, essential for"

Maharaj Yudhishthira, therefore, to become spiritually pure—spiritually pure means free from all material contamination—this spiritual purity at once gave up his royal opulence, relinquishing his royal dress and garments. So, Srila Prabhupada explains one specific aspect of renunciation in the vanashrama Dharma. Prabhupada says the kashaaya or saffron loincloth of a sannyasi indicates freedom from all attractive material garments. Sympathetically, when one takes sanyasa, then one receives a saffron loincloth. But that is actually indicative of something, not that everybody has to receive a saffron copium. No, it is indicative of freedom from all attractive material garments. We adore the body so much, or we are attached to the body so much, we decorate this body in so many ways, particularly the garments and, of course, the ornaments, garments and the ornaments, decorating this body. So, we have to give up those garments and ornaments and accept some simple clothing. And what did he do? The details will be explained. He actually gave up his royal dress and garments, and the next verse will tell that he dressed himself in some rejected, discarded, torn, old garments simply to cover the body, some simple cloth, any piece of cloth available which is not at all attractive, which is not at all"

He had ruled as the emperor of the world, and in that position as the emperor of the world, he had his royal dress, he had his royal paraphernalia, he had his royal throne, he had his royal insignia, but it was required for ruling as the emperor of the world. But when he handed over charge, he no longer was keeping any of those garments or ornaments or any of the paraphernalia. Everything he gave up. In this way, he became detached from all those things. Also, it is important to understand becoming free from—it is to understand becoming free from material contamination also means becoming free from material designations. The definition of bhakti is very interesting. One of the definitions of bhakti: sarva upadhi vinir muktam. Bhakti means sarva upadhi vinir muktam. Upadhi means designation, to become free from all designations is the way"

So, Srila Prabhupada explains here, \"People are generally attached to various kinds of designations: the designations of family, society, country, occupation, wealth, position, and many others.\" We have different roles in our normal life, householder life, or family life with different roles. I am the head of some family. I am an important member of some society, or I am having a position in the country in the political administration or occupation. I may be an expert technocrat or expert skilled artisan or some very, very expert painter or whatever, or designation of wealth. Oh, he is a trillionaire, he is a billionaire, he is in Fortune 500 list, or in British society, they used to get this designation as lord and earl upon paying some huge amount of money to the government to get such titles. So many of these are the definitions of bhakti: sarva upadhi vinir muktam bhakti sarva upadhi. But too many such institutions are there which have hard according to the the wealth one possess or one can pay for getting such designations, titles. So, all these are designations which are the cause for our attachment and bondage in this material world. As long as one is attached to today's material world, such designations is considered materially impure. This is the material contamination. This is a material impurity. I am having designations. The so-called leaders of men in the modern age are attached by national consciousness, but they do not know that such false consciousness is also another designation of the materially conditioned soul. One has to relinquish such designations before one can become eligible to go back to God"

      "transcript": "head. All designations will become free. Then somebody might say that in the renounced order of life, somebody calls you Maharaj, addresses you as sannyasi, that's also a designation. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teaches in this regard how even though you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint, you are not a saint. For the sake of renouncing, we accept the renounced order formally, but you can become detached even without formally accepting the renounced order, and you should understand that to renounce means to renounce even these designations and titles within the heart. What does Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teach us? Naham vipro na cha narapati na pi vaisho na shudro naham varni na cha grahapati no vanastho yatirva. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, \"If you ask me who am I? I am not a Brahmana, I am not a Kshatriya, I am not a Vaishya, I am not a Shudra, I am not a Brahmachari, I am not a grahastha, I am not a vanaprasad, I am not a sannyasi.\" So, what does He mean by this? He means that we should not be having any designations and the associated respect and honor and kind of this thing in the society, honor in the society for every position within our heart. We should not have any of those expectations or any of those attachments or any of those false egos. We should not have any of those. Then if Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, \"I am not a Brahmin, I am not a Kshatriya, I am not a Vaishya, I am not a Shudra, I am not a Brahmachari, Ghrastha, Vana, Prasad, Sanyasin. What are you?\" Kintu Prodhyan Nikhil Paramananda Poonamrata Abder Gopi Bhartuhu Pada Kamalayor Dasa Dasa Anudasaha. \"I identify myself only as a servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the Supreme Lord Krishna who is the protector and maintainer of the Gopis.\" So, this is our constitutional position, this is our eternal position, this is our actual position."

      "transcript": "Everyone, every living being, we are eternally Krishna's servants or Krishna's devotees. Now, don't misunderstand the word servant. Servant means devotee. Devotee means devoted to serving Krishna out of love, that kind of servant, loving, devotional servant. And that's a very sweet relationship between each one of us and Krishna, eternal relationship. So, that is our actual position, and that is not a designation. That is what we are at the core of our heart. That's what we are. These material designations are external impositions on that eternal position. So that gets covered. I forget I am a devotee, and then I think in terms of the body or in terms of the social position in the society. So actually, even though I have accepted sannyas and people, they recognize me as a sannyasi, that's only for the sake of social interaction so that people understand that here is a sannyasi means here is a person whom I can approach for any spiritual guidance, any spiritual clarification, any spiritual knowledge without the sannyasi expecting anything in return, free of charge, without. Because sannyasi is renounced, he does not require anything. So, he will not charge you anything. He will not ask anything from you. His life is dedicated for simply disseminating this knowledge, this practice, this understanding, this important valuable lesson, this goal of life. That's why the dress. It's like a policeman performs his duty very nicely with a uniform. The policeman actually, as far as skill is concerned, his activity is concerned, he can do without uniform, but for people to be able to easily approach him for traffic guidance and in driving on the road. So, with a uniform, he can perform very easily his job. Similarly, a sannyasi with this uniform. Treat me with honor. No. Sanyasi, if he thinks like that, he's actually fallen. He's not qualified. He's not qualified. This is very important."
