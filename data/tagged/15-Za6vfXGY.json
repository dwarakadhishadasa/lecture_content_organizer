      "transcript": "How to control senses to focus on spiritual journey in time of crisis? Engaging the senses in devotional service means to engage the senses in devotional service, just like there is an example given in Bhagavad Gita of one Ambarish Maharaj. He was a pure devotee of Krishna, so he engaged all his senses in Krishna's service. As I said, beginning with the tongue, what do you do with the tongue to engage in Krishna's service? We chant Hare Krishna. Ears, we hear the chanting of Hare Krishna. With the tongue we can also taste Krishna Prasadam. With the eyes we can see the beautiful form of Krishna, either the picture of Krishna or the deity of Krishna. With the eyes we can read Bhagavad Gita. And then with the nose we can smell nice fragrant flowers offered to Krishna or incense offered to Krishna. With the sense of touch, you can engage in so many activities with the hands in Krishna's service. You can engage these hands and the sense of touch also. Like that, all the senses, if we engage in Krishna's service, that is the way to control."
