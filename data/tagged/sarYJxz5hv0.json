      "summary": "The speaker argues that Vedic knowledge, originating from Vyasadeva, doesn't require external scientific proof because it is inherently complete and consistent, unlike fields like mathematics.",

      "transcript": "The modern mind is so diseased, when we hear something, we immediately try to find a proof for it from the scientific field or some other field. We try to bring some arguments to prove this Vedic statement. No, that is not the proper way of understanding this Vedic knowledge. So, Vyasadeva, who is an incarnation of Krishna, he himself has given this knowledge. I came across one theorem in mathematics. It is called Godel's theorem of incompleteness. One mathematician proved that mathematics is not complete and consistent. So, mathematicians themselves proved that mathematics is incomplete. So, by holding on to the incomplete field, how can you learn conclusive truths? That's why such fields of approach to knowledge, they are compared to holding on to the dog's tail to cross the ocean of science, whereas Prabhupada's books and knowledge are complete and consistent. Now, you can see the value. Prabhupada says, \"These are not my books. These are written by Vyasadeva. This knowledge is coming from Vyasadeva.\" When any Vedic statement is made, that itself is an evidence. There is no need of any proof."
