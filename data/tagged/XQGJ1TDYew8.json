We cover many temples and ashrams, Raghunath's place, Srinivasacharya's place, and then we enter Vishnupur, but always circumambulating Navadvipa. Even when we go to Bangladesh, we are circumambulating Navadvipa on the right hand side, keeping Navadvipa on the right hand side."

      "transcript": "So we will just read, I have one or two paragraphs about Hrishikananda. So Hrishikananda Prabhu, the disciple of Shamananda Prabhu. Sri Hrishikananda Prabhu was born in 1590 in the village of Rayani, in the Medinipura district. His father's name was Raja Achuthananda, a rich zamindar, and his mother, Bhavani Devi. Medinapur district used to be part of Orissa kingdom. Hrishikananda was also known by the name Hrishikamurari. Hrishikamurari meets Shamananda Prabhu. One day, Hrishikamurari was meditating in a solitary place. He was anxious to find a spiritual master who could give him spiritual direction. He had entered into a very deep meditation when he heard a disembodied voice say, \"Murari, you need not be anxious any longer. Your guru is Shamananda Prabhu and you will meet him here very shortly. Take shelter of him and your life will be successful.\" Upon hearing this divine message, Murari began chanting the name of Shamananda on his beads with joyful enthusiasm. He spent the entire night crying out of his desire to meet his guru. At dawn, Hrishikamurari was on the lookout for his guru when he saw the tall figure of Shamananda approaching him, as effulgent as the sun, surrounded by his disciples. He started dancing and chanting the name of Lord Nityananda. Having waited anxiously for so long to encounter his guru, Hrishikamurari immediately fell at his feet. Shamananda affectionately lifted him up and embraced him and later initiated him with the Radha Krishna mantra."

      "transcript": "Hrishikamurari's Guru Shamananda was a great devotee of the Guru, fully committing himself in body, mind and soul, so much so that in a short time he was recognized as Shamananda's chief disciple and was a very powerful preacher. With the spiritual powers invested in him by his guru, Hrishikamurari was able to convert many criminals, atheists, Muslims and other fallen spirit souls to the path of devotion, bestowing the jewel of Prema upon them all. On one occasion, a wicked Muslim tried to silence Hrishikamurari by having him attacked by an intoxicated elephant, but Hrishikamurari was able to transform even the elephant into a disciple and engage him in the service of Vishnu and the Vaishnavas."
