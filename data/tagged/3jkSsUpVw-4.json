      "transcript": "Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha. So in the Purport, Srila Prabhupada says, according to the Pancharatra, this is one of the scriptures specifically connected with Bhakti or devotional service. So according to Pancharatra, Narayana is the primal cause of all expansions of Godhead. Now Krishna is there, the original personality, supreme personality of Godhead. He has got many expansions. Balarama is His expansion. Rama is His expansion. Parashurama is His expansion. Varaha is His expansion. Sankarsana is His expansion. Mahavishnu is His expansion, like that. So there are many, many expansions, actually unlimited expansions. But the Pancharatra describes Narayana, the form of the Lord, is the primeval cause of all expansions of Godhead. Now these are Vasudeva Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha. The four expansions are specifically mentioned in the Pancharatra: Vasudeva Sankarsana Pradyumna Aniruddha. Now these four expansions are described as Vasudeva and Sankarsana are on the middle left and right. Pradyumna is on the right of Sankarsana and Aniruddha is on the left of Vasudeva. And thus the four deities are described."

All Vedic mantras begin with Om. All Vedic mantras. So that Om is actually the Supreme Lord Krishna himself. That is explained in the Bhagavad Gita and all of the scriptures. Omkara is actually another form of Krishna Omni. The sound representation of Krishna. Thus the mantra is established by the transcendental chanting process namely Om, Namo, Dhimahi, etc."

      "transcript": "Any Vedic mantra begins with Om and it has got these words in the mantra in order to invoke the presence of the Lord through such chanting. The purport is, now what is the meaning of this whole thing that has been described in this particular verse? Any transaction either in the field of fruity work or in emperic philosophy, which is not ultimately aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord is considered to be useless. In the Vedas, there are so many recommendations in terms of doing fruity work. What is fruity work? Any work done which will give a result of some material benefit. And emperic philosophy is knowledge which will lead to realization of the Self. So whether in the field of karma or jnana, which is something which is not aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord, ultimately the goal should always be in every activity, even what is recommended in the scriptures or otherwise. The aim should be transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord. Only that is having a permanent benefit for the soul. Otherwise, any sort of material gain, it is simply a temporary benefit. It is not going to save us ultimately when we have to face the cataclysms of material nature, when we have to face death, or when we have to face pralaya, when we have to face some natural calamities, or when we have to face material miseries which are forced upon us, then all the material benefits are useless."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/3jkSsUpVw-4?t=514",
      "transcript": "So anything that we do should be aimed at transcendental realization of the Supreme Lord. Because by realizing the Supreme Lord, immediately we are elevated beyond the three gunas to the spiritual platform where there are no miseries, there are no natural calamities, there is no illusion, there is no effect of the illusory energy. So that is very, very important. It is very important to be noted. So Srila Prabhupada is further explaining here in the purport, Naradji has therefore explained the nature of unalloyed devotional service by his personal experience in the development of intimacy between the Lord and living entity. We should not forget, each one of us as spirit-soul, we have an intimate, loving relationship with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is already there. It is eternally there. It is not some new relationship we have to discover or establish. No. It is eternally there. It always exists. And therefore this is so important to understand that the nature of pure devotional service is that one can develop this intimacy of one's relationship with Krishna by a gradual process of progressive devotional activities. This is what Narad Muni has been explaining in the several verses which he is instructing to Vyasa Deva. Such a progressive march of transcendental devotion for the Lord culminates in the attainment of loving service of the Lord which is called Prema. That is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is teaching us: Krishna Prema."

And this Krishna Prema is to be experienced in different transcendental variegatedness called rasas or tastes. It is not something which is stereotyped, hackneyed, boring, dull kind of experience. No. It is full of variegatedness. Rich variegated experience of different rasas. It is a very elaborate subject, a subject matter of transcendental taste, mellow taste of devotional service. Such devotional service is also executed in mixed forms, namely mixed with fruity work or empirical philosophical speculation. So there is pure devotional service and there is mixed devotional service. What is the difference? So Srila Prabhupada says that we should aim for pure devotional service, and we should not be settled down for mixed devotional service."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/3jkSsUpVw-4?t=753",
      "transcript": "For example, it has been explained already earlier in the second chapter of this first canto, but I will just briefly mention. Just like somebody performs devotional service with the aim of getting some material gain. That material gain could be something very, very pious. It may not be something sinful. But still such material gain being the aim of performing devotional service, as recommended in the Bhagavatam, that will make it mixed devotional service. Or somebody performs devotional service with the aim of merging into the existence of the Supreme. These are called karma mishrita bhakti and jnana mishrita bhakti. These will never satisfy the soul. These will never be permanent. They are all temporary results. They may give some temporary satisfaction, some temporary happiness, some temporary effects may be there, but they will not be eternally lasting. We should always remember that as spirit souls, we are always looking for eternal happiness, full of knowledge and transcendental bliss. That's what we are looking for. We are hankering for that. That is our constitutional position. That's our natural position. But anything short of that is never going to be satisfying ultimately. So, Suta Goswami has already explained, savai pumsam paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokshaje ahaituki apratihata yayatma supraseedati. What can satisfy the soul completely? Only if devotional service is pure, unmixed with karma and jnana. Even Rupa Goswami's definition, Acharya's definition of pure devotional service is, jnana karmadi anavratam, devotional service which is free from the mixture of jnana and karma. So, such pure devotional service is being explained here. I'll stop here. Thank you very much."
