      "transcript": "Welcome to all of you on this occasion of Balaram Purnima, Balaram Jayanti. Balaram Jayanti comes always before Krishna Jayanti, and Balaram appeared as the elder brother of Krishna, elder brother of God. Then the elder brother should be the God. But no, our God is Krishna, the Supreme Personality of God. Sarvakarana Karanam. He is Raso Vaisaha. He is full of Rasa. His existence is full of Rasa, interactive enjoyment. Purpose of life is enjoyment, but we do not know how to enjoy because we try to catch all diaramas for enjoyment, and diaramas don't give enjoyment. Only real life gives enjoyment. So in the spiritual world, there is only enjoyment, Satchik, Ananda, eternity, knowledge, and bliss. This is the existence in the spiritual world. So to this material world, the Supreme Lord comes in different, different forms. In Goloka Vrindavan, where Krishna, the Supreme Lord, is always enjoying, He has his brother, elder brother, because he wanted an elder brother. Because he wanted an elder brother, who can become his elder brother? He wanted a friend. Who can be his friend? Only he himself can. So, the first expansion, the first incarnation in one sense, the first expansion is Balaram, Baladeva. So whenever a person says, Balaram is the true God of Liberation. So whenever Krishna appears, before that Balarama appears. Just like in the womb of Devaki also, Balarama appeared first, just before Krishna. However, it was considered as a miscarriage. Why? Because he was attracted by the womb of Rohini. Hence, Sankarsana, he took birth as Rohini Nandan rather than Devaki Nandan. Krishna is Devaki Nandan, Krishna is Ashodan Nandan. Balarama is Rohini Nandan, another wife of Vasudeva. But he appears. Why does he appear? Because unless he comes and purifies, Krishna cannot come there. Only when Balarama comes and purifies, then the seat is worth to invite Krishna. So, even in our heart, unless Balarama appears first, Krishna cannot come. And in Chaitanya Leela, Krishna appeared as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Balarama appeared as Nithyananda Prabhu. So, if you want to get the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, we have to get the mercy of Nithyananda, who is Balarama. All the paraphernalia we use to worship Krishna is Balarama. All the pots, all the aarati, all the items we use to worship Krishna, because no material things can be used to worship Krishna."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/OcQ46N3pDaM?t=244",
      "transcript": "God cannot accept anything material. He can only accept anything spiritual, and only Balarama can spiritualize things. So, Pujaris, before they worship, they spiritualize everything with the Pancharatra mantras and come to the level of Krishna's spirituality to worship him with all the spiritual things, which represents Balarama. His bedding is Balarama. His pillow is Balarama. Burdanga is Balarama. Kartal is Balarama. So, for a devotee, everything is to be respectfully used. The asana, the vigraha, all the asanas you make for the Supreme Lord, the altar you make for the Supreme Lord, that is also Sankarsana. So, the Lord, Lord Vishnu only sleeps on Sankarsana. You can provide him any pillow, goose chest pillow, he will not accept. He will only lie down on Sankarsana. So, Sankarsana, Balarama, is the most important personality in all of our spiritual life because with his blessing, with his mercy, we can get Krishna. We can know Krishna. So, the person who takes us to Krishna, that is Guru. Hence, Balarama is Adiguru Nithyananda. He is Adiguru. Unless we get the blessing of Guru, Shri Guru, we cannot get the Supreme Lord. So, and Guru, what is Guru? Guru is a mercy incarnation of the Supreme Lord. Hence, Balarama is a merciful incarnation of Krishna who shows the way. So, Balarama also gives Bala, not bodybuilding Bala, but spiritual Bala, because we need spiritual Bala to get Krishna, not physical Bala. Physical Bala will help you to do Krishna Seva better, but won't give Krishna."

      "transcript": "That Bala comes from Balarama. So, in Vrindavan, Krishna and Balarama, even though Balarama is elder to Krishna, he will only say yes to Krishna, anything he wants. In the house, if our elder brothers stay like this, we will not be able to get Krishna. If our elder brothers stay like this, how good it could have been. But elder brothers are not like that. But Balarama, the elder brother, his only wish is to satisfy Krishna, because he was also put into confusion at the time of Mahabharata Yuta, which side will Krishna have into Pandavas. I like Duryodhana, but I can't fight against Krishna. So, he went for Tirta Yatra. So, he never does anything against the Vishnu of Krishna. In Dwaraka, he protects Dwaraka. He and him and Krita Verma, under him, the entire Narayaniya, Vanakshahuni soldiers, army of Balarama. The entire army was given to Kauravas, under Krita Verma. That's all the complexities of warfare. But Balarama always wants the satisfaction of his younger brother. And Krishna also does not like to be called Krishna. See Krishna, not very happy. You call him Balabhadra Anuja, he is very happy. Krishna Purvaja, that is Balarama. You call him Partha Sarathi, he is happy. You call him Rukmini, Rukripyatma, he is happy. You call him Devaki Nandan, he is happy. Krishna is happy. So, the Lord always wants to associate with the relationship, and that is our Swaroopa, relationship with the Lord. It is not that God is a big boss and we are all servants like in the material world, no. Yes, we are servants, but we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. And as a part of Him, we too enjoy in His association. Just like the spark is always full of bliss. When the spark is in the fire, as soon as the spark gets out of the fire, it dies away. In the same way, we, the spiritual spark, Amsha of the Supreme Lord Krishna, we too are satisfied only when that connection with Krishna comes back."

Hence, in the Bhagavata Sampradaya, Gaudiya Sampradaya, the Vaishnava Sampradaya, which we follow, Balarama is very important, more important than Krishna. Just like Guru is more important than the Lord. So Balarama's mercy is most important, and He always sees that only those purified souls get relationship with the Supreme Lord. So for our spiritual purification, He plays a very important role. In the Hare Krishna Mahamantra also, there are three levels of chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. The second level is Krishna and Balarama. Sopa says Balarama provides the strength, and not only strength, Rama also means pleasure potency. So the spiritual pleasure, spiritual bliss, spiritual strength is given by Balarama. Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Rama. And the final stage is Radha Krishna. Rama means Radha Krishna. Jubala Jodi. So he plays a very important role in the purification of the spirit soul in receiving Krishna's mercy. That is the final goal, to receive Krishna. That is not possible unless Balarama is satisfied."

      "transcript": "So in the material world, He expands in different forms. He expands as Ananda Sesha in the coastal ocean. Ananda Sesha as Garbhodaka ocean. Ananda Sesha in the Svetadvipa. The same way, if the Lord has to come in our heart, He has to create Sankarsana Consciousness. And what is Sankarsana Consciousness? Nothing but absolute spiritual consciousness, Akhanda Brahman. So with spiritual knowledge, the equality, spiritual equality that comes in a Sadaka before Sri Sri Radha Krishna appears in his heart. So Balarama, as we know, in Vrindavan, in Dwaraka, everywhere, he has taken this subservient role to the Supreme Personality of God. So Krishna, this Krishna Consciousness movement is a movement which is very very personal and very very relationship oriented. Hence, for us, Guru, Krishna, Vaishnavas, they all become very important part in our spiritual life."

Spiritual knowledge comes from Seva, purifying the senses by doing Seva. That is why Krishna Seva is given so much importance. Rishikena, Rishikesha, Saivana, Bhakti Rucha. Rishikena, Rishikesha, Rishikesha, is Supreme Lord Krishna. Rishika is the senses. So when the senses are utilized in serving the Supreme Lord, Rishikesha, then the senses get purified. When the senses get purified, mind gets purified. Intelligence gets purified. The entire existence becomes purified. In that purified existence, chanting Hare Krishna, that makes a connection with the Supreme Lord. It's always Seva. That is why Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada, our Acharya, made these temples of all over the world. He said these are the places, these are all spiritual hubs where you can come and purify. So purification happens in this place. So that is why here in, near Ananagar, he opened this branch. Small place, but any Seva done here with pure mind reaches the Supreme, Goloka Vrindavan. There is no difference between where it is. You may have some, you may have some inconveniences here, but if you do Seva humbly to satisfy Guru and Krishna, it reaches. And Balaram notices that."

So, Balaram, represented here by the spiritual master, they are all watching because the whole idea of spiritual master, Balaram, is to see that the living entities get liberation from this material world. Why should we get liberated from the material world? Because this is not a good place to be in. If you want to know this is not a good place to be in, you should have some negative experiences in this material world. Otherwise, you think this material world is very nice. Like, there is a story. The Western world. Tell a meat eater, Westerner who is meat eater, all kinds of sin he does. He says, don't do sin. Why? I feel good doing all these things. Smoking, meat eating, humanizing, intoxicating. I know good. I feel this enjoyment. No, you will go to hell. No, my family, everybody does this. All of them will go to hell. Oh, then hell is a good place. I will go to hell. All my family members are there. So, if you do not know what is good and what is bad, you will think this is the right enjoyment, but this is not the right enjoyment. We can hear from the Shastras that Krishna himself declares Dukhalayam Asasratam. Don't try to be happy in this world. This is Dukhalayam."

So, this is called third-class intelligence. You taste this dirty world as good. Second-class intelligence means that you know what is good and what is bad. So, you know what is good and what is bad. So, second-class intelligence is when you get a beating, this place is not good. Let us go back and see what is good. And first-class intelligence is when you hear from the spiritual master, when you hear from the sastras, you already experience yes, material world is not good. Why? Because material world cannot give you permanent happiness, and we all want happiness. Everybody wants a house. Everybody wants a job. Everybody wants a job. Everybody wants a vehicle. Everybody wants a fridge. Everybody wants a TV. Everybody wants a flat. Why? To be happy. But are you happy? No. Why? Because once you get one thing, then there are ten problems connected to that. I want mobile phone, iPhone, earphone, Apple phone, orange phone. But no connectivity. Your house is in a guha. There is no connection. What is this? So, for every desire, there are ten obstructions in this material world. How much can we enjoy with our senses? How much can you eat? So, there is limitation in this material world, but the soul is unlimited. The soul is not to be limited by all these temporary things. So, to free the soul, layer by layer, we need to purify"

But Baladeva, Balarama, Purnima is one of the very important functions. So we are here today celebrating that. May the Lord bless all of us to get his mercy, to go back to Supreme Lord Krishna."
