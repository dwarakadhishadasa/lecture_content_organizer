Then you will see how we should be towards, how our attitude should be towards the general population chanting Hare Krishna. This is Bhaktivinoda Thakur's Sharanagati, quoted from Adi Purana. It's called, chant anyway. It starts like this: Your mind is wandering all over the universe when you chant. Chant anyway. Your mind is wandering to the past and future when you chant. Chant anyway. You are not able to concentrate on Krishna's names while you chant. Chant anyway. You have no taste for chanting. Chant anyway. You have lusty desires. Chant anyway. You are making offenses in chanting. Chant anyway."

      "transcript": "You are not praying to Krishna to help you chant better. Chant anyway. You often chant late at night. Chant anyway. And why, why should you chant despite all the above obstacles? That is why. What is that? There is no vow like chanting the Holy Name. There's no knowledge superior to it. There is no meditation which comes anywhere near it, and it gives the highest result. No penance is equal to it, and nothing is as potent or powerful as the holy name. Chanting is the greatest act of piety and the supreme refuge. Even the words of Vedas do not possess sufficient power to describe its magnitude. It's continuing. Chanting is the highest path to liberation, peace, and eternal life. It's a pinnacle of devotion, heart's joyous proclivity and attraction. See, it's a heart's joyous proclivity and attraction and the best form of remembrance of the Supreme Lord."

It's not required, right? Even to an uneducated person, you can always teach him how to concurrently chant and hear. Done, done."

It also does not need any education. So to do soulful japa, you have to be a human being, that's all. You don't need very big education. So much we need to discuss today to do soulful japa, because we have become very complicated. To reduce the complication, we have to tell all these things that might go the way anywhere, at least you catch, know where is your Asha, where is your Ichcha, you identify it's going on, and you have to offer all those things here."
