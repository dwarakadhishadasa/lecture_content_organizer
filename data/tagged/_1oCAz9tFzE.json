Prabhupada writes, \"Consciousness as a symptom of the soul.\" These two statements look contradictory."

Electricity is driving this fan, electricity is driving this light. Cut off the electricity, everything seems to be there. Yes, the unseen is gone, okay. But I should not mistake electricity with the electrical wire. Electricity is not equal to the bulb, electricity is not equal to the light. A dead electrical wire and a live electrical wire, an electrified wire, is not equal to electricity. Electricity is flowing inside. Therefore, it is alive.

Similarly, gross body and subtle body, manas, buddhi, ahankara, they are like electrical wire. Then the soul is connected to that. Then electricity is connected to the wire. So, this is the kshetra. This is the kshetra. Then you have the soul. The soul is connected to this kshetra, this body, gross body and subtle body, the symptom of life comes. But the symptom of life is not there if you take it away. A dead man has no symptom of life. So the symptom of life is coming from spirit. But in this world, it is manifest differently. This is the same for the kshetra. The kshetra, it is very different from the earth. A 100-watt bulb will give 100-watt light, a 20-watt will give 20-watt light. So you will mistake that the bulb is a giver of 20 watts. This bulb gives 20 watts, that bulb gives 20 watts, no.

Matter cannot think without the spirit. Manas buddhi ahankara is not manas buddhi ahankara. I'll give you an example of ego. Pure white light is there, it's a little example. You put a lion mask in front of it, transparent, translucent. You go the other side. It's transparent. You go the other side. It's transparent. Translucent. Translucent.

Similarly, we are playing so many false egos. I am this body, everything. Who is this? It is all the soul is doing, but influenced by the material energy. Now we are trying to create pure influence.
