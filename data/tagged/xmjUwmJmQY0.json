Hanuman is considered very powerful, intelligent, courageous, smart, they like to become a servant leader. Hanuman is considered very powerful, intelligent, courageous, smart, they like to become a servant leader. Hanuman is considered very powerful, intelligent. Because Hanuman stood for dharma and nyaya. Whenever there was injustice done to anyone, Hanuman was there to deliver justice. Example is Sugriv. Sugriv was actually attacked by his own brother, Vali. And Sugriv was thrown out of his own kingdom, Kishkindha. He was wronged. So Hanuman supported Sugriv. He supported weak people. This is the quality of those who are powerful. A power is always used in the service of the weak people. In that way, Hanuman was in the side of Sugriv. When Hanuman came to know about Lord Shriram, whose wife was kidnapped, that means there was injustice done to Lord Shriram by Ravana. Immediately Hanuman came to do saviour. To deliver justice to Shriram, Hanuman also worked very hard to bring justice to distressed women like Mother Sita. Sita was put into a very, very distressful condition by Ravana and Hanuman fought with great valour to give justice to Mother Sita. So Hanuman is popular and worshipped because throughout his life, he used his power, his intelligence, his courage in the service of Dharma, in the service of Nyaya,"

He became the servant of a glorious leader like Shriram. In Ramayana, we also see Ravana, who is also powerful. Ravan also had many powerful, intelligent servants but nobody is remembered today. They all gave up their lives serving Ravan but nobody is worshipped and nobody, we don't even know their names because they were all on the side of adharma and the side of anyai. Anybody who takes the side of adharma and anyai, they will be dead and they will be forgotten. Even in the modern history, there are many so-called powerful people like Napoleon, like Hitler. Do we even remember them or their followers? No, we don't even know who are their followers. But Hanuman, from thousands of years, people remember, glorify, worship him"

Even though Hanuman did so much service to Lord Shri Ram, did he ever ask anything in return? When I become servant of somebody, I am always thinking what is the profit of doing so much of service? What did I get in return? What is the reward that Hanuman received? Hanuman received nothing in return. He received the love of Shri Ram. So here is a selfless person. For whom, the service to dharma, service to nyaya itself is a reward. So I think we all have an inherent attraction to such people who stand up for dharma, who stand up for nyaya selflessly, not for any reward. So Hanuman is that example who selflessly fought for nyaya and dharma for Shri Ram and he remained very happy and satisfied, servant of Shri Ram. So he teaches an example how to become a servant leader. He is a good servant of Shri Ram and he is a good leader for all of us to follow."
