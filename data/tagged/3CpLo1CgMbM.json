      "transcript": "Reading from Srimad Bhagavatam, first canto, 19th chapter, 24th verse, appearance of Shukadev Goswami. Translation, O trustworthy brahmanas, I now ask you about my immediate duty. Please, after proper deliberation, tell me of the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances and specifically of those who are just about to die. Purport, in this verse, the king has placed two questions before the learned sages. The first question is, what is the duty of everyone in all circumstances? And the second question is, what is the specific duty of one who is to die very shortly? Out of the two, the question relating to the dying man is most important, because everyone is a dying man, either very shortly or after 100 years. The duration of life is immaterial, but the duty of a dying man is very important. Maharaj Pariksit placed these two questions before Shukadev Goswami also on his arrival. And practically the whole of Srimad Bhagavatam, beginning from the second canto up to the last 12th canto, deals with these two questions. The conclusion arrived at thereof is that, devotional service of Lord Srikrishna, as it is confirmed by Lord himself in the last phases of the Bhagavad Gita, is the last word in relation to everyone's permanent duty in life. Maharaj Pariksit was already aware of this fact, but he wanted the great sages assembled there to unanimously give their verdict on his conviction, so that he might be able to go on with his confirmed duty without controversy."

      "transcript": "He has specifically mentioned the word Shuddha or perfectly correct. For transcendental realization or self-realization, many processes are recommended by various classes of philosophers. Some of them are first class methods and some of them are second or third class methods. The first class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender unto the lotus feet of Lord and thus be saved from all sins and their reactions. So in this verse, Parikshit Maharaj is asking something very important to all the sages who have assembled there in the forest of Naimisharanya. He has just been cursed by the son of the Rishi, Sringi, that boy. And the curse is that he is supposed to die in seven days. He receives a death notice, something very unique, Prabhupada writes. And he is asking two very, very important questions. Prabhupada writes that the quality of question itself is so wonderful. Just the question itself is so wonderful. What are the two questions he is asking? Number one, what is the ultimate duty, the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances? Not just what is my duty, his duty. Everyone's duty, unalloyed duty, the highest duty in all circumstances. It's like everything is covered in this. And then the second question that he is asking is, and the duty of someone who is about to die immediately. These are the two questions and Prabhupada writes in the purport, the entire Srimad Bhagavatam is based out of these two questions. Right from the second canto, this is the 19th chapter of the first canto. The first canto is ending now. And now the second canto to 12th canto is all based on these two questions."

      "transcript": "So Prabhupada writes, Who is not a dying man? Everyone is a dying man. We cannot say, generally people think dying means old age. But no, we cannot be so sure when death will come. Death may come any moment. There is no guarantee. And in that way, Prabhupada says, everyone is a dying man. There was one of my neighbors, we stayed in Calcutta for about 20 years. And one Mr. Mittal Ji, we shared the same floor. We were next door neighbors. We used to spend time there. They used to spend time there. I knew them very well. So just not long time ago, but very recently I got a news about him that he passed away. It was very shocking how he passed away. He was a very hale and healthy man, very nice person, very gentle. And he had built a new house and he was supposed to be doing Griha Pravesha. There was so much of excitement and happiness in the entire family. He has three children and the pujas were supposed to begin. And he was supposed to go, the Pandit Ji told him that can you please go and bring some puja items for the puja. Something was missing or something like that. So he went to bring some puja items from the market and then family members are waiting for him to come back. And he is not returning. And then after a while it was a matter of concern what happened. And then somehow they got a call after some time that he is, who is this and he is your father and he is on the road and please come. He looks like something has happened. Please come and they were all shocked and they rushed to the place from where the call came. And what had happened actually, he was carrying the puja items or something like that. He was walking and he was going and one vehicle came and hit him. It was not a very big hit, it was a small hit. And he fell down, the way he fell down something on his brain got hurt. And he was rushed to the hospital. And the doctor says 24 hours is very critical. We cannot say anything like that. But as Krishna had desired after 24 hours he passed away. This news came as a big shock. Imagine the excitement, griha pravesha, new house, new apartment. And this is what happened and nobody had any idea about it."

      "transcript": "So every moment we must remind ourselves that we have a very important duty. And I must complete that duty before I die. Just yesterday it happened. We were all travelling to Haridas Thakur's birthplace and we were in the first vehicle. Ten of us were there. And just we were driving, the driver was driving, it was at a medium speed. And just about 15-20 meters ahead of us one big tree branch just fell on the road. It was like first time live we saw it. It got captured on the video. And it was a fraction of 3-4 seconds. If we were 3-4 seconds ahead. It was a huge one. It occupied the entire expanse of the road. It just fell. It was some old tree or something like that. And see how Krishna saved us. So this verse is actually talking about how seriously we must take to devotional service. What is the unalloyed duty of everyone in all circumstances. The question itself is so serious. I must become Krishna conscious very soon, very quickly. Because unless and until you become perfectly Krishna conscious, we have not actually done our duty."

And what is the second line? Patita pavan hetu tavey avataar. Mosama patita Prabhu na paiy beyaar. So we sing this every day. And then we say, we offer a prayer to Krishna, that Krishna, I am the most fallen. And since I am the most fallen, my claim is first on being delivered. Please claim me. I am the most fitting candidate for being delivered. And then your name as Patita, your name as Patita Pavana will be truly glorified. We pray like that. Prabhupada in one place writes something more than this. Yes, we can pray. Definitely we should pray that I am the most fallen so my claim is first. But then in what should be a mood and what should be a consciousness of praying and a practice of devotional service. So Prabhupada quotes these two lines and then soon after that he writes, But one must be very serious and sincere. It is not that yes, it is good to pray that I am the most fallen and so please deliver me first. But we should be very sincere, very serious and then Krishna will deliver us from, He will purify us from all contamination surely and certainly. So actually if we read Srila Prabhupada's books, we will get this sense. This sense should be absorbed from Srila Prabhupada. Prabhupada's life itself, he is a living example of how serious and sincere he was. Writing books, midnight, 12 o'clock, getting up at 4 o'clock. You see the seriousness and how serious Prabhupada was in spreading Krishna consciousness. With just 40 rupees, he is trying, he is struggling, he is endeavouring. And all over his lectures, all over his books, He gives this impression to us that we must be very serious and sincere."

So this is one line which talks and like this you can find innumerable lines. We practice devotional service as practice of devotional service is the means to attain perfection. So there are three words here. Practice of devotional service is the means to attain perfection. Now for each of these three words, one more word has been added. We must practice intensive devotional service, not just devotional service. And intensive devotional service is the only means to attain final perfection in Krishna consciousness. So look at the word. Intensive devotional service is the only means for final perfection of Krishna consciousness. So we all have to go for the final perfection. Even if we are 99.9% Krishna conscious, there is no going back to Godhead. We have to be 100% Krishna conscious."

So and actually there are many verses. And one more place. So this is one verse where he is talking about. Tasmad Bharata Sarvatma. Bhagwan Ishwaro Harihi. Sarvatma. Everyone. Bhagwan Ishwaro Harihi. And what they should do? Hear, chant, remember, worship. And in another place Shukadev Goswami is saying. Tasmad ekina manasa. Bhagwan Satvatam Patihi. Shotavya. Kirti Tavyasya. Gheya. Pujas. Cha. Nityadhar. Ekina manasa. Ekina manasa means with one pointed attention. Another way. A perfect reply for a perfect question. One should, Shotavya, Kirti Tavyasya, hear, chant, Gheya, remember, Pujas, worship, Cha, Nityadhar, Nityadhar means constantly. So devotees should actually reflect on all these things, that am I doing my devotional service with this intensity, with this force. In another place Prabhupada is right. We should not be doing devotional service casually, but we should be doing devotional service seriously, constantly. So this Govarmandal Parikshan, Parikrama that we are all out, it's an opportunity for us during these 20 days to actually engage in this intensive practice of devotional service, because Ekina manasa. It is very, it is sometimes, because we are not, we are still conditioned. We are not on that stage where we can practice this 24 hours. But at least these 20 days that we have, we should take this opportunity, remember these instructions and make the best use of this opportunity that is there. I must at least for these days, Shotavya, Kirti Tavya, Shadheyya, Poojas, Cha Nityada, Ekina Manasa. All these things can be practiced."

So before we get into this mood, first a desire should be there and a prayer, a heartfelt prayer should be there, that yes Prabhupada I want to do like this. I am unable to do like this and please help me. And so when Prabhupada sees that a devotee is very sincere and very eager in becoming like that, we will be blessed with this opportunity. So like yesterday we were there in such a wonderful place, Haridas Thakur Samadhi and sorry, Bhajan Kotir and the appearance place. And we saw that tree also. It was so much different. So it all, all these, this is a very one, I am realizing now after coming here. You know that what a wonderful, we have read. So all these pastimes in CC and different places of Prabhupada. But when you come here and you be in that place, I am sure all of you have this experience. Some of you shared also. It is so much different from just reading. It is giving us, this intensive practice of devotional service actually comes so easily. So we should be grateful to Prabhupada, be grateful to all the devotees who have you know organized this, because so nicely it is coming, so easily it is coming."

Later she became Lakshahira. A small pastime which I heard something about Lakshahira. So Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he would, devotees would invite Chaitanya Mahaprabhu for the, for lunch. That was a, that was a system, that 12 o'clock, the noon time lunch, Mahaprabhu would take in the house of devotees. And all the devotees, he was very eager to host Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to, because that was a devotional service and they wanted to do that. And Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he realized that he is receiving too many invitations. So every day you can accept only one invitation. But there were so many devotees of Lord Chaitanya that every day he was receiving 3 to 4 invitations. So Mahaprabhu had to devise a method by which, you know, it is reduced to just one invitation. So he says from today I am going to accept invitations from only those devotees who are Lakshishwar. Lakshishwar. Lakshishwar means, it is something synonymous to, in Calcutta, Lakpati. Lakpati. It was a very well known term. This is about 30 years back. Lakpati means, now a days it is all crorepati. Lakpati is gone. Millionaire. So, Lakpati means, you possess a lakh of rupees. You can imagine what a Laksh, Lakpati would be during Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's time. But there were, Hiranya and Gordhan Majundar were there like that. So, so, Mahaprabhu says, from today I am going to accept invitations only from these people. So everybody thought, oh my god, Lakpati. None of them were Lakpati. They were all very simple devotees. Kola, Vicha, Shridhara, you know what he was. So they thought that, okay, from today then we can't host Mahaprabhu because that is the condition that he has placed. And then Mahaprabhu said something. He was actually basically trying to impress upon, stress upon, intensive devotional service. He said, no, Lakshishwar means, Ishwar means a lord of one lakh, not one lakh rupees. You should be possessing, not one lakh rupees, you should be possessing one lakh holy names every day."

You chant them all in one go, because that is good rounds. Ok. If you chant, if you chant the rounds, here one here two there three there, by the time it is evening, you just want to chew them up. If we can chant all rounds, all together 16 rounds, the whole day will be a complete different day. I have also realized this and I am sure many devotees would have also realized this.
