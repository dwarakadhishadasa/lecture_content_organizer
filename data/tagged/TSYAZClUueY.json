He himself takes pleasure and he also enlivens all the distressed souls of this universe.

But simply take to the process of bhakti, especially hearing the glories of Krishna from such pure devotees as Narada, Vyasa, Srila Narad Muni, Sita Goswami, Sita Chandra, Srila Prabhupada. Your life is going to be a complete success, ultimate success. So how does it actually happen? In the previous session I was discussing about devotional service. That one may not attain devotional perfection even after following all the rules and regulations of devotional service, or one may get it, you know, very easily, very quickly. So it all depends on the mercy of the supreme lord coming through the transparent medium of the bona fide spiritual master. What's the meaning of this transparent medium? We discussed this earlier. The spiritual master facilitates lord's mercy to be distributed to the suffering souls for the benefit of the suffering souls. But in distributing like this, this mercy of the supreme lord to the suffering souls, the spiritual master engages in what is called as devotional activity"

Lord is not obligated to bestow devotional service upon anyone and everyone, and yet the scriptures say even though the lord is fully independent, he is also very, very kind to the suffering souls of this world. So therefore it is his only anxiety that my beloved part and parcels are suffering in this world under illusion, so he wants to rescue, but not against our wish. The pivot of all devotional activities is freedom. You are free to accept the path of devotional service, you're free to reject it or to not accept that at all. But you should understand other than devotional service there's no way"

There are so many examples in the Bhagavata and Bhagavad-Gita systematically explains the principles by which devotional service works. So here Srila Prabhupada says a very important thing: without freedom there is no execution of devotional service. The freedom surrender to the Lord, it is advice in the Bhagavad-Gita. Krishna advises us, surrender your so called illusory freedom. We don't have real freedom in this material world, we have illusory freedom. So Krishna says surrender that to whom? To Krishna. That does not mean that by surrendering we become slaves. No, by surrendering to the lord we become completely free. We become free from material bondage, we attain ultimate liberation, we attract the mercy of the supreme lord."

So in the purport to this last verse, Srila Prabhupada explains, in the purport itself, Sri Narad Muni plays on his instrument to glorify the transcendental activities of the Lord. There's a song written by one of our, the veena which Narad Muni carries is completely transcendental. It's of the same spiritual quality as the supreme lord, pure devotees, the spiritual world, etc. So the sound vibrated by this veena is completely spiritual. So what is the proof that it is spiritual? Narad Muni vibrates for place on this instrument called veena and by doing so he simply sings the glories of the supreme lord. Not only Narad Muni playing on the veena instrument glorifies the supreme lord, but he also does give relief to all miserable lives. He glorifies the supreme lord and he coaches the glory of the lord"

And he enlivens others by simply glorifying the Lord while playing on his instrument, the Veena. So Prabhupada says in this purport, no one is happy here within the universe. And what is felt as happiness is Maya's illusion. This I explained in the previous session. The same thing is repeated, that only under the influence of illusion, due to illusory presentation called happiness, a person thinks himself or herself happy. But nobody is happy. Nobody. Nobody is really happy, because the quality of this material happiness is illusory. That's why. The illusory energies of the Lord is so strong that even the hog who lives on filthy stool feels happy. What kind of happiness is this, this material happiness? The hog is eating some rubbish, and the hog feels very, very happy eating such rubbish. We think it is very abominable. So whole material existence is like that. So Srila Prabhupada says, no one can be truly happy within the material world."

Or they get something which is limited, and it's not satisfying the core of the heart, the spirit soul. Then they attempt to get some other similar happiness in another way, another attempt, another background, another technique. But actually, Prabhupada's statement here is, no one can be truly happy within the material world. No one can be truly happy. And you can talk to any number of materialistic persons. If they're honest with you, they will admit that whatever pleasure they are seeking, that is simply some material happiness, which is illusory. And they will not easily admit, but that confide that such material happiness is not at all the same as the pleasure derived from devotional cells. It's totally different in quality."
