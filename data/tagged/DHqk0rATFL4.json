That has been summarized in 4 verses, just 4 verses. So these 4 verses are very, very, very, very, very important. You can understand the whole of Bhagavatam just by studying these 4 verses. So for these verses, Srila Prabhupada has written very, very elaborate purports. And these 4 verses bring out the essence of the philosophy of the Bhagavatam. Bhagavatam is presenting the philosophy of God. So that philosophy has been very nicely explained in these 4 verses. So which are those 4 verses? They are the verses beginning with the 2nd canto 9th chapter 33rd verse up to 36th verse: 33, 34, 35, and 36. So these 4 verses we'll spend more time on than on the other verses. We have already begun this verse in the last class. So I will continue with this same verse this class, and probably it will go on for a few more classes. So we are reciting the 33rd verse of the 2nd canto 9th chapter."

      "transcript": "Now a certain background for this verse is that the Srimad Bhagavatam is the last work of Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva compiled the Vedic literature as we have it today. Because before Vyasa Deva compiled the Vedic literature, what was available was only in the form of Shruti. The Vedas were available as that which was heard and passed on through oral tradition. Oral tradition means the Guru will speak, the disciple will hear, and as soon as the disciple hears, he will commit to memory. Just he hears once and he commits to memory and he is able to remember the rest of the verse. And after hearing from the Guru and committing to memory, the disciple will try to understand the meaning of what is heard from the Guru, and then he will deliberate on the meaning and ask questions from the Guru and try to understand and realize this subject matter of the Vedas. This is called Shrutapantha: understanding, learning, understanding, and realizing through hearing."

      "transcript": "Now in the beginning of Kali Yuga, Vyasa Deva appeared for a very specific reason. He could see that in Kali Yuga, people's memory will be very short-lived. Their lifespan also will be reduced. In Kali Yuga, people's duration of life is shortened. So the Bhagavatam explains, in Sakya Yuga, the duration of life was 100,000 years, 1 lakh years. And that duration of life reduced in Treta Yuga, the next Yuga, to 10,000 years. Further reduced in the next Yuga, called Dwapar Yuga, to 1,000 years. And in Kali Yuga, the last of the four Yugas, in the cycle of four Yugas, the last Yuga, Kali Yuga, it is further reduced to 100 years. So the duration of life being reduced, the time available for studying the Vedas is also very less. Not only that, people's memory has also become less. In Kali Yuga, duration of life, memory, and so many other such good qualities are reduced."

It is a title which indicates that one who records, one who puts down in writing and creates a record, Vyasa is a title. Actually, the Vyasa title is given to the incarnation of the Lord who appeared at the end of Dwapar Yuga, Krishna Dwaipaayana Vyasa. His full name is Krishna Dwaipaayana Vyasa. He is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord who has appeared for a very special purpose. The first of the reasons is that he put down the Vedas in writing. He put down the Vedas in writing. Then also, he saw that the Vedas are very, very vast. Even if the written Vedas are available for people, still he decided to divide the one Veda into four. What did he do? He divided the one Veda into four. And that is how we have the four divisions of the Vedas called Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda."

Thereby, people can take up only the portion that is relevant for them and learn and study only that portion. So Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda, he divided the one Veda into four. But even that, one fourth of the entire Vedas that he divided was also very, very big. It was not small. So he further summarized each of those four divisions of Vedas into what is called as Upanishads. Vedas contain many different details called Brahmana, Aranyaka, Samhita, and Upanishads. All these different sections of the Vedas, for each of the Vedas, Rig Veda has its own Brahmana, Aranyaka, Samhita, and Upanishads. Yajur Veda has its own Brahmana, Aranyaka, Samhita, and Upanishads. Similarly, Sama Veda and Atharva Veda. So the Upanishad portion of each of the Vedas contains the essence of the philosophy of the Vedic knowledge. The Upanishad portion contains the philosophy, and it is also in the form of the essence of the philosophy. So the Upanishads also are many. There are 108 principal Upanishads. How many?"

So even those 108 Upanishads, in Kali Yuga, people will not be able to study. 108 Upanishads. Very big number. So what did Vyasa Deva do? He further summarized all the Upanishads into what is called as Vedanta Sutra. The summary of the summary. The cream of the cream. Just like you boil milk, you get cream. But that cream, if you further condense, cream of the cream, further you condense, you get the real, real, real essence. That cream of the cream is called Vedanta Sutra. Upanishads are also called Vedanta. Vedanta means the conclusion of the Vedas, of the essence of the Vedas. Now essence of the Vedas as Upanishads or Vedanta is very big. Even though it is distant and made small, but still that is also not sufficiently summarized. That's what Vyasa Deva could foresee. So he further condensed the Vedanta or Upanishads into Vedanta Sutra. And that Vedanta Sutra is just some thousand short sutras, aphorisms. Sutra means like a formula. These aphorisms are very, very short and very terse. Athako brahma jinyasa is one Vedanta Sutra. Like this there are 1055 short sutras. That's what entire Vedic knowledge is summarized into this Vedanta Sutra. It's one small book. That's all. The whole Vedas, entirety of Vedas in one small book Vyasa Deva has summarized. This is the genius of Vyasa Deva."

Now in summarizing the entire Vedas into this Vedanta Sutra, Vyasa Deva could also see that this summarization will not be understood properly by majority of the people. Most people cannot understand because it's very much condensed, very terse, very difficult to understand. So what he did, he first of all compiled the itihasas and puranas in order to explain the Vedic message in an easily understandable way for the common people. So itihasas and puranas. Itihasas are historical narrations, which contain some important historical incidents, but which explain through the historical incidents the Vedic message. For example, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata. These are two important itihasas. Ramayana explains or describes the life of Lord Rama. Mahabharata explains the life of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. So these two itihasas are explaining the Vedic message in the form, but presented in the form of a nice story,"

      "transcript": "historical narration. Now this is story, the story of Lord Rama, the story of the Pandavas. Now these stories are not imaginary, fictitious stories, just like you have Jataka tales, Aesop's fables, fairy tales. These are not like that. These itihasas, even though they are presented as stories, they are not fictitious, imaginary, concocted stories. No. They are real stories, real incidents, historical incidents. Valmiki, a great sage, he wrote the Ramayana and Vyasadeva himself, who compiled the Vedic literature, he wrote the Mahabharata. So these are two important itihasas. Now in addition to the itihasas, there are other historical narrations called the Puranas. Now Puranas are very, very, very, very ancient historical narrations. In the itihasas, it's a definite narration of a particular set of incidents in the history. There's a time of Lord Rama, Treta Yuga, Rama appeared. So that life of Lord Rama is described in the Ramayana. Or the Pandavas and Kauravas, they were living in the Dvapara Yuga, before this Kali Yuga began. So that narration is concerning that period of time, Pandavas and Kauravas. But the Puranas are little different than the itihasas. What do the Puranas contain? The Puranas contain very, very, very ancient historical narrations that go back even to the beginning of creation, or even before the creation. And Puranas also contain stories, historical narrations, but these stories are real. They are again not fabricated stories. They are real incidents, historical incidents, but they could be very, very, very old."

      "transcript": "And one more characteristic of the Puranas is that in the Puranas there are definite topics which are described concerning the philosophy of the Vedas. Just like Bhagavata Purana, it has ten topics. It describes the creation, the secondary creation, the planetary systems, the science of God, the maintenance of this material world, the destruction. All these topics are discussed systematically in the Bhagavata Purana. There are other categories of Puranas in which there are only five topics discussed. They are called Upapuranas. So there are Puranas which discuss, which describe ten topics and the Upapuranas describe five topics. So Puranas are in this sense different from the Itihasis. Puranas are different in what sense? That they are very ancient, historical narrations may be there in the Puranas and they contain definite topics, either ten or five. So these Itihasis and Puranas are also accepted as Vedic literature though there are some transcendentalists, some Vedic scholars, don't accept the Itihasis and Puranas as Vedic literature. But actually because they are presenting the same Vedic message in the form of historical narrations they are also accepted as Vedas. So Vyasadeva particularly compiled the Itihasis and Puranas for the sake of explaining the Vedic message in an easily understandable way for the common people."

But in addition to these Itihasis and Puranas Vyasadeva was also not very happy or satisfied that he has done enough welfare activity. A Rishi or a Sadhu his life is dedicated for the welfare of the people in general. Because these Rishis or Sadhus as far as they are concerned because of their spiritual realization they are satisfied and happy and contented within themselves. They are Atmarama. Atmarama means one who can be self-satisfied does not require anything outside for his satisfaction. It is like all of us we require so many things externally for our satisfaction or for our happiness. Right? We are dependent on so many external things. Whereas a self-realized soul or an Atmarama a person who is Atmarama is satisfied within himself he does not require anything external for his satisfaction or happiness or contentment."

There are so many activities. There are so many different things they do. So a Sadhu or a Rishi is one who lives for the welfare of the others. So Vyasa Deva is a Rishi is a Sadhu whose life is only dedicated for the welfare of others. So how did he decide to do welfare activity for others? He put down the Vedas in writing. He compiled the Vedas. He did divided the Vedas into four parts. He summarized the Vedas. Further summarized and also wrote down Itihasas and Puranas. But in spite of doing all this he was not satisfied. He thought still is there something more I can do? This thought Vyasa Deva got from God before he wrote this last work or compiled the last book the Bhagavata Purana."

Narada Muni pointed out to Vyasa Deva that even though you have done so much of work even though you have compiled all the Vedas you have done all that you have done still and that's very big work it's not small work very big work still Vyasa Deva was experiencing dissatisfaction and Narada Muni noticed that and he told Vyasa Deva you are not satisfied or you are feeling insufficient because you are not actually properly glorified Krishna in all your Vedic literature. In all the literature you have not properly or sufficiently glorified Krishna. So Narada Muni directed Vyasa Deva to write the Bhagavatam this final contribution of Vyasa Deva the final work of Vyasa Deva the last work of Vyasa Deva in which Krishna is exclusively glorified. So Bhagavata is also called Krishna Samhita Samhita generally means Vedic literature. So Bhagavata is that Vedic literature which exclusively glorifies Krishna."

There is matter that we all know and there is something which normally people do not know and that is called spirit. So one should know in addition to what is matter one should also know what is spirit. And one should be able to distinguish or separate spirit from matter. Spirit is important matter is not important. Spirit is the essence which is of value to us and matter is not essential not of value to us. Our life generally is simply centered around matter. We are leading what is called as a material life concerned only with matter, including our body which we think is our self this body also is made up of matter. And everything around us we see we deal with is made up of matter. So this matter is not the essence is not important is not essential. So spirit is important.

Just like generally the milkman when he brings milk to your house he will generally if you take from a person who milks a cow generally they add milk to the water and give you. Water mixed with milk. Now if you present that water mixed with milk to a swam it will definitely drink that milk but it will only drink the milk portion. It will leave behind water. The swam has got this special quality. Means it is able to take the essence of the mixture of the milk and water. What is the essence? The milk. So it is able to take the nectar the amrita and leave behind the water. Similarly a Paramahamsa is a person who can extract the spiritual essence from a mixture of spirit and matter. So not only he can separate spirit from matter but he can also take the spiritual essence from a mixture of spirit and matter. So such a Paramahamsa specially for a Paramahamsa Vyasa Deva has compiled this Sriman Bhagavatam. So therefore this Bhagavatam is also called"

      "transcript": "Paramahamsa Samhita. It is also the literature which is the commentary or the explanation of the Vedanta Sutra by the author himself. As I said Vedanta Sutra is the cream of the cream. So it is very difficult to understand. For most people this Vedanta Sutra is difficult to understand. And even those who try to study the Vedanta Sutra after studying Sanskrit after studying the other Vedic literature they may misunderstand the meaning of the Sutras. There is a possibility that somebody even if they study in a scholarly way the Vedic literature and try to understand the meaning of the Vedanta Sutra they may misunderstand the meaning. In order to explain correctly the meaning of the Vedanta Sutra the author who has compiled the Vedanta Sutra himself has explained the Vedanta Sutra in the form of Sriman Bhagavatam. Therefore the Bhagavatam is so important in the literature. It is the ultimate Vedic book book of the Vedas book of the Vedic knowledge because it contains the cream of the cream of the Vedas and it also is presented in the form of a Purana Purana means historical narration so there are many Vedic books that contain the cream of the Vedanta Sutra so there are nice historical incidents described which make it very interesting. In the Vedanta Sutra there is no historical narration so it is very dry no stories no historical incidents it is very dry. So this Bhagavatam which explains the Vedanta Sutra is presented in a very unique format of a Purana. Also it explains the Vedanta Sutra which may be misunderstood by even some great scholars. So the author himself is explaining the Vedanta Sutra what is the meaning of the sutras in this Bhagavatam. Therefore this Bhagavatam is the most important Vedic literature."

So preliminary study of the Bhagavatam it is recommended to study the Bhagavad Gita. It is very impressive literature. What is the special position of the Bhagavad Gita? Just like Bhagavatam has got a very special position from all various literatures the Bhagavad Gita also has got a very special position. What is that? The Bhagavad Gita is the essence of all the Upanishads. So just like the Vedanta Sutra is the essence of all the Upanishads the Bhagavad Gita also is an essence of all the Upanishads. And Bhagavad Gita is presented as a conversation or a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna and it is also the essence of all the Upanishads. The Bhagavad Gita also is a very important Vedic literature. So the study of Bhagavad Gita as the preliminary study of the Bhagavatam and the actual study of the Bhagavatam itself are the Vedas these two books which are the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. If you study the Bhagavad Gita and you study the Bhagavatam you know the Vedas entirely what they are actually communicating. The entire Vedic message Vedic philosophy"

A mango fruit touched by the beak of a parrot becomes even more relishable. Fruit by itself is relishable. A ripened mango fruit by itself is relishable. But if a parrot touches it, parrot's beak touches it, parrot's mouth touches it, then it becomes even more relishable. Similarly, Bhagavatam, because it contains the rasa, bhakti rasa, it is relishable. It is very relishable. But it became more so when it came out of the mouth of Shukadeva Goswami. Just like a mango fruit when touched by the beak of a parrot becomes very relishable. Therefore, the name of the son of Vyasadeva who presented the Bhagavatam is called Shuka, compared to a parrot. Just like a parrot makes the mango very, very, very, very relishable, more nectarean, Shukadeva Goswami made this Bhagavatam more relishable by speaking the Bhagavatam to Parishad Mahabharata.
