In this session we will be discussing from the 43rd verse of the 9th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The prayers are over. Now Suta Goswami, who is narrating this whole incident to the sage Sunaimisharanya, he is speaking now. Suta Uvacha Krishna Evam Bhagavati Manovag Drishti Vritti Bhihi Atmani Atmanam Aveshya So Anta Shvasa Uparamat. The meaning of this verse is: Suta Goswami said, \"Thus Bhishma Deva merged himself in the Supersoul, Lord Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with his mind, speech, sight and actions, and thus he became silent and his breathing stilled.\" So this is the verse that is describing Bhishma Deva has quit his body in Krishna consciousness, because his mind, his speech, his sight and actions are all completely absorbed in Krishna. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, \"The stage attained by Bhishma Deva while quitting his material body is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi.\" This is a technical term. What is the meaning of this term Nirvikalpa Samadhi? That is also explained by Srila Prabhupada. Nirvikalpa Samadhi, it is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi because he, that is Bhishma Deva, merged himself into thinking of the Lord and his mind into remembering, remembering his different activities. He chanted the glories of the Lord, that is his speech. And by his sight, he began to see the Lord personally present before him. And thus, all his activities became concentrated upon the Lord without deviation. Samadhi means total absorption. Total absorption of the mind, of the thinking, that is the mind, activity of the mind, the speech, and the sight, and the very self. So, thinking, remembering, glorifying, and seeing, in all these ways, Bhishma was totally absorbed in thought of Krishna. This is the highest stage of perfection, this total absorption, and it is possible for everyone to attain this stage by practice of devotional service. So here, Prabhupada is teaching us that there is the highest perfectional stage to be attained in the practice of devotional service. Devotional service means practicing, focusing our attention on Krishna. Krishna means the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We are focusing our attention on Krishna. He has so many different features. So every possible way if we can absorb our self in thought of Krishna, in thinking of Krishna, in glorifying Krishna, in hearing about Krishna, in seeing Krishna's form either as the Deity or as the personally Krishna is present in the case of Bhishma. He is personally present. So Bhishma is directly seeing Krishna before quitting his body and the beautiful form. He is describing, he has already described in his prayers the beautiful form of Krishna."

      "transcript": "So this is the highest perfection to be attained and it is possible for anyone provided one practices devotional service. Now devotional service itself, how is it performed? So Srila Prabhupada says based on the explanation in the seventh canto of the Bhagavatam. The devotional service of the Lord Krishna consists of nine principles of service activities. Devotional service is not something idle, simply sitting and doing nothing. No. Devotional service, Bhakti, means devotional service. So it consists of service activities, activities rendered while having a service attitude. I want to serve Krishna to please him. I want to serve Krishna in a loving attitude. And these nine principles of service activities are described in the Bhagavatam seventh canto as: Number one, hearing, hearing about Krishna, Shravanam. Number two, chanting, Kirtanam. Number three, remembering, remembering in Sanskrit it is called Smaranam. Number four, serving the lotus feet of Krishna, Padashevanam. Number five, worshipping, Archanam, Deity worship, specifically Deity worship. Number six, praying, Vandanam, offering prayers, just like Bhishma did. He was remembering Krishna's pastimes. He was praying, offering prayers. He was chanting the glories of Krishna, and like that he was engaged in all possible ways in service activities before quitting his body, totally absorbed in that. So number seven, executing the orders, it's called Dasyam. A servant is specially meant for simply carrying out the orders of the master, just like Hanuman. Whatever Rama ordered, Hanuman simply carried out that order. So that is Dasyam. Then eighth one of the list of nine service activities, eighth one is fraternizing, Sakhyam, acting as a rendering service rather, as a friend of the Lord, friend of Lord Krishna, just like Arjuna, rendering service as a friend of Krishna. And the final one, ninth one, fully surrendering, Atma Nivedanam, total self surrender. Bali Maharaj. Each one of these, we have an ideal described in the Bhagavatam. Any one of them, any one of the nine or all of them are equally competent to award the desired result. That is the highest perfection of total absorption of oneself in the Supreme Lord Krishna, but they require to be practiced persistently"

      "summary": "This segment stresses the importance of practicing devotional service under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, highlighting hearing (Shravanam) as the most important of the nine principles, and advocating for hearing and reading Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam as Krishna katha.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/Myj43RT1ytI?t=576",
      "transcript": "under the guidance of an expert devotee of the Lord. Who is that expert devotee of the Lord? The bona fide spiritual master. So the bona fide spiritual master gives guidance, gives instructions, helps the disciple to actually practice one or more of these nine items, nine principles of service activities rendered for Krishna by a devotee. And they have to be practiced. In the beginning, it will not be very nicely done, but by repeatedly doing, again and again, abhyasa yoga yuktena cetasa na anyagamina, without deviation of the attention, persistently focused. The attention, mainly the attention, completely focused on Krishna. So of these nine, Srila Prabhupada says, the first item, hearing, is the most important item of all. Bhakti begins with hearing. So the most important item is hearing, shravanam. And therefore, hearing of the Bhagavad Gita and later on Srimad Bhagavatam is essential for the serious candidate who wants to attain the stage of Bhishma Deva at the end. So practice hearing Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. From whom should you hear? From Srila Prabhupada. For all of us now, we should hear from Prabhupada. Prabhupada has given discourses and he also has written Bhagavad Gita translation and purport, Bhagavatam translation and purport. So we should read or we should hear somebody else reading Prabhupada's book, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. And in this way, we should completely become absorbed in the subject matter that is described in the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam. Both are Krishna katha. Bhagavad Gita is personally spoken by Krishna and Bhagavatam is spoken by Shukadeva Goswami and other great devotees about Krishna. So they are both Krishna katha and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed everyone to hear these two scriptures, Krishna katha as given in these two scriptures, Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam and thereby perfect our devotional selves."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/Myj43RT1ytI?t=774",
      "transcript": "The unique situation at Bhishma Deva's time of death can be attained even though Lord Krishna may not be personally present. In the case of Bhishma, he was very very fortunate and it's rare that Krishna is personally present before the devotee who is quitting his body. That's very special, very rare. Bhishma Deva was blessed by Krishna. But even if Krishna is not personally present in front of us, when we are quitting the body, we can attain that situation that Bhishma was himself in. In that Nirvikalpa Samadhi, total absorption of the self in Krishna is possible. How? So Prabhupada says, \"His words of the Bhagavad Gita or those of Srimad Bhagavatam are identical with the Lord.\" This is the meaning of Krishna is absolute. Krishna, the person, his form, his qualities, his pastimes, his words, his descriptions, his paraphernalia, his abode, all are identical 100% with Krishna. And there is no difference at all between them. So Prabhupada describes Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavatam as sound incarnations of the Lord. And one can fully utilize them to be entitled to the stage of Sri Bhishma Deva, who was one of the eight Vasus. Bhishma Deva, before this birth, he was one of the eight Vasus in the upper planets. He took birth as Bhishma and he attained this perfection. Everyone has to quit the body, but quitting the body like Bhishma Deva is the ideal, not dying in ignorance, not dying in thought of something else or someone else, but dying in thought of Krishna. I'll stop here. Thank you very much."
