      "transcript": "There is another verse which says in Chaitanya Charitamrita: Atayiva krishnera nama deha vilasa prakritendriya grahiyanayi hai svaprakasha. The holy name of Krishna, His body, His pastimes, cannot be understood by the blunt material senses, prakritendriya grahiyanayi. Then how do you know? Hai svaprakasha, they are manifested independently. When you sincerely serve the shakti-avesha nama with attention, with transcendental faith in His unmanifest presence before you, He will purify us, and He, on His own, will manifest that Chaitanya rasa vighraha nama to our consciousness, to our spiritual senses."
