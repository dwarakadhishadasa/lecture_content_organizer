      "transcript": "In this session, we will be discussing from the 26th verse of the 8th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, continuing the prayers by Queen Kunti. The meaning of this verse is: One who is on the path of material progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great opulence, high education, and bodily beauty, cannot approach you with sincere feeling. So Kunti Devi is revealing a secret about the way to approach Krishna—the simple ways to call out Krishna's name and in this way directly come in contact with Krishna, approach Krishna. But there is a quality to such utterance of the name or calling out the name. So she is telling here, one can approach with sincere feeling if they are materially exhausted. If they are puffed up with material opulence, then they cannot sincerely call out the Lord's name."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/miGfEiJovzg?t=163",
      "transcript": "So Srila Prabhupada says, \"Being materially advanced means taking birth in an aristocratic family and possessing great wealth, Janma, Aishwarya, and education, Shruta, and attractive personal beauty, Shri, Janma, Aishwarya, Shruta, Shri.\" These four are described here. All materialistic men are mad after possessing all these material opulences, and this is known as the advancement of material civilization. The whole world practically is in ignorance about the spiritual truths, spiritual reality, and therefore, people are mad after material opulence. But the result is that by possessing all these material assets, one becomes artificially puffed up. We are being intoxicated by such temporary possessions. Why is it said artificially puffed up? Because there is no real asset to be proud of. It is simply some illusory possession that people become proud of. How long can you have your wealth? How long can you have bodily beauty? How long can you have material uprightness, education? Only as long as the body lasts. At the most, after that, everything is separated. Everything is separated from you. Can you take your wealth with you when you put the body to your next life? Can you take your material education? Can you take any material possessions? No, you cannot. So therefore, it is described here, these material assets make one materially opulent, meaning artificially."

      "summary": "The lecture emphasizes the power of chanting the Lord's name, highlighting the difference between sincere devotion and external displays, and the importance of feeling in the utterance.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/miGfEiJovzg?t=315",
      "transcript": "The buddha shloka and other buddhas are incapable of uttering the holy name of the Lord by addressing him feelingly, \"Oh Govinda, Oh Krishna.\" You see, the quality of uttering the name, that is important also. It's not just that somebody is able to say the name. Now, Shilpa Prabhupada explains a very important point here. He says, \"It is said in the shastras,\" is quoting from the scriptures, \"that by once uttering the holy name of the Lord, the sinner gets rid of a quantity of sins that is unable to commit.\" That means even once uttering the name of the Lord is so powerful, so effective, it can destroy any quantity of sin. It doesn't matter what the quantity of sin is. So such is the power of uttering the holy name of the Lord, chanting Hare Krishna, simply vibrating the tongue and producing the sound Hare Krishna. He's very, very, very powerful. So such is the power of uttering the holy name of the Lord. There is not the least exaggeration in this statement. What the shastras are telling, that any quantity of sin can be destroyed completely by just one utterance of the holy name, is not an exaggeration. It's a fact. It's a 100% fact actually. The Lord's holy name has such powerful potency. There's a secret that is known to the pure devotees and to those who are associated with the pure devotes. But there is a quality of such utterances also. It depends on the quality of feeling. So there is difference between a sincere devotee calling out for Krishna by chanting his name, by uttering his name, Krishna, and there is a difference between a sincere devotee and a person who is not so sincere but simply makes an external show that I can also chant. No, it's not going to be effective if one is not a sincere devotee, if one doesn't utter with feeling."

      "transcript": "So that is explained by Prabhupada: a helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord, whereas a man who utters the same Holy Name in great material satisfaction cannot be so sincere. So sincerity is being explained specifically. He, what does it mean to be sincere enchanting Hare Krishna? It means that have within the heart the feeling of utter helplessness, utter helplessness. Sheila proper says in another place that just like a very, very small child cries for the mother, the child cries helplessly, helplessly, so the mother is particularly attentive to the child who cries helplessly. Immediately she attends to the child. Similarly, when man utters the Lord's Holy Name in helpless state of feeling, then the Lord immediately appears and actually takes care of the devotee. A materially puffed up person may utter the Holy Name of the Lord occasionally, but he is incapable of uttering the name in quality. So quality of the Lord is the state of feeling. That is not the state of reality is not there in the utterance by materially satisfied people. Therefore, the four principles of material advancement which are mentioned by Kunti Devi in this prayer, which are the four principles—high parentage, good wealth, high education, attractive beauty—are so to speak disqualifications for"

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/miGfEiJovzg?t=716",
      "transcript": "There is something mental, how to warfare between good and bad, of another political understanding that all these material opulences are useless for spiritual practice. The material covering of the pure spirit soul is an external feature. All the material opulences are like an external covering, as much as the body, our mind, material mind, material intelligence, all these are external coverings of the spirit soul. As much as here is an example, Prabhupada gives an example, as much as fever is an external feature of the unhealthy body, very good example. The general process is to decrease the degree of the fever and not to aggravate it by maltreatment. And somebody gets fever, it is an indication of unhealthy body. So what should one do? One should try to decrease the fever, not increase it. Similarly, it is sometimes seen that spiritually advanced persons become materially impoverished, and this is no discouragement. This is not discouraging if they become materially very poor after making spiritual advancement. On the other hand, such impoverishment is a good sign, as much as the falling of temperature is a good sign. Nobody wants to increase the fever. When somebody gets fever, they want to reduce it. Similarly, material wealth, there is no need of increasing material wealth when one spiritually advances. There's no need. If one's material wealth reduces, that's a good sign. It is not a sign of misfortune. No, the principle of life should always be to decrease the degree of material intoxication, which leads one to be more and more illusioned about the aim of life. All these"

Krishna says, Dheera Stratra Namukhyati, one who is sober, he's not, he or she is not bewildered by this material opulence or material wealth."
