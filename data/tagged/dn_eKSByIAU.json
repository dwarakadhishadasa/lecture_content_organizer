      "transcript": "Yeah, scriptures explain that all of us have a relationship with Krishna. Sit down. All of us have a relationship with Krishna, but before we understand our relationship with Krishna, we have to cleanse our heart of so many dirty things that are there which are making us forget Krishna. We have to cleanse our heart. So, for cleansing, the best process is chanting Hare Krishna. You chant Hare Krishna, you cleanse your heart. Then, after cleansing the heart, you will understand who is Krishna, who you are, and then the relationship also, you will understand. So that relationship is based on love. So, similarly, friendship with Krishna, you can have friendly relation with Krishna, you can serve Krishna as a servant. You can serve Krishna as one's own son, like mother Yashoda, Devaki, Vasudeva. They are all serving Krishna as their son, or Krishna can be served as one's beloved."
