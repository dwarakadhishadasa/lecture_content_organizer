The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami addressed the rishis headed by Saunaka. What did Suta Goswami tell the sages? Now I shall begin the transcendental narration of the Lord Sri Krishna and topics of the birth activities and deliverance of King Parikshit, the sage amongst kings, as well as topics of the renunciation of the worldly order by the sons of Pandu."

After answering their initial six questions, Suta Goswami started telling them, \"I see that you are very eager to hear about Krishna. So, best is that I narrate the Srimad Bhagavatam because Bhagavatam is Krishna Katha.\" Therefore, Suta Goswami said, here he is telling, \"I shall begin transcendental narration of the Lord Shri Krishna,\" and how will he begin such a narration of Krishna Katha by narrating topics of the birth activities and deliverance of King Pariksit, the Raja Rishi, as well as topics of the renunciation of the worldly order by the sons of Pandu. By the Pandavas' renunciation, what is the connection between Pandavas renouncing this world and Krishna Katha? And again, what is the connection between Pariksit's birth activities and deliverance with Krishna Katha?"

The same historical narrations which are in relationship with Krishna become transcendental narrations, and without this Krishna, they are all material facts, material histories, that's all. When we hear the activities of the devotees of Krishna in relationship with Krishna, we at once become transcendental, related with Krishna, immediately the connection, spiritual connection, is established. So, Srimad Bhagavatam is also a Purana. Purana means that which contains a very ancient history. But the special significance of this Purana, Bhagavata Purana, is that the activities of the Lord are central and not just supplementary historical facts."

Birth, activities of Parikshit Maharaj, this is not material description because the central topic is the activities of Krishna. Everything is centered around the activities of Krishna. Every narration, you will find there is some relationship with activities of Krishna, connection with activities of Krishna. Without such connection with Krishna, none of these narrations are spiritual,"

Now, here is an important point Prabhupada is stressing: \"There is a class of less intelligent devotees of Bhagavata Purana who desire to relish at once the activities of the Lord narrated in the 10th canto without first understanding the primary cantos.\" See, Bhagavatam is presented by Vyasa Deva systematically in 12 cantos. 12 cantos, 1st canto, 2nd canto, 3rd canto. We are in the 1st canto now. Like this, there are 12 cantos. Each canto is very big. Each canto contains several chapters. Each chapter contains several verses. And each verses got so much of depth. We just went through the Atmarama verse. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave 61 meanings of the Atmarama verse. Of course, I didn't describe all the 61 meanings, but I described some of them. Like that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu points out there is so much depth in the Srimad Bhagavatam. This is the spotless Purana because it contains narrations of the activities of Krishna which are central to everything discussed in the Srimad Bhagavatam. So, it's not that the 10th canto which specifically describes Krishna's appearance and activities as the original personality of God alone is important. No. Every single canto of Bhagavatam, beginning from the 1st canto, is having spiritual description."

That's what these foolish people think. And thus, more foolishly than intelligently, they take to the reading of the 10th canto. They directly jump to the 10th canto. They say, \"We have nothing to do with Pandavas and Parikshit and Prithu Maharaj and Pracheya. All that we are not interested. We are only interested in Krishna, Krishna Leela.\" But actually, these readers are specifically told herein that the other cantos of the Bhagavatam are as important as the 10th canto. That's why, what does Suta Goswami tell the sages in this verse? Suta Goswami says, I am going to narrate the history of the birth, the activities, and deliverance of King Parikshit, as well as the topics of renunciation of the Pandavas. Now, what has that got to do with Krishna Katha? That is what exactly we have to do. We have to understand that devotees are never without Krishna, and Krishna is never without devotees. Neither does Krishna perform activities alone, nor do devotees perform any activity alone without Krishna. So, devotees are always situated in Krishna consciousness, and Krishna is always doing everything in relationship to Krishna. And Krishna is always involved in joint devotion to..."

So, Sridhar Prabhupada concludes by telling, Krishna and his pure devotees like the Pandavas are on the same plane, spiritual platform, pure devotional platform. Krishna is not without his devotees. Of all the rasas, Krishna is described as akhila rasamruta sindhu. He is full of varieties of rasas and his ocean of all rasas, and the pure devotees like Pandavas are not without Krishna. They are never without Krishna. So, the devotees and the Lord are interlinked, and they can never be separated, never. Therefore, talks about them all are Krishna Katha, talks about the devotees, talks about Krishna in relationship with the devotees, or talks about the devotees in relationship with Krishna, everything is Krishna Katha."
