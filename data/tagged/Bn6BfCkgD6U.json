      "transcript": "If we carefully study the scriptures, we understand there is no safe place which is free from all dangers in this material existence. Material existence means anytime there can be death. So, therefore, it is only because of the influence of the illusory energy that we think that sometimes I am safe, sometimes there is danger for my life. Actually, dangers are always existing. But where is absolute safety in this material world? There is no place which is absolutely safe. So, unless we come out of illusion, we are unable to realize that we should not stay in this material world even one moment more. We should immediately get out of material existence and go to our original position."
