Only a devotee... who is in intimate relation with Kṛṣṇa, he can understand. That is clearly stated here. When Kṛṣṇa was speaking Bhagavad-gītā to Arjuna, it was in the battlefield. It is not a parlor, discussing, smoking and discussing business. No. It is not like that. Very serious, in the battlefield. And Kṛṣṇa selected Arjuna. At that time, when Kṛṣṇa was present, there were very, very great learned scholars. Even Vyāsadeva was present there, the Veda-vyāsa, and many others. Asita, Devaloka, great, great saintly persons and saints. Rājarṣis. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was rājarṣi because in the previous verse he says, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ. So why he selected Arjuna? He was a military man. He was not a Vedāntist. A military man is not supposed to become a Vedāntist, very great sannyāsī. No. Because the so-called Vedāntists, they cannot understand Bhagavad-gītā. It is not possible. It is a mystery. Kṛṣṇa in other places says, nāhaṁ prakāśa-sarvasya-yoga-māyā-samābhṛtaḥ. I cannot be exposed to anyone. Yoga-māyā-samābhṛtaḥ. Therefore those who are fools, rascals, they consider Kṛṣṇa as fictitious, Kṛṣṇa as a human being, Kṛṣṇa as a historical person, or there was no Kṛṣṇa, it is an imaginary writing. Because these rascals, they cannot understand. Unless one is a bona fide devotee and intimately related with Kṛṣṇa,"

Just like you have kindly come here to hear about Kṛṣṇa. This is the beginning of bhakti. Unless you hear about the Supreme Person, that is Vedic process, śruti. Śruti. Veda is known as śruti. Śruti-śmiti-pūrānādi-pāñcarātrika-vidhiṁ vinā ahikāntaki harer bhakti utpātāya-vakalpataḥ. If one does not follow the principle, Vedic principle, smṛti, the Vedic corollaries, smṛti means literature which is written according to Vedic principle. That is called smṛti. And śruti means the Vedas. Bhaktā-śrūta-gṛhitaya. Śrūta-gṛhitaya. Śrūta-gṛhitās are two meanings: by hearing or through the Vedic literature. Through the Vedic literature, only bhaktis. There are three kinds of departmental study in the Vedas. First thing is sambandha. Sambandha means what is my relationship with God. This is stated there. In the Vedānta it is said, janmādy asya yataḥ. The absolute truth is that from whom everything is generated. So everything amongst everything I am also. You are also. So you are also coming from that supreme absolute truth. Kṛṣṇa says, mam evāṁśa jīva-bhūtaḥ. All these living entities, sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya, in every species, any form of life, saṁyavanti-mūrtaḥ, as many forms are there, not only human being, the animals. The trees, the birds, the aquatics, the insects, everyone, all living entities. Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya saṁyavanti-mūrtaḥ. In any species of life, as many forms are there, ahaṁ vija-pradabhitāḥ. I am their original father. Vija-pradabhitāḥ, seed-giving father. So as father places the seeds within the womb of the mother, similarly the material nature is the mother, and Kṛṣṇa is the father. Kṛṣṇa impregnates the material nature, and we come out in different forms."

And anda-ya, through the eggs, just like the birds, the living entities coming through the eggs. That is called anda-ya. Seda-ya, anda-ya, jarā-yuja, embryo. Just like we are coming from the embryo, anda-ya, jarā-yuja, and udvija. Coming from the seeds, the trees, plants. So within these four groups, all different living entities are coming.

When we can understand that this process of repetition of birth, death, old age and disease, this is not wanted by me, nobody wants to die, but the death is forced upon him. He does not think that this is my problem. I do not want to die, but death is as sure as anything. So this is the problem. Nobody is careful how to solve this problem.

Unless we come to the serious point, unless you have become very intelligent, that I do not want to die. Why death is there? This is intelligence. You may solve your temporary problem, but you cannot by your so-called materialistic activities. The problem of death. Nobody wants to die. mṛtyu-sarva-harasya-haṁ. Death will come. But the people have become so much unintelligent, they do not take up seriously the real problems. Just like animals. The animals is being taken to the slaughterhouse. One animal enters to the slaughterhouse store, livestock store. All the animals enters. He does not know that this, I have to stay here for being killed. He does not know. This is animal. Similarly, if you do not take this problem seriously, you are no better than animal. However, you may be advanced for this bodily comfort. You are animal. yasyānta-buddhi-kuṇapeti-dhātuke. This bag of three elements, kava-vitva-vayu, if I think that I am this body and the comfort of this body is my happiness, sa eva go-kharo, you are no better than animal. This is animal conception of life. You must know that I am not this body. I am spirit soul. Circumstantially I have been put into this body, and again I will be put into another body. So what is the solution of this problem? That is Bhagavad-gītā."

Now by forgetting God, forgetting Kṛṣṇa, you are busy with the temporary problems, but you are forgetting the real problem. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, the bhaktoṣi, one has to become bhakto. The bhakto means Bhagavan. If there is Bhagavan, then there is bhakto, and there is bhakti. But these people are denying the existence of Bhagavan. There is no God. Then how He can become bhakto? Or how there will be execution of bhakti? Bhakto bhagavān bhakti. The same thing. Bhakto is in relationship with Bhagavan, and the transaction between Bhagavan and bhakto is called bhakti."

These are the definition of bhakti. Bhakti, without bhakti, nobody can become bhakti. Bhakti means one who is executing bhakti. That is bhakti. And the beneficiary, the beneficiary is the Bhagavān.

So if you do not accept this object, this temple worship, how you can become always be engaged in the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa? These are the processes. These are not sentiments. This is the scientific process. If you want, your business is to become bhakti, that is perfection. And because Arjuna was bhakti, therefore Kṛṣṇa is speaking to him. So if you become, it is not monopolized by Arjuna. If you also become bhakti, Kṛṣṇa will speak to you. Now he says, where is God? Where is God? Here is God. God is speaking. Why don't you see God? God is speaking. You'll find in the seventh chapter, if you cannot see God, if you cannot see Kṛṣṇa in the temple, if you cannot see Kṛṣṇa within Bhagavad-gītā, then Kṛṣṇa says, raśo'haṁ apsukam teyaḥ prabhāsaṁ miṣaśa-śūryaḥ. You see while you drink water. Or anything you drink, you can see Kṛṣṇa there. Raśo. That taste is Kṛṣṇa. So there is no difficulty to see God. These rascals, they said, where is God? Here is God.
