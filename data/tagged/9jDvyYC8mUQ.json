By hearing, by hearing we need to give the mind. Only when you hear, the mind becomes pure. Mind means chittam. Mind means manas, buddhi, ahankara. Three layers. Ego, intelligence, mind. They all have to... Asat, achitta and nirananda are sitting in these three places. And when we attentively hear, this shakti avesha nama is touching all these three. When you hear, mind is required. When you chant, your ego is required. I am chanting. I am hearing. So in this way, attentive hearing, chanting and hearing attentively brings tremendous difference to this self."

You will know why you have to be attentive. You know why you have to be respectful. You know why you have to be joyfully chant. Lord Himself is before me. If that fundamental shraddha is developed, for shraddha also, these are all the wonderful analogies that the acharyas have given in order to build our shraddha. That Lord is before me when I chant and He is before each one of us personally. It is not that the Lord does not care. Lord... The Supreme Lord cares for every amsa, every one of us.

And then you practice that stage three. So, everything comes from Shravanam. Your consciousness is grounded with Shravanam. And we hear from Guru, Sadhu and Shastra, all the narratives. The narratives from Guru, Sadhu and Shastra, is what creates our perceptions about the world, about the thing, about the people, about Nama, about Krishna, everything. So, somewhere we have to start. Then what happens? When you Anushilanam, when you practice it, then you develop a relationship ego. I am servant of a realistic relationship ego, that I am servant of Nama Prabhu. I am chanter, I am hearer, I am tasker, I am serving. So, once that relationship is there, that is what, as soon as you take your beat back, your relationship persona with the Holy Name, along with its, along with his Shraddha, Preeti, everything that you have developed, that will automatically come. So, then every beat will be a relationship with the Nama."

Because, God Himself has come before, and I have neglected Him. I am spiritually deaf, dumb and blind. I am unable to, you know, recognize, the, what is the significance of, being in touch with Krishna Himself, in His Shabdavatara, so mercifully. So, but, I am insensitive. So you have to beg forgiveness, from the Lord. Seva Apeksha. Begging orders for service from Nama Prabhu. Now, the sixteenth round. Whole day, let my day be only for, whatever you decide I should do. I am simply a puppet in your hands. May Prabhupada's order, may your order, manifest in different ways in my heart, and I act as your servant, and then, go to bed, happily sleep. Again get up in the morning. Again, do your sixteen rounds. End with Seva Apeksha. Your prayers will never fail. The whole day, Nama Prabhu, if you are doing fifteen rounds, and sixteenth round like this, whole day, you are getting, direct instruction, from Prabhupada, from the Transcendental Platform, from the spiritual world. You will be directed. You will never, day after day, you will be directed."

Shraddha, hearing and Shraddha, is fundamental. All others are, bonus. Comes later. But this you have to, somehow you have to struggle. That's why I said, about Nama Tattva. Simple things. What I told in ten minutes, that should be Mananam. You should, next one month, two months, think about it. How it is true. It becomes part of you. Shraddha, is very important. Shraddha is foundation. It is lack of Shraddha, that makes us, mechanical. If Shraddha is deep, it will not become mechanical. So, you tackle this first thing, of Shraddha. Develop that faith, in what, Guru Sadhu and Shastra, has said about, Nama, Nama Avatara, Shakti Avasya Nama, Shuddha Nama, etc, etc."

If you don't hear, you are not taking it. It is remaining in the ears. Every Hare, every Krishna, every Rama, I will take inside. That practice is called, Mindful. Practice of Mindful Japa. These are just training. The mind will learn, what you teach. If you teach your mind, don't think anything now, during Japa. It will learn. Thousand times, you have to tell that. You have to stop it, when it thinks. It will learn. Don't hear your thoughts. Hear the Nama. You teach, hundred times you teach, it will learn. You will be surprised. Any good things, you teach the mind, mind will follow. Any bad things, it will follow. So, such a big thing, that, we can train our mind, and mind will, completely help us, in good Japa. Not that, mind is always a problem. Mind is a problem, because, we have made it a problem. We can teach, how to support us, in Japa, the mind."
