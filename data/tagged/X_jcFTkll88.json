Because wherever there is goal there is also falsity, intoxication, lust, envy and enmity. So, if you remember the previous verse Kali was given four places by Maharaj Pariksit where gambling goes on, where drinking liquor is indulged in, where there is illicit connection with women, prostitution and where there is animal slaughter."

You didn't give me any place. So, then Parikshit Maharaj, because Kali had surrendered, he gave him a fifth place. That place where gold is accumulated for non-devotional purposes. So, Prabhupada says in the purport further, Maharaj Parikshit thus gave Kali permission to go. He gave Kali permission to live in a place where there is gold, because wherever there is gold, there are all the above mentioned four things and over and above them there is enmity also. What are the four defects of accumulating gold for any purpose other than devotional service? There will be falsity, Andhritam, Madham, intoxication, Kamam, lust."

Now, that is the system most countries have including India that they have currency notes issued by the government. Now, what is the value of that currency note, the piece of paper? Now, they say, the government says that this paper has got a value because it is valuable because it is based on the reserve gold that is kept stored in the government safe deposit vaults. But, the reality is the government issues currency notes not exactly based on the value of the gold stored in their vaults. They issue much more currency notes than the gold there. So, Prabhupada says the basic principle is falsity."

For example, if let us say the government has gold worth 100 crores. The government has gold worth let us say 100 million rupees just to give you an example. If the total currency notes in circulation, printed currency notes is more than 100 million rupees, then that is a falsity and that is what exactly is happening. So, Prabhupada says currency notes are issued in value beyond that of the actual reserve gold. So, there is falsity right here by the government itself. See, the government should themselves not be practicing falsity and they should regulate the citizens to avoid falsity. Now, here government itself is not practicing falsity. Government itself is practicing falsity when they issue currency notes beyond the value of the reserve gold. So, what happens if they issue such currency? This artificial inflation of currency that means they are giving issuing more notes than what they should be issuing. This is called artificial inflation. By the authorities encourages prostitution of the state economy. The state economy is completely spoiled. It is ruined. The state economy is ruined."

See, people have more currency notes in their hand than the actual reserve gold. And the value of the goods that are available. These currency notes are just a medium of exchange. So, if I have currency notes worth let us say 10,000 rupees. If these 10,000 rupees can purchase some goods worth what they say is worth 10,000, but if the equation is not commensurate with actual total value of the goods then there is inflation, artificial inflation in the price of the commodities. The price of the commodities will go up because the supply of the goods will not correspond with the supply of the currency notes. There will be more currency notes in supply and the goods will be less. So, what happens? People's buying power will exhaust all the goods and people will have money but there will be no goods. So, the price of the commodities will naturally go up when there is scarcity. Bad money drives away good money. So, this is what is called as bad money."

Whatever the government has got the reserve gold, they should make gold coins and that should be the currency. That should be the medium of exchange and this will stop the prostitution of gold. Gold will not be misused anymore. Gold ornaments for women may be allowed by control not by quality but by quantity. What about women using gold ornaments? That was always there in the Vedic culture. So, now how can government avoid people accumulating too much gold in the form of gold ornaments for women? So, government has to regulate by quantity the gold that people possess. Otherwise, if they possess too much of gold, that will simply lead to lust, envy, enmity, etc. So, by restricting the quantity of gold people can have, this will discourage lust, envy and enmity. When there is actual gold currency in the form of coins, the influence of gold in producing falsity will automatically cease. It will automatically stop. Nobody can cheat. If there are gold coins for currency, then nobody can cheat. Neither the government nor the people can cheat."
