In fact, they started the preaching movement in one sense, officially, and opening of the temple. So Shamananda also was in that group who was preaching a lot in Orissa. He comes in Nithyananda Prabhu's line. So his parampara is Nithyananda Prabhu. Nithyananda Prabhu's disciple is Gauridas Pandit. And Gauridas Pandit's disciple is Hridaya Chaitanya. And Hridaya Chaitanya's disciple is Shamananda Prabhu."

So like in South also, there are some names, like in Tamil Nadu they say Pichai. In Tamil Nadu, I think they say Kempe. So these are the ways, bad names they give, negative names so that Yama Raj will not touch. So since many people died in the house, many children died, his mother named him Dukkhi"

He was the crest jewel of the enjoyers of sacred rapture. May he appear day and night in my mind bringing an appreciation for the essence of the joys Beloved of Shri Radha. Shamananda Prabhu was born on the full moon day of Chaitra in 1534 in the town of Dharendra, Bahudarpura, which is near the Kargapura railway station in Medinipura. His father was Shri Krishna Mandala and his mother Durika. Prior to Shamananda's birth, his parents had lost several children during childbirth and they vowed to surrender their next child to Vishnu if he survived. Having suffered so much grief in the loss of their previous children, they first named Shamananda as Dukhi or Unhappy to ward off further distress."

Shamananda used to carefully listen to the glories of Gauranga and Nityananda from devotees. When listening to the activities of Gauranithai or those of Radha and Krishna, tears would flow in waves from his eyes. Dukhi told his parents that he wished to take Diksha from Hrudaya Chaitanya, who was the disciple of Gauridas Pandit, and his parents happily permitted him. When Dukhi arrived in Amitabha, Hrudaya Chaitanya happily gave him Krishna Mantra and named him Krishna Das. From then on, Dukhi was known as Dukhi Krishna Das. Hrudaya Chaitanya ordered him to go to Vrindavan and engage in Vajana. In Vrindavan, Dukhi Krishna Das studied the Vaishnava scriptures under Shri Jivagoswami, who was the leading scholar of the Sampradaya. While in Vrindavan, he was given the name Shabana. Shabana was known as Shamananda because he brought great joy to Shamsundar. When Jiva saw his charming activities, he kept him nearby and instructed him in the Vaishnava scriptures. This is as per Bhakti Ratnakara. In 1532, Shri Jivagoswami sent Srinivasa Acharya, Narottam Das Thakur, and Shamananda back to Bengal with the Vaishnava literature."

      "transcript": "Throughout Bengal and Orissa, Narottama went to northern Bengal and Shamananda went to Orissa. Radharani's special mercy on Shamananda. Even though Shamananda Prabhu was Hrudaya Chaitanya's initiated disciple, his guru had entrusted him to the care of Jivagoswami Prabhu. Through the association of Jiva and service to him, Shamananda developed a taste for serving Radha and Krishna. In the conjugal mood, an extraordinary incident which took place in Vrindavan prior to his being ordered by Jiva to return to Orissa, demonstrates how dear Shamananda was to Radharani. One day, Shamananda Prabhu was sweeping the Rasa Mandala in Vrindavan, absorbed in an ecstatic trance. Suddenly, by Radharani's transcendental mercy, he found her ankle bracelet torn. He saw the ankle bracelet lying on the ground. In his excitement, he touched the ankle bracelet to his forehead, where it left a mark preserved to this day as the Tilak marking of the disciple's descendant of Shamananda. It is known as Nupura Tilaka. You must have noticed the Tilaka that Babaji is wearing is the shape of the footprint of Radharani or Nupura. There are two stories, one says it is Radharani's seat, one says it is Nupura. So it is called Nupura Tilaka. So they are called the Samanandis today."

Srinivas sang Kirtan in a style called Manoharasahi. Manoharasahi in Karanahati and Shamananda in Renithi, these are the three styles of Kirtan, which was popularized by these three personalities. He would enchant the listeners with his heartfelt singing of Kirtan. As a result of his preaching in Orissa, many Muslims also became Shamananda's disciples. The most important of his innumerable disciples was Resika Murari. Resikananda was the son of Achutananda, the Jamindar of Rohini village. He had another name Murari and was thus most commonly known as Resika Murari. He was a very powerful preacher and his fame is still widespread through the village of Orissa. A list of some of Shamananda's prominent disciples and related pastimes is given in Bhakti Ratnakara. Shamananda Prabhu lived the last part of his life in Narasinghapura in Orissa, where he continued preaching Vaishnavism. His earthly pastime came to an end on the first day of the waning moon in the month of Ashada in 1630 A.D. The temple compound houses, Shamananda Prabhu's Samadhi, which we saw here, as well as the bhajan kutir. One can have darshan of Shamananda Prabhu's worship of Radha Mohan, it is here. This place is also renowned as Gupta Vrindavan. As Shri Shamananda had dug up two ponds over here, in which he had installed Shri Radha kunda and Shama kunda."
