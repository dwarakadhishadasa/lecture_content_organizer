As part of this ISKCON law, the GBC resolved, under subsection C of this Resolution No. 405, in order to offer appropriate respect to Srila Prabhupada as founder acharya and pre-eminent spiritual master of ISKCON. It is considered an essential devotional practice for all ISKCON devotees to observe or perform Srila Prabhupada's guru puja daily, either in an ISKCON temple or, if not possible, in one's home. So, the GBC made it mandatory for all devotees in ISKCON, irrespective of who was their diksha guru, to perform guru puja for Srila Prabhupada daily, either in the temple or at home."

So, for their pre-eminent Shiksha Guru, Srila Prabhupada, the devotees during the Guru Puja, sing the Shri Guru Vandana song penned by Shri Launarothamadas Thakur daily, every day, mandatorily. In this song, that every devotee in ISKCON must compulsorily sing for Srila Prabhupada every single day of his life, it begins with Shri Guru Charanapadma Kevala Bhakati Sadma, meaning, Srila Prabhupada's lotus feet are the shelter of Shri Guru. In the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 15, verse 108 purport, Srila Prabhupada quotes Shri Launarothamadas Thakur from his Bhakti Sandarbha, where Shri Launarothamadas Thakur says, Deeksha Vidhanena Shri Guru Charana Sampaditam. Shri Launarothamadas Thakur translates this as, Receiving the Grace of a bona fide spiritual master through initiation. That means, receiving the mercy of Guru or Shri Guru Charanapadma happens through initiation. In other words, Shri Guru Charanapadma in the Guru Vandana refers to the Deeksha Guru, not just to some preeminent Deeksha Guru. And then, the devotees, have to sing, Vandohmui Savadahana Mate, meaning, I bow down to the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada with great awe and reverence."

Jahara Prasade Bhai, Ebhava Toriyajai, Krishna Prapti Hoi Jaha Hoite. Meaning, by Srila Prabhupada's grace, because we are singing this song for Prabhupada, this is an offering to Prabhupada, so by Srila Prabhupada's grace, we can cross over the material existence and we can attain Krishna. That means, every devotee in ISKCON must sing every single day of his life that he can cross over the material existence and attain Krishna by Srila Prabhupada's grace.

There, Srila Prabhupada says, it is the spiritual master who delivers the disciple from the clutches of Maya. How? By initiating him into the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. So clearly, it is the responsibility of the Diksha Guru to deliver the disciple from the material existence."

      "transcript": "In the Nectar of Instruction, purport to verse 7, Srila Prabhupada says, if one is sincere, he is initiated and this stage is called Bhajanak Kriya. One then actually engages in the service of the Lord by regularly chanting the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra 16 rounds daily and refraining from illicit sex, intoxicants, meat-eating and gambling. By Bhajanak Kriya, one attains freedom from the contamination of materialistic life. So if the Diksha Guru delivers one from material contamination, why are the devotees in ISKCON mandated to sing every day that it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers them from material existence? Instead of their Diksha Guru, they can sing about the Diksha Guru only once a day in a year. Whereas, they are singing every day to Srila Prabhupada 365 days a year, that it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers them from material existence. It is Prabhupada who delivers them from there, from the material existence. So how is it that the Shiksha Guru is delivering the disciple from the clutches of material existence whereas the Shiksha Guru is not doing it? While you ponder over that point, the whole situation becomes more complicated when the devotee sings the next line, Jai Prasad-e-Pure Sarva Asha, meaning that by Srila Prabhupada's song, all our desires for spiritual perfection will be fulfilled. So it is very clear that ISKCON GBC accepts that irrespective of who initiates the devotees in ISKCON, it is Srila Prabhupada who delivers the devotee from material existence. It is Srila Prabhupada who gives them Krishna and it is Srila Prabhupada who blesses them with spiritual perfection."

In the Krishna book, chapter 80, Srila Prabhupada says, there may be many spiritual masters who are initiated, but the initiator spiritual master is one. Initiator spiritual master is one, meaning life after life, he only is our Diksha Guru. No one else can be our Diksha Guru once we have taken initiation from a bona fide Diksha Guru. But in the Sri Guru Vandana, ISKCON devotees are mandated to sing daily that Srila Prabhupada is their eternal spiritual master, which is actually the point. This is the proposition of the Diksha Guru, not of just some pre-eminent Diksha Guru. Then why in the world is the GBC telling the devotees that they have to consider Srila Prabhupada as their eternal spiritual master, life after life, and not their so-called Diksha Guru?"

You see, and in a lecture given on July 9th, 1971, Srila Prabhupada said this. In the Vedic injunction, it is stated that in order to learn that transcendental science, one must have taught the Guru or the spiritual master. Without approaching a spiritual master, there is no possibility of attaining enlightenment. This is what the Vedic injunction says. You see, and in a lecture given on July 9th, 1971, Srila Prabhupada said this. You see, and in a lecture given on July 9th, 1991, Srila Prabhupada said this.

So, the spiritual master is the mercy incarnation of Krishna. Which spiritual master? Preeminent Shikshaguru or initiating Dikshaguru, initiating spiritual master?

Srila Prabhupada explains in Srimad Bhagavatam, canto 4, chapter 21, verse 31 purport, as Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions of a person, immediately, upon his surrender unto him. Similarly, the external manifestation of Krishna, the representative of Krishna, who acts as the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple, immediately after the disciple's initiation. So, it is the spiritual master who gives initiation to the disciple. So, it is the spiritual master who gives initiation to the disciple. The Dikshaguru, who is the mercy incarnation of Krishna.

Similarly, once more, the prayer here is seeking shelter at the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada. So, we had told you at the beginning that let us wait towards the end of this Sri Guru Vandana to understand what is this seeking the shelter of the lotus feet mean? In the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 4, Chapter 29, Verse 55, purport, Srila Prabhupada explains this. Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. Not only that, in the Nectar of Devotion, Chapter 6, Srila Prabhupada says, all together, Srila Rupa Goswami mentions twenty items and all of them are very important. Out of the twenty, the first three, namely accepting the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, taking initiation from him and serving him with respect and reverence are the most important. So, taking shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Prabhupada, haha means to take initiation from Srila Prabhupada.

And number six, to be the spiritual master for the disciple, to act as the manifestation of the mercy of Krishna. All these are functions of the diksha guru. And what does the GBC of ISKCON Mumbai group do? They have mandated that all the initiated devotees in ISKCON, irrespective of who their diksha guru is, they should sing daily to Srila Prabhupada all these aspects, which are meant actually for the diksha guru. And simultaneously, they have prohibited the disciples from singing the same thing to their so-called diksha gurus, except for one day in a year. And that too, optionally, not mandated. So actually, by the GBC's own rules and laws, Srila Prabhupada is acting as the diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON. And they are affirming that by singing Sri Guru Vandana for Srila Prabhupada day in and day out. Well, if Srila Prabhupada is performing the diksha guru for all the devotees in ISKCON, they are performing the all these functions of a diksha guru. Then, what are the unauthorized diksha gurus doing in ISKCON? What are they doing? What are their functions towards their disciples? What are their characteristics? Do they really do anything for their disciples at all? Or do they simply give a mala and a name in a ceremony and that's it? But that is what a Rithvik does, not what a diksha guru does. So, do the unauthorized gurus perform all these functions of a diksha guru? Match anything of what is sung about Srila Prabhupada daily in every ISKCON temple across the world by every ISKCON devotee. No matter who he has taken diksha from, whoever may"

      "transcript": "be his diksha guru, he has to sing this Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada. Well, the only thing that the GBC has ever said about its unauthorized gurus is in their resolution 409 of 2004, where they have said, When the GBC allows a devotee to take up the service of initiating, it does not thereby endorse him as an uttamaadhikari or pure devotee or certify his having achieved any specific state of realization. The GBC simply said in one line that none of the diksha gurus in ISKCON have any of the characteristics or perform the functions of a diksha guru. Whereas, all of those functions and characteristics are attributed to Srila Prabhupada by the GBC by asking all devotees to mandatorily, compulsorily sing Sri Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada daily without fail, irrespective of where they are, whether at temple or at home, you have to sing daily. And the GBC further, in resolution 409 of 2004, has informed all the devotees, saying that, Therefore, each prospective disciple, before initiation, should become familiar with the qualifications mentioned in Srila Prabhupada's books as those that a spiritual master ought to have, and decide for himself which senior devotee, if any, to approach for initiation. Within this context, the choice of whom to select as one's spiritual master is ultimately not that of the GBC. The GBC has also surfaced since the dawn of the GBC's failure to support the practice of possibility within the GBC. All devotees, including those who have not yet ascended into GBC, are gaining the knowledge of GBC and the GBC's that they have not yet attained connections to GBC. They have not yet become very familiar with the GBC or GBC model. Ultimately, the prospective disciple's own responsibility. So, every devotee in the ISKCON Mumbai group, it is your responsibility to determine whether the Diksha Guru in ISKCON is qualified to be a Diksha Guru or not. And well, if you, the devotees in ISKCON Mumbai group were to compare these two statements of the GBC with the position of Srila Prabhupada through the GBC authorized and mandated Sri Guru Vandana, then an intelligent devotee can only conclude that it is Srila Prabhupada alone in ISKCON who is actually the Diksha"

      "transcript": "Guru. Just take a look at this comparison table. Here we have in the first column, the functions and characteristics of Diksha Guru. So, the first point is that Srila Jeevagaswami in Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu says, Diksha Vidhanena Shri Guru Charana Sampaditam, receiving the grace of a bona fide spiritual Master through initiation. And in the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1, Chapter 1, verse 15 purport, Srila Prabhupada says, anyone therefore who takes shelter of the lotus feet of a pure devotee by accepting the pure devotee as his spiritual Master can be at once purified. So, in the Shri Guru Vandana that the devotees have to sing to Prabhupada, what do we sing? Shri Guru Charana Padma Kevala Bhakati Sadma. The lotus feet of the spiritual master are the abode of pure devotional service. So, this aptly fits Prabhupada according to this definition given by Sri Jiva Goswami and Srimad Bhagavatam. And so, Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling these functions and characteristics. And what about the unauthorized gurus as declared by the GBC? The answer is no, they don't perform this function because as per GBC Resolution 409 of 2004, they have declared that none of the Diksha Gurus in ISKCON are pure devotees or Uttama Adhikaris or have achieved any state of specific state of realization. So, they do not fit this characteristic. Then the next one, the Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 4, Chapter 29, Verse 55, purport, Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take shelter of him by initiation. And as far as Srila Prabhupada is concerned, every devotee has to sing every day, Vandho Mui Savadana Mate, I bow down to those lotus feet with great care and attention. And also, Haha Prabhu Koro Daya Deho More Padachaya. We have to sing to Prabhupada, O Master, be merciful unto me and give me the shade of your lotus feet. So, this condition is fulfilled by Srila Prabhupada. What about this function by the unauthorized Gurus? Well, they give Diksha. This much they do. Then in the Chaitanya Charita Amrita, Madhya Leela, Chapter 9, Verse 61, purport, It is the spiritual master who delivers the disciple from the clutches of Maya by initiating him into the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. So, how about Prabhupada, according to Sri Guru Vandana, Jahara Prasade Bhai Ebhava Toriyajai Krishna Prapti Hoi Jaha Hoite. It is through the grace of the spiritual master that we cross over this material existence and obtain Krishna. So, Srila Prabhupada fulfils this condition. What about the GBC appointed unauthorized Gurus? It is unclear about whether the Diksha Gurus perform this function or not. Because, some of the people say that it is the Diksha Guru who does it. Some of them say that it is Srila Prabhupada who does it. Some of them say that they don't know who is doing it. Some of them say it is Prabhupada, the Diksha Guru, the Shiksha Guru, the Temple President, the ISKCON as an institution, Prabhupada's books, everything put together who is delivering. So, it is unclear. They don't have a clear stand on this. Moreover, the GBC in their Resolution 409 of 2009, says that the Diksha Guru is the one who does it. So, it is unclear. They don't have a clear stand on this. Moreover, the GBC in their Resolution 409 of 2004 have also stated that none of the Diksha Gurus are pure devotees or Uttama Adhikaris or have achieved any specific state of realization. So, unless they are a pure devotee, they cannot deliver anyone. So, from that perspective, from that Resolution, the unauthorized Gurus in ISKCON are not delivering their disciples."

In his Bhakti Sandarbha, Divyam Janam Yathodadyat, Kuryat Papase Sankshayam, Tasma Diksheti Saproktah, Deshika is Tatva Kovidaihi. Diksha is the process by which one can awaken its transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of revealed scriptures knows this process as Diksha. And to Srila Prabhupada, we have to sing every day, Chakudan Dilojai, He has given me the gift of transcendental vision. And Divya Jnan Hriday Prakashito, by His mercy, divine knowledge is revealed within the heart. So Prabhupada is performing this function as per the GBC. As far as the unauthorized Gurus are concerned, no, they are not doing anything because they are not pure devotees, they are not uttama adhikaris, they have not achieved any specific state of realization as per the GBC Resolution of 409. Next, in the Krishna book, Chapter 80, Prabhupada says, there may be many spiritual masters who instruct. But the initiator spiritual master is one. And so, in the Sri Guru Vandana to Srila Prabhupada, we sing Janme Janme Prabhu Se, He is my spiritual master life after life. That means Srila Prabhupada is fulfilling this criteria that He is the only spiritual master for us eternally. And as per the GBC Resolution of 409, the spiritual masters are not pure devotees, they are not uttama adhikaris, they have not achieved any specific state of realization, they are silent. So, this is the answer to all the questions that we are getting on whether these unauthorized"

      "transcript": "Diksha Gurus are eternally the Diksha Gurus for their disciples or not. So, it is unclear. When it comes to the next point from the Srimad Bhagavatam, 4th Canto, 21st verse, Chapter 31 purport, as Krishna takes away all the sinful reactions of a person immediately upon his surrender unto Him, similarly, the external manifestation of Krishna, the representative personality of Godhead takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple immediately after the disciple's initiation. And in the Sri Guru Vandana, the devotee has to sing to Srila Prabhupada, Sri Guru Karuna Sindhu, Adama Janara Bandhu. The spiritual master is an ocean of mercy, the friend of the poor. So, Prabhupada is the mercy incarnation of Krishna and it fulfils this criterion. And as far as the GBC is concerned, they have said that the gurus, the diksha gurus in ISKCON are not pure devotees. They don't have any specific state of realization. So, are they taking the sinful reactions of the disciples? It is unclear. They are saying that some of the diksha gurus, they claim that they are taking it. Some of the diksha gurus are claiming it is Prabhupada who takes. Some of them say that how can we burden Srila Prabhupada with the sins of our disciples and all kinds of opinions exist in ISKCON on this front. And so, it is unclear who is taking the sinful reactions of the disciples. So, when we look at this table, there is only one positive thing that the unauthorized diksha gurus in ISKCON are doing. What is it? They are giving diksha. So, apart from giving so-called diksha, what are the diksha gurus in ISKCON doing? There may be 100 plus devotees calling themselves diksha gurus, but none of them perform any of the functions of a diksha guru described in Sri Guru Vandana sung for Srila Prabhupada daily. And nor do any of them fulfill any of the quotes of Srila Prabhupada on diksha guru on initiating guru. So, ultimately, even if you go by these GBC resolutions, an intelligent and well-informed devotee can come to only one conclusion. And what is that? That Srila Prabhupada is the sole Diksha Guru for ISKCON. And that is what Srila Prabhupada too confirmed in the July 9th, 1977 order to all temple presidents and GBCs that he is the spiritual master, he is the Diksha Guru and everybody who takes initiation in ISKCON are his disciples even after his disappearance. So, without getting confused, please follow the July 9th order of Srila Prabhupada implementing the Ritvik system of initiations in ISKCON and accept Srila Prabhupada as the sole Diksha Guru in ISKCON through this Ritvik system of initiations and do not be misled by the unauthorized Guru system in ISKCON. Hare Krishna, Vishwa Guru, Srila Prabhupada ki Jai."
