In this session, we will be discussing from the 7th and 8th verses of the 19th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The 7th verse first: Munivrata Mukta Samastha Sangaha. The meaning of this verse is: Thus the king, the worthy descendant of the Pandavas, decided once and for all and sat on the Ganges bank to fast until death and give himself up to the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, who alone is able to award liberation. So, freeing himself from all kinds of associations and attachments, he accepted the vows of a sage. There are many, many points in this verse. The verse itself is very nicely describing Pariksit renouncing his kingdom and deciding to prepare himself to quit his body within a week by fixing his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krishna. Why did he choose to fix his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krishna? Because Krishna alone can award liberation. That's why Krishna's another name is Munivrata. That's why Krishna's another name is Mukunda, one who can give Mukti, liberation. Even Lord Shiva admits, nobody else can give liberation. Mukti Pradata Sarveshaam Vishnureva Nasamshayaha. Shiva says nobody else can give liberation other than Vishnu. So Vishnu, Krishna, only they can give liberation. That is the supreme personality of Godhead. And in order to become liberated, one has to become free from all kinds of material association and material attachments. So Pariksit prepared himself by giving up all kinds of material association and material attachments."

      "transcript": "So, in the Sixth verse, Shrila Prabhupad explains the significance of Pariksit Maharaj retiring and going to a holy place on the bank of the sacred river Ganga. Shrila Prabhupada says in the Sixth verse, \"The water of the Ganges sanctifies all the three worlds including the gods and the demigods because it emanates from the lotus feet, the personality of Godhead Vishnu.\" Lord Krishna is the fountainhead of the principle of Vishnu tattva, and therefore shelter of his lotus feet can deliver one from all sins including an offense committed by a king unto a Brahmana. Now here Srila Prabhupada explains what's the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu, actually they are one person called the principle of Vishnu tattva. You should understand that the supreme personality of Godhead Krishna is an unlimited personality, so he is not limited to one form. His original form is that of Krishna and he has many, many, many countless other forms which are forms of his own personality, like the form of Vishnu in this material world or the form of Narayana in the spiritual world or the form of Balarama, form of Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Keshava, Madhava, Govinda, unlimited forms because he is unlimited personality. He has unlimited forms, he is unlimited, but one should not mistake the form of the living being to be the form of the Lord, no, the form of the living being is never the form of the Lord. The living being is a very, very, very, very, very tiny living being, Anu Atma, and Krishna is Vibhu Atma. He is unlimited. He is a super soul and we are all individual, tiny, very, very infinitesimal spirit soul. So there is a difference. Both are spiritual by nature, the living entity and the Supreme Lord, but the Supreme Lord is unlimited person and we are limited, very, very, very, very tiny like comparing an atom to diamond. The whole universe, it's like that, the difference is like that. We can't measure how big is this universe. It's billions and trillions of times the size of an atom. So the living entity should never be equalized or even compared with the Supreme. So, Krishna is the fountainhead of the principle of Vishnu Tattva means Krishna is the source of all other incarnations, all other forms of the Supreme Lord. From Krishna emanate Narayana, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Vasudeva, Vishnu, and Vishnu. There are three forms of the Supreme. Keshava, Madhava, Govinda, all the Vishnu forms, all the Narayana forms, emanate from Krishna. That's the meaning of Krishna telling in the Bhagavad Gita, Aham sarvasya prabhavo matta sarvam pravartate."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/qOOwbq9SZLc?t=479",
      "transcript": "So, it's said here, anyone who takes shelter of the lotus feet of Krishna becomes freed from all sins, including all offenses, accidentally committed, unknowingly committed, inadvertently committed. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, Maharaj Pariksit began to meditate upon the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, who is Mukunda, or the giver of liberation. Now, the bank of the Ganges or the bank of Yamuna can give a chance to a person to remember the Lord continuously. Therefore, Pariksit Maharaj decided to sit on the bank of the Ganga and meditate on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord Krishna to become free from all sins. Now, the eight words of the nineteenth chapter of the first canto, it is described. The meaning of this eighth verse is, at that time, when Pariksit Maharaj sat to fast until death, preparing himself for quitting the body, purifying himself, all the great minds and thinkers, accompanied by their disciples and sages, who could very sanctify a place of pilgrimage, just by their presence, they arrived there, where Pariksit Maharaj was sitting, for fasting and purifying himself. They arrived there on the plea of making a pilgrim's journey. Sushila Prabhupada explains this in the purport. When Maharaj Pariksit sat down on the bank of the Ganges, the news spread in all directions of the universe. It's a very, very, very great incident, because he was Hindu. He was a great devotee of the Lord. And he was the ideal emperor, ruling the whole earth planet. He was a very powerful king. He was a descendant of the Pandavas. Pandavas were pure devotees of Krishna. So was Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna, also a pure devotee of Krishna. So, when such a great personality dies, when such a great personality decides to renounce his kingdom, it is not a small incident. It even is important for the great personalities living in higher planets. The personalities of the higher planets know the aim of life is to purify oneself."

      "summary": "This segment explains why great sages visited Pariksit Maharaj, emphasizing their ability to purify places and their interest in hearing the Srimad Bhagavatam from Shukadeva Goswami.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/qOOwbq9SZLc?t=691",
      "transcript": "And to prepare oneself to go back to Godhead. All the great personalities know this, but they are unable to themselves engage in a specific activity for complete 100% purification, because among them, different sages have different understanding of what is the best means for attaining the absolute truth. Because to understand what is the absolute truth is not at all easy if one simply studies the Vedas. It becomes different kinds of spiritual practices. The absolute truth is the personality of Godhead Krishna and this can be realized only by those who follow the process of pure devotional service. Such pure devotees are very, very, very rare in this whole universe, including the upper planets, including Brahma Loka, Mahar Loka, Jana Loka, Tapo Loka, including the heavenly planets. It is very rare to find a 100% pure devotee like Pariksit Maharaj, or it is very rare to find a 100% pure devotee like Shukadev Goswami. So when they receive news, Pariksit Maharaj is preparing to quit his body, they actually came to meet Pariksit Maharaj. But when they were asked, where are you going? Where are you traveling? They made an excuse that we are going to a holy place to take a bath to become purified. But what is their qualification? They themselves are personalities who can purify a place by their presence. They don't require to become purified. Neither they require to take a bath in a holy place. No. So the significance of such great personalities visiting a holy place is also described by Prabhupada. The places of pilgrimage become overburdened with the sins of common people. The common people go to a place of pilgrimage, take a bath, and they leave behind all their sinful reactions. So as millions of people go, let's say, a Kumbha Mela, so many millions of people go there to purify themselves by taking a bath at the auspicious time in the holy place of Prayag, Prayag Raj. So they leave behind all their sinful reactions. The holy places become overburdened with these sinful reactions of common people. But when such sages who are very, very powerful personalities, they visit overburdened places of pilgrimage, they sanctify the holy places by their mere presence. So the sages who came there, they were not interested in their own purification. They were already pure, but they came there to meet Maharaj Pariksit who was a great personality. Now they could foresee, Prabhupada says, that the Srimad Bhagavatam would be spoken by Shukadeva Goswami. Therefore they came there to hear the Bhagavatam spoken by Shukadeva Goswami, which was going to be spoken by Shukadeva Goswami to Maharaj Pariksit. I'll stop here. Thank you very much."
