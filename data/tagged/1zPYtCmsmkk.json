      "transcript": "If somebody achieves the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, how will he receive it? Actually, Mahaprabhu bestows His mercy upon the devotees in three ways. The first way a devotee gets the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, very easily, is that all the material miseries are destroyed, and the person becomes purified. Transcendental ecstasy is awakened in his heart, a bliss is awakened in his heart, which covers up all the material miseries, and also all the material pleasures. The second manifestation of the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is, all the contradictions in the scriptures get reconciled, and you are able to understand what is the essence of the scriptures: Krishna is the Supreme Personality of God, and that firmly gets established in your heart. And not only that, what happens is, the transcendental mellows get revealed to us. The third aspect of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mercy is, He establishes inspiration to do devotional service with ecstasy and the appreciation of the conjugal pastimes of Krishna."
