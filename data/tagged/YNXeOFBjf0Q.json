But all the forms are identical with one another. This is difficult for us to conceive, that there is one person with many forms, all simultaneously existing and all identical with each other. The same person, but he is present as Rama, Narasimha, Varaha, Krishna, Matsya."

And while hearing, we try to keep aside all our material conceptions. Material conceptions of the form means, a form is a limitation. Transcendental form means there is no limitation. Transcendental form is the body. There is no limitation. So the form actually has got unlimited power, unlimited varieties, unlimited love, unlimited qualities. But still, the form is something which, when it is revealed, it becomes known to the devotee and it may appear like an ordinary form. Just like the form of Krishna. Now Krishna appears in Vrindavan like a cowherd boy. So, people may think, is this a form of God? Cowherd boy? Even big big devatas, including Brahma, they will doubt whether this is the form of God or it is the form of somebody else."

Brahma demonstrates his mystic power sometimes. No example you can think of. Of course, while testing Krishna, he used his mystic power. That you all know. But any other example? When Hiranyakashipu was doing tapasya, what did Brahma come and do? He sprinkled some water. Hiranyakashipu's body was eaten away by ants. It was reduced to bones. The skin, the flesh, everything was finished. Just he sprinkled some water and Hiranyakashipu's body became fully reconstructed. Full luster. So that is Brahma's mystic power. That is Brahma's mystic power. So Brahma gave Hiranyakashipu the boon that you will not die in the day or night. You cannot be killed by human. You cannot be killed by devata. You cannot be killed by asura. You cannot be killed by any insect or reptile or animal. So Hiranyakashipu became very, very, very, very powerful. So that is Brahma's mystic power. That is Brahma's mystic power. He is very, very powerful."

First he took away the karmas, which Krishna had brought for grazing. Along with the karmas he also brought karmas for grazing. And they were a big number. They were not small numbers. Very big number. Number is not mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. They were a very big number. In Jetani Jetanatha I have made an idea of number. I will tell that later. So Brahma used his mystic power. And while Krishna was enjoying his lunch with the other covered boys, that time Brahma took away the karmas. He stole them. And suddenly one of the covered boys is seeing, Oh, the karmas are not there. Where has it gone? Not even one is visible. So they all started dying. So Krishna knows what is happening. But just to play along with Brahma, Krishna said, told the covered boys, Don't worry. You continue eating your lunch. I will just go look around and bring them back. They just strayed away. This is gone away. Looking for some fresh grass here and there. This is gone away. So Krishna went away, apparently in searching the karmas. Meantime, when Krishna had gone away, Brahma came a second time and took away the covered boys. What did Brahma do? He put those karmas into a sleeping condition and took them away. Next he put the boys into a sleeping condition and took them away. And he is hiding them and coming back and seeing what is happening."

Not a small number. He is coming back and seeing all the covered boys and the karmas are as they are in Krishna. So Brahma is giving them away. He is using his mystic power to test Krishna. Brahma is giving them away. And he is trying to see whether the covered boys and karmas are the same or they are different. And Brahma is seeing they are the same, identical. So then he thought for a moment that Krishna has somehow done some other used some other mystic power and brought them back from where Brahma had hidden them. But actually Brahma could see that there are two sets. Not one set. Two sets of covered boys and karmas. All identical. So he has hidden them. They are there. And here Krishna is also hiding. So how is this possible? Brahma is thinking how is it possible? And not only that because a yogi can expand himself into some other forms up to nine or ten forms. And all forms will look identical to the yogi. But the yogi's mystic power is such that if in one form he lifts his hand all the nine forms the hand will lift it. It's like television screen. There are multiple screens. In the studio like telecast is going on in the studio one actor's person is lifting the hand. In the television screen same action will happen. Correct? All the television screens same action will happen. No independence. Similarly yogi when he expands all the forms will be doing the same action. These are the children they call for independence they march the drill. Everybody will do like this. Like this. Like this. The drill master will keep like this. One, two, three, four. Something like this. They all lift their hands. Correct? Identically. Looks very nice. So like that a yogi cannot independently do different things in different forms."

So the cowherd boys are playing with Krishna. The cows are there grazing on the field in the forest and they are all independently doing their own thing. Not all are same action. No. So they are Brahma realists. No. This is not the power of a yogi that this cowherd boy is displaying. He is actually my master. Yogeshwara Krishna. He is Yogeshwara Krishna master. So he is able to display this power which is not possible for any yogi. It's not possible even for me. So he is Krishna. He is God. So Brahma would understand that here is God after testing using his own instinct. So that's the nature of Krishna's form. He can expand and each form can be different and each form can act independently and all forms are actually Krishna only. Now to prove to Brahma that these are forms of Krishna's own forms what happened? After some time Brahma was watching. Krishna turned into four handed Narayana form. All the cowherd boys and calves became four handed Narayana form. And that is when Brahma got the confirmation Oh! Krishna has expanded. While I am hiding the cowherd boys and calves in my place Krishna has expanded. So from this we can understand Krishna's form."

      "transcript": "What is Krishna's form? Some idea we can get. Even when Krishna showed universal form to Arjuna Bhagavad Gita has a description. You should read that description. The whole universe entire universe is actually one of the forms of Krishna. One of the forms of Krishna whole universe itself. So that form Arjuna could see sitting in one place because the universe is so big. How can you see the whole universe sitting in one place? Sitting on the chariot Arjuna was able to see the universal form of Krishna. So for that Krishna had given special vision and Krishna helped Arjuna to see that form. Arjuna could see that universal form. Then Krishna showed Arjuna that universal form transformed into four handed form. Dharayana form. Then again that four handed form transformed into Krishna's own form two handed form. So all these forms Arjuna was able to see because Krishna has unlimited forms and he is the same person and all these forms are Krishna's forms only. All these forms are Krishna's forms only. Now when somebody sees the form of Krishna generally a person who sees the form of Krishna thinks that this form is an unlimited form. Just like when Krishna was present 5000 years ago. Like Brahma thought he is an ordinary cardboard boy. Not only Brahma practically everybody used to take that form of Krishna as an ordinary form. Very few people knew that this form of Krishna is actually the form of God or Krishna is God."

      "transcript": "Very few people knew that. Most people did not know that. So even if you see Krishna's form even if you see God's form you will see the way you are seeing here of Krishna and Dharna. Being a Krishna and Dharna what do people think? Statue made of metal. They think it is a statue made of metal and devotees have never heard of it. The statue. But this is not a statue. It is actually Sakshat Bhagwan Krishna. Now how can we understand how can we realize this form actually is not a statue. The same way how Brahma can realize the form of Krishna or Krishna. It is not an ordinary form. How Brahma can realize? When Krishna gives the realization out of Krishna's own mercy. When Vishnu or Krishna out of their mercy they reveal to Brahma they reveal to a devotee they give the realization about the transcendental nature of Brahma. Then only it is possible otherwise not possible. So if you also want to see Krishna or you want to realize this form as spiritual form you should actually become a devotee. You should practice Bhakti and that Bhakti should be such that you should please Krishna by your devotion. There is a certain amount of personal relationship involved in this. Personal relationship."

      "transcript": "It is like in ordinary beings also we try to please a person. Especially mother tries to please the child or husband tries to please the wife. Right? It is more than just simply some activity or some relationship. It is more than that. So what is that special thing about trying to please another person? It is love. That is what we call love. So if there is love a loving relationship in which one is trying to please the other then there is possibility that the other person will reciprocate. And in that reciprocation there is no consideration of who is greater who is smaller who is demanding what. There is no such consideration. There is no calculation being done. There is no mother loves her child. The mother will take care of the child. The child will pass through a neuron. The mother will not think why I should clean? Stupid child. There is no business. Whole day only eating, sleeping, passing urine, passing stool. That's all. What does the child do whole day? Especially small child. Put him there. What does he do? Only do this business. Mother keeps on. Never counts how many times I have done. How long I have to do this. Mother never thinks. So, like that Prabhupada explains when a devotee develops love for Krishna in a loving relationship devotee is prepared to do anything for Krishna in order to please Krishna. And Krishna reciprocally is ready to do anything for a devotee to please the devotee."

The beginning Brahma did not know who He is where has He come from what is the purpose of His existence He didn't know anything. So, He was directed by Vishnu to perform His tapasya and He did that tapasya very very very long time very severe and then when Vishnu was pleased then Vishnu gave Him the realization and Brahma became realized and Brahma became realized so that knowledge Brahma got the realization by the mercy of Vishnu after Brahma performed tapasya then Brahma actually got the power the knowledge the skill yana bala priya everything to create this whole universe and Brahma also got the knowledge Brahma also after creating He handed down that knowledge that is called parampara system of receiving this transcendental knowledge especially this knowledge about the personality of God especially this knowledge also the other knowledge all other knowledge but especially this transcendental and for receiving the personality of Godhead there is no other way other than receiving this knowledge in parampara system."

I think Shri Krishna Goswami realized Brahma before. But still, he attained perfection by speaking. The Bhagavad Gita, the Parishad Maharaj has. Who is famous for having realized Krishna by remembering? Prahlad Maharaj, simply by remembering he realized God. Then, serving the Lotus Feet, Lakshmi. Lakshmi is always engaged in serving the Lotus Feet of the Supreme God. But her realization of God came about by the same method, same process. Simply by... Serving the Lotus Feet of the Lord with devotion."

      "transcript": "Then, Shravanam Keetanam, Vandanaam. Vandanaam means offering prayers. Who realized God by offering prayers? Akruda. Simply he offered prayers to Krishna. And he realized Krishna. Dasyam. Dasyam. Hanuman. Simply by acting as the Lord's servant. Lord Ram is known as servant. There are so many Masters who are servants. But that type of servant is not going to help you. Because they are not rendering service. They are not rendering service with devotion. In this world, so many Masters and so many servants. Some of them say, oh, very faithful servant. But still, it is not having devotion. So with devotion, how to serve? As a servant of the Lord, of Krishna, the Supreme Lord. That you have to learn from Hanuman. How to hear? You have to learn from Parishad. How to serve the lotus feet? You have to learn from Prajnini. So like this, Bhagavatam process especially is expressed in the Bhagavatam. You should hear the devotion. All the things here is the easiest. Other things are not so easy. Remembering, serving the lotus feet, acting as the servant of the Lord like Hanuman did. All that, not easy. Hearing is the easiest. It doesn't require any qualification."

      "transcript": "The special thing about hearing is, it doesn't require any qualification. Will I read? Anything else requires qualification. You have to speak, or you have to serve the lotus feet, or you have to remember. It requires qualification. Whereas hearing is the only thing among the nine processes that does not require any qualification. But there is a quality to the hearing. The technique of hearing. And for that Bhagavatam says, even the technique of hearing, you develop by hearing only. Simply sit and hear, that's all. In the early days, Prabhupada was travelling. You forgot to put in the belt. Okay, two hours. I'll come close with this example. Prabhupada was travelling with some disciples. And it was Janmashtami. Early days. They were not observing him. Because the temple had not yet been started. So Prabhupada told the disciples, some few devotees, You simply hear, I will recite the tenth canto of the Bhagavatam, which describes specially the birth of Krishna. Because today is the Janmashtami, the birthday of Krishna, appearance and worship. So they were all hearing. They can't understand anything. Prabhupada is reading his answer. Prabhupada said, whether you understand or don't understand, simply by hearing, you get full spiritual benefit. You get full spiritual benefit. So, hearing doesn't require any qualification. You simply have to lend your ear. That's all. And whether you understand or don't understand, the spiritual benefit is there. And, in the beginning, maybe you don't understand. But as you go on hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing, everything will be understood. Everything will be revealed. Everything will be realized. It's just a question of time."

      "transcript": "Keep hearing. But, there is a warning given in the Bhagavatam. When you hear, don't speculate. Don't try to conceive within your material mind what is being described. Just like if it is described, Krishna is black complexion, dark complexion. Immediately, material world conception of dark is not beautiful. Material world, somebody's dark complexion, we say, generally, not beautiful. But, spiritual conception of beauty is different. It is not dependent on the color of the skin or the complexion of the body. As Prabhupada says here, some of the forms are blackish, some are whitish, some are reddish, some are yellowish. All of them are beautiful. All of them are supremely beautiful. So, that is spiritual complexion. It has no relationship with beauty. Immediately, certain complexion is same. Beautiful certain complexion is same, not beautiful. Spiritually, there is no such thing as not beautiful. All spiritual forms are beautiful. All spiritual forms are beautiful. Though there are different complexions. So, you should not speculate about the spiritual subject matter or what is being described. Simply hear as it is. And try to perceive this knowledge or hear without trying to conceive, without trying to speculate, without trying to guess, without trying to think what it could be like that we imagine. Don't hear. Don't speculate. Don't theorize. Don't compare. You can think materially. Now, the moment you hear something, you compare materially what it could be. All it will be experienced. So, this sort of hearing will actually help you to realize. So, let's stop here."
