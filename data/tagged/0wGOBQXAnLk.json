This festival is known as Paani Hati Festival because originally it happened in a small village called Paani Hati. This festival is also called Danda Mahotsav. Danda means a punishment, a festival of punishment."

There is a curtain of Yogamaya that is covering me.\" So Krishna, who is the supreme personality of God, who is the Param Sathya, who is the Param Tattva, and in this material world, all the living entities are in a spirit of independence from the Lord, don't want to surrender to the Lord, want to lead a life independent of the Lord. To them, the Lord is not revealed easily."

The Lord's prakasha tattva's function is to prakasha, to make, to illuminate, to reveal the truth to the living entities, to the living entities who are in ignorance. We are in such an ignorance, just like the sunshine thinking, \"I will be independent of the sun,\" most ridiculous, most impossible. That is our situation. To such ignorant living entities, to bring prakasha, to illuminate them, there is an expansion of the Lord, and that expansion of the Lord is Balaram. So Krishna is the original person, and Balaram is his immediate expansion, and he is prakasha tattva. Krishna is para tattva or bhagavat tattva, non-different. Krishna and Balaram, Krishna and Balaram, both are on the same spiritual absolute position, but Balaram is the one who reveals Krishna, and one who reveals to the living entities about all this is guru, and that guru is actually a representation of Balaram prakasha tattva. This is the understanding. The guru is someone who reveals Krishna. Guru is someone who gives Krishna to the forgetful living entities. So when Krishna came as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Balaram, the prakasha tattva of the Lord, came as"

Before he became a Goswami, before he came to that state, he was born into a very rich family in a place called Saptagram, and from a very young age, he had the great opportunity to see Chaitanya Mahaprabhu when he had just taken sanyas. When Chaitanya Mahaprabhu had taken sanyas, and he had a strong desire to come to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and he was making an attempt to come to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, but his family members, father, mother, would not allow him. They thought that, no, our son, because they came from a rich family, they thought their son, our son, should be like us. He should inherit all our property. He should inherit the position that we have, and he should be a normal worldly person. But he did not have any interest in the material activities. He wanted to be with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, serve the mission of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And so he would try to run away from home as a young boy, young man, and his father would send his guards and bring him back. So this happened many, many times, and every time Raghunath Das's father would bring him back. So Raghunath was very unhappy. He was longing to be with Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to serve his mission, be in his association."

Nithyananda Prabhu would be travelling around in Bengal broadcasting Krishna consciousness on the order of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So he came there, and he would do kirtans, he would tell about Krishna to people, and he had hundreds of associates with him, or thousands of associates with him. So Raghunath Das, when he heard that Nithyananda Prabhu has come to a neighboring village, he came to see him, and from a distance, out of humility, from a distance, he was offering his respects. But Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's associates, sorry, Nithyananda Prabhu's associates pointed out, \"Raghunath Das is there far away.\" So Nithyananda Prabhu wanted to bring him, so they sent message and Raghunath Das was brought. Nithyananda Prabhu was also, he had a sense of a very unique sense of humor, and so when Raghunath Das was brought close to him, Nithyananda Prabhu said, \"Raghunath, you are trying to hide from me,\" and Raghunath said, \"No, no, Prabhu, not at all.\" And then he said, \"I want to punish you today.\" Raghunath Das was very happy. Nithyananda Prabhu is going to punish me. So punishment from the Lord is very, from the master is very desirable because it's a form of mercy of the master. So Nithyananda Prabhu said, \"The punishment is, I know you are coming from a very rich family, you feed all my associates, and I have a special request, you should make cheetah dahi, flat rice mixed with yogurt, flat rice mixed with condensed milk, and two parts like this, you should distribute to everybody.\" So Raghunath Das was very happy"

Chaitanya Charitamruta says he mixed bananas and honey to all of this and served Nithyananda Prabhu and all the associates on the banks of Ganga. And at that time, Nithyananda Prabhu made a statement, \"We belong to the cowherd clan, and coming on a picnic like this on the bank of a river and having delicious food to eat is something that we love.\" Actually, this statement is significant because Nithyananda Prabhu is Balarama, and Krishna and Balarama and the cowherd boys would go on the banks of Yamuna and they would have their picnic everyday. All the things that their mothers had brought, had sent with them, they would share, called Vanabhoj. So that's what Nithyananda Prabhu was reminiscing. And at that time, Nithyananda Prabhu by his meditation brought Chaitanya Mahaprabhu there, and only a few fortunate souls, it is said, could see Chaitanya and Nithyananda, and there was ecstatic uproarious kirtan with Chaitanya and Nithyananda and chanting of the holy names which filled the air, and this Chiradahi which was given to Nithyananda and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was served to everyone. So this was a festival, and then towards the end of the festival, mystically Chaitanya Mahaprabhu vanished from the scene and only Nithyananda Prabhu and other associates were there."

So if we have to attain the lotus feet of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, service to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, we should get the blessings of Nithyananda Prabhu who is the Prakasha Tattva. So Raghunath Das received the mercy of Nithyananda Prabhu. To receive the mercy of Nithyananda Prabhu, we have to please him.
