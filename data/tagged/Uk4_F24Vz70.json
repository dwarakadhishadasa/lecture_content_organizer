Naratham Das Thakur sings, vrajendra nandana say sachi sutta haila say balram haila nithai. Vrajendra nandana is Lord Krishna, the master of Vraja, and sachi sutta refers to the son of Mother Sachi. So the same person who previously had been the darling of Vrindavana has now incarnated as Sri Chaitanya, the son of Sachi Mata. Similarly, the person who previously had been Lord Balaram has now appeared as Nithyananda Prabhu."

      "transcript": "So we saw the house where they were all staying after lunch this afternoon. According to hearsay, after his marriage, Lord Nithyananda had requested the local Zavindar here in Kardaha to kindly allot him a piece of land where he and his family could reside. The Zavindar, being unaware of Lord Nithyananda's divinity, rebuked him for abandoning his sanyasa and accepting a wife later on. The Zavindar, at the time of conversation, was fishing along with his friends. He sarcastically replied to Nithyananda that if he really needed a piece of land to stay, then he would have to create it out of water. Saying this, the zamindar threw a piece of burning straw into the Ganges in order to mark the place on water where the zamindar decided Lord Nithyananda should set up his residence, making fun of Lord Nithyananda Prabhu in front of his friends. Nithyananda Prabhu, who always remained very humble and without any anger, did not mind the zamindar's harsh words and assured the zamindar that whatever he had wished, though sarcastically, would surely come to pass. What happened next stunned all present. A huge mass of land suddenly appeared from the water exactly at the place where the burning piece of straw had hit it. Then this newly created island then got connected with the mainland. This place subsequently came to be known as Kardaha. Kar means straw in Bengali."

      "transcript": "His transcendental house is presently renovated all over the three worlds as Kunjavatika. There is a very sweet pastime that has been narrated in Abhirama Leelamrita which talks of Shri Abhirama Gopala Thakura's arrival in Kardaha. Shri Abhirama Gopal Thakur, one of the most prominent of the twelve cowherd boys, Dwaadasha Gopala, had a very powerful personality. He was a great friend of an intimate associate of Shri Nithyananda Prabhu. If Abhirama Thakur bowed down to any person who was not the Lord or empowered by the Lord, then that person would die immediately. Similarly, if he bowed down before any stone that was not a Saligramshila, then that stone would immediately crack. Several deities in Bengal had cracked just because Shri Abhirama had paid them his obeisances. All the previous seven sons of Nithyananda Prabhu had died because Sri Abhirama Thakur had paid them his dhandavats. However, when Sri Bhirachand Prabhu appeared in this world, Lord Nithya was very careful not to invite Sri Abhirama Gopal Thakur to attend his childbirth ceremony. He feared that Abhirama would again bow down and cause harm to the child. Though Lord Nithya was an expansion of the Supreme Lord, yet he played his part like a normal father and therefore expressed his concern and anguish. Nithyananda"

      "transcript": "Hence, he instructed all the boatsmen of Kardaha not to transport Abhirama Thakur to the other side of Ganges in case he was seen that day. Sri Abhirama Gopal was a covert boy of Vrindavan and he neither had any ego, nor did he care for any false prestige. In a very innocent mood, living behind all inhibitions, he set out for Kardaha without any invitation to meet his dear friend and bless his newborn. When Abhirama Thakur arrived on the bank of Ganges and asked the boatmen to carry him to Kardaha, the boatmen panicked. Running out of options, they drowned their boats in the water. But Abhirama then simply spread his grace and said, and then, sitting on that floating cloth, peacefully crossed over the river. Seeing his prowess, all the onlookers were amazed. When Abhirama finally arrived at Kunjavatika, Nithyananda Prabhu courteously embraced him and fed him sumptuously. Thereafter, in spite of Srimati Janava and Vasudha Devi's presence, Abhirama bowed down again and paid his obeisances to little Birchandra. When he saw that no harm was caused to the little child, he was overjoyed and composed verses glorifying him, understanding that he was the expansion of the Supreme Lord."

Sri Nithyananda Prabhu had performed the most amazing pastimes here in Kardaha, which cannot be completely described even with a thousand mouths. Such was his magnanimity, such was his mood, that he freely distributed the treasure of Lord's love. His uncommon, unique pastime moved even the atheist to cry tears of love. Lord Nithya was almost completely devoid of any external consciousness and remained intoxicated in an ecstatic love of God. In such a state of utter ecstasy, he would sometimes jump high up in the air or at other times roll over the ground while continuously glorifying the Supreme Lord. Sometimes he would laugh and at other times streams of tears would roll down his beautiful eyes. Srimati Janava Devi, Vasudha Devi, and Birchandra Prabhu have all manifested their sweet pastimes."
