      "summary": "The lecture begins with an introduction to verses 3 and 4 of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, focusing on Vidura's return to Hastinapura, the joy of the inhabitants, and the circumstances of Vidura's departure due to Duryodhana's insult and his own desire for spiritual advancement.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/58fbM0TAqxU?t=49",
      "transcript": "In this session, we will be discussing the third and fourth verses of the 13th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Since there is a long purport for these two verses given by Srila Prabhupada, we will discuss this in two parts. So this session will be discussing part one of the purport. The third and fourth verses are given together. I shall read them together. So the third and fourth verses are given together, their translation: \"When they saw Vidura return to the palace, all the inhabitants—Maharaj Yudhishthira, his younger brothers, Dhritarashtra, Satyaki, Sanjaya, Kripacharya, Kunti, Gandhari, Draupadi, Subhadra, Uttara, Kripi, many other wives of the Kauravas, and other ladies with children—all hurried to him in great delight. It so appeared that they had regained their consciousness after a long period.\" This indicates how dear Vidura was to all the inhabitants of the palace of Hastinapura. Foolishly, Duryodhana insulted Vidura, though Vidura was a well-wisher of Dhritarashtra and all the Kauravas. But Duryodhana, he very foolishly, in a narrow-minded way, he thought somehow that Vidura was against his real welfare, while the opposite was true. Vidura was actually advising Dhritarashtra for the well-being of Dhritarashtra and their entire family members, but Duryodhana thought otherwise. And when Duryodhana, out of foolishness, he insulted Vidura, Vidura left the palace and went away, not because exactly that he was insulted by Duryodhana, but because he was not interested in any material comforts or materialistic way of life. His interest was in Krishna consciousness, and he thought it wise to go on a pilgrimage and travel to holy places, searching for a suitable pure devotee of the Lord to hear Krishna katha and inquire about spirituality from such a bonafide, proper devotee. So it was described in the previous words that Vidura was on pilgrimage. He actually went searching for a pure devotee. He came in contact with Maitreya Muni. He inquired from Maitreya Muni, and after he got conviction that the ultimate goal is to be established in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Krishna, after that, he stopped putting questions to Maitreya and returned to Hastinapura."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/58fbM0TAqxU?t=302",
      "transcript": "Now, what are the purpose of return to Hastinapura? That will be made clear in the next few verses. But here, when he returned, all the inhabitants of Hastinapura were not the same as he had been in the past. Also, that palace, Maharaj Yudhishthira, the brothers of Yudhishthira, Kunti, Gandhari, Draupadi, and so many other ladies with children, all of them, they were very, very joyful to receive him back after he had left and gone, means they were not happy that he left. Duryodhana foolishly insulted Vidura, but Vidura was actually a real well-wisher, and he was very dear to all the other members of the family. So they all felt great delight when Vidura returned, and they went to receive him, and they were appearing to have regained their consciousness after a long time. It appeared like that they were so happy, so joyful. So Srila Prabhupada in the Purport describes the four different personalities mentioned in this verse: the brief history of Gandhari, Kunti, Draupadi, and Subhadra. These four personalities' history, brief history, is given by Srila Prabhupada in the Purport."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/58fbM0TAqxU?t=393",
      "transcript": "So first of all, Prabhupada describes the history of Gandhari. Gandhari is the mother of the Kauravas. She is the wife of Dhritarashtra, and she is being described here by Srila Prabhupada, \"the ideal chaste lady in the history of the world.\" Such a glorious description of Gandhari, \"ideal chaste lady.\" Now, why she is described in this way will be very clear in the later parts of this description. She was the daughter of Maharaj Subala, the king of Gandhara. Now, this Gandhara is known as Kandahar in Kabul, Afghanistan. And in her maiden state, Gandhari worshipped Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is generally worshipped by Hindu maidens to get a good husband. Gandhari satisfied Lord Shiva, and by his benediction, to obtain 100 sons, she was betrothed to Dhritarashtra despite his being blind forever. Dhritarashtra was very powerful Kshatriya, but he had that blindness from birth. He was born blind. When Gandhari came to know that her would-be husband was a blind man, to follow her life companion, she decided to become voluntarily blind. These are the characteristics of a chaste lady, a chaste wife. She voluntarily decided to become blind. So what did she do? She wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens, and she was married to Dhritarashtra under the guidance of her elder brother Shakuni. She was the most beautiful girl of her time, and she was equally qualified by her womanly qualities, which endeared every member of the Kaurava court. Despite all her good qualities, she had the natural frailties of a woman."

      "summary": "The segment continues Gandhari's story, describing her envy of Kunti, the miraculous birth of her 100 sons, her disapproval of the Kurukshetra War, and her attempts to advise Dhritarashtra.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/58fbM0TAqxU?t=538",
      "transcript": "And she was envious of Kunti when the latter gave birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnant, but Kunti first gave birth to a male child. Thus, Gandhari became angry and gave a blow to her own abdomen. As a result, she gave birth to a lump of flesh only. But since she was a devotee of Vyasadeva, by the instruction of Vyasadeva, the lump was divided into 100 parts, and each part gradually developed to become a male child. Thus, her ambition to become the mother of 100 sons was fulfilled, and she began to nourish all the children according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of the battle of Kurukshetra was going on, she was not in favor of fighting with the Pandavas. Rather, she blamed Dhritarashtra, her husband, for such a fratricidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two parts from the sons of Pandu and her own sons. She was very affected by this when all her sons died in the battle of Kurukshetra, and she wanted to curse Bhishmadeva and Yudhishthira, but she was checked by Vyasadeva. So you can understand, she is a very chaste lady. She is very faithful to her husband, but still she advised based on proper religious principles, and she actually felt grief when she lost all her 100 sons in the battle of Kurukshetra. Her mourning over the death of Duryodhana and Dushasana before Lord Krishna was very pitiful, and Lord Krishna pacified her by transcendental messages."

That is the only way one can become pacified. Further, it is described by Srila Prabhupada, she was equally grieved on the death of Karna, and she described to Lord Krishna the lamentation of Karna's wife. She was pacified by Shri Vyasadeva when he showed her dead sons, then promoted to the heavenly kingdom. She died along with her husband in the jungles of the Himalayas near the mouth of the Ganges. She burned in a forest fire. Maharaj Yudhishthira performed the death ceremony of his uncle and aunt. Then Srila Prabhupada describes Kunti Devi's brief history."

      "transcript": "Kunti Devi was born as the daughter of Maharaj Shurasena, and she was a sister of Vasudeva. Vasudeva was Lord Krishna's father. Later, Kunti was adopted by Maharaj Kunti Bhoja, and hence she is known as Kunti. She was born as the daughter of Maharaj Shurasena, but she was adopted by Kunti Bhoja, and therefore she is called Kunti. She is the incarnation of the success potency of the personality. You got it. The heavenly denizens used from the upper planets used to visit the palace of King Kunti Bhoja, and Kunti was engaged for their reception. In former times, people were very pious, that the pious people of the earth were very strict in following all the rules and regulations, so they were visited by the devatas, and devatas were visible on this earth planet whenever they used to visit here because people were pious. In Kali Yuga, because of the sinful activities having increased too much, we cannot see the devatas even when they come to this material world. Now, whenever these heavenly denizens used to visit King Kunti Bhoja's palace, Kunti was engaged for their reception. She also happened to serve the great mystic sage Durvasa Muni, and being satisfied by her faithful service, Durvasa Muni gave her a mantra by which it was possible for her to call any devata she pleased. As a matter of inquisitiveness, she at once called for the sun god Suryadeva. Now, this Suryadeva, when he was called, he immediately desired couplement with her, but she declined. But the sun god assured her that she would be not adulterated, her virginity would not be adulterated, that she would be given immunity from the adulteration of her virginity. So she agreed to that proposal. As a result of this couplement, she became pregnant, and Karna was born by her. This is before her marriage to Pandu. So by the grace of the sun, she again turned into a virgin girl, but being afraid of her parents, she quitted the newly born child Karna. After that, when she actually selected her own husband, she preferred Pandu to be her husband."

So there is more description which we will continue to discuss in the next session. I will stop here. Thank you very much."
