      "transcript": "In this session, we will be discussing from the 18th verse of the 6th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: रूपं भगवतो यत्तन मनकान्तं शुचापहं अपश्यन सहत सोतस्थे वैक्लव्या दुर्मना इवा. The meaning of this verse is: \"The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire and at once erases all mental incongruities. Upon losing that form, I suddenly got up, being perturbed, as is usual, when one loses that which is desirable.\" So, Srila Nargumuni is explaining his experience to Vyasa Deva from his previous life. He began meditation. He had a glimpse of the Lord, and he became overjoyed with ecstasy. Suddenly, he lost that form. So then, after losing sight of that form, after getting a brief glimpse of darshan of that form of the Lord in the heart, Nargumuni is describing what was the kind of loss that he really felt when he lost sight of the Lord. The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire. The mind is the center of all the senses, and the mind is driving the senses towards sense objects, looking for something. What is that something that each one of us is looking for? It is actually Krishna. Everyone is looking for Krishna, having forgotten Him, and also desiring to get back that which we have lost. The most desirable, the most beautiful, the most wonderful, the dear most, the dearest, we have lost that, so we are looking for that. So therefore, when we actually get darshan of the transcendental form of the Lord, then immediately our mind's desire is completely satisfied. And also, all the mental incongruities are erased, means in the mind we settle for something when we don't get what we are really looking for, and we think maybe this can satisfy me, but then we find something else which may be relatively either better or more beautiful or more pleasing for the mind, again it creates in the mind a kind of complex situation that maybe this is what I was looking for, no no no, this is not what I was looking for. So there are so many mental incongruities essentially established through contact with so many other forms other than the form of the Lord, so all these incongruities in the mind are completely erased when we actually get darshan of the form of the Lord."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/xoI1iFCIR8g?t=304",
      "transcript": "And that's what Narad Muni is describing here. So he says, \"I lost that form which was completely satisfying to my mind, which erased the form of the Lord, which erased all my mental incongruities, that form I lost.\" And suddenly, on losing the form, all of a sudden I lost that form, then I became very much perturbed in my mind, and that is to be expected because when somebody loses something which is very, very desirable, then how do they feel? That's how I felt. So, Shrila Prabhupada makes a very important point in the purport here that the Lord is not formless, is experienced by Narad Muni. A widely prevalent understanding about God is that God is formless, Nirakar. Nirakar is one of the terms that is used to describe God. It is one of the terms that is used to describe the Lord's features, but we should carefully understand what this Nirakar means. Nirakar means the Lord does not have a material form. He doesn't have a form made of flesh and blood and skin and bones. No, He doesn't have such a form. He has a transcendental form. He has a completely spiritual form. That form cannot be seen with these ordinary eyes. These eyes are suitable only for seeing some material forms. Even material forms which are very big we cannot see. Material forms which are too close to the eye we cannot see. We cannot see even our own eyelids. We can't see something very small. We can't see if there is no light to see a particular object or a form. So, these eyes have got limitations. In any case, even if we overcome all kinds of limitations of this eye by some mechanical means, material means, still, spiritual form can never be seen by any material adjustment even for these eyes. You cannot see spiritual form with material vision, even making adjustments."

      "transcript": "Not possible. So, here Srila Prabhupada is telling Narada Muni's experience of seeing the form of the Lord, is that Narada Muni is able to see the transcendental form of the Lord by his spiritual endeavor, by his spiritual efforts, not by any material efforts. But his form is completely different from all forms of our material experience. This is an important point. What Narada Muni saw was not just another experience of seeing a material form. It's not that. It is completely different. So, Srila Prabhupada explains, for the whole duration of our life, we go see different forms in the material world, but none of them is just apt to satisfy the mind, nor can any one of them vanish all perturbance of the mind. Two things Prabhupada is mentioning: none of them can satisfy the mind. No material form can satisfy the mind completely. And none of the material forms have got the power to erase all mental incongruities. That's not possible. So, therefore, what is mentioned by Narada Muni in this verse is very important to note. These are the special features of the transcendental form of the Lord. The transcendental form of the Lord is distinctly different from all material forms, and the special features are being mentioned specifically by Narada Muni, that it completely satisfies the mind. Vision of the transcendental form of the Lord completely satisfies the mind, and it erases all mental incongruities. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, one who has once seen that form is not satisfied with anything else. This is a fact. Having seen the transcendental form of the Lord even once, for a brief moment even, then one can never be satisfied with any other form."

      "transcript": "The Lord is formless or impersonal means that He has nothing like a material form. This is again being stressed, that Nirakar means the Lord does not have a material form. Even descriptions of Lord being impersonal means He doesn't have a material personality. Now, Srila Prabhupada is also explaining in the purport, as spiritual beings having eternal relations with that transcendental form of the Lord, we are life after life searching after that form of the Lord, and we are not satisfied by any other form of material appeasement. See, this is a secret being revealed by Prabhupada based on Narad Muni's statement, that we are always looking, we are searching. But what are we searching? We are searching for the spiritual form of the Supreme Lord. Only that can satisfy our mind. Only that can give us the real joy that we are looking for. Narad Muni got a glimpse of this, but having not seen it again, he became perturbed and stood up all of a sudden to search it out. See, he got a glimpse, and he lost it, so he stood up all of a sudden. He was sitting and doing meditation. He stood up, and he began to search out, where did I lose, how did I lose sight of that beautiful transcendental form of the Lord?"

For the soul, for the real you or real I or real person, there is no death, there is no birth. So our real nature is spiritual, but we keep changing bodies. As long as we don't realize our self, we don't realize the Supreme Lord Krishna, and our relationship with Him, as long as we don't realize these three things, we keep taking birth again and again, simply quitting one body, entering another body. What kind of body? Material body. So that is what is being described here. What we desire life after life, if we remain spiritually ignorant, if we are not fortunate enough to come in touch with a pure devotee of Krishna, then we remain in ignorance. We simply are engaged in a hard struggle for existence. We keep searching for that spiritual form, transcendental form of the Supreme Lord, and none of the material forms..."

The deity is completely spiritual, but unless our eyes are trained, unless we have got spiritual training, unless we have developed the spiritual vision, we cannot see the spiritual form of the deity through our ordinary vision."
