They have assembled in that holy spot where Pariksit decided to sit down to fast until death, preparing for quitting his body to go back home, back to the environment, on the bank of the river Ganga, a holy place. These sages who were received very respectfully by Pariksit, it was, keep saying that, Maharaj, they have come from different parts of the universe and they are all very, very great saintly persons and they could foresee that the Srimad Bhagavatam is going to be spoken and therefore they have come here to listen to the Bhagavatam. And the purport Srila Prabhupada explains, beyond the limitation of the material creation which is compared to the cloud in the sky, there is the paravyoma or the spiritual sky full of planets called Vaikunthas. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam. In the Bhagavad Gita it is said by Krishna. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . changes in terms of creation, maintenance and destruction. Unlike material nature, there is another spiritual nature. That spiritual nature is beyond this material creation, beyond the material sky."

      "transcript": "So, Srila Prabhupada is quoting that Bhagavad Gita and telling beyond the limitation of the material creation. Material creation is limited even though in the material creation there are millions of universes and each universe has millions of planets, each planet has millions of living entities but still it is comparable to a cloud in the sky. It is like a sky is very vast but the cloud is just few hundred meters or at the most a few kilometers spread over the sky, vast sky, expanse of the sky. Similarly, there is the Paravyoma, the spiritual sky, Paravyoma. Vyoma means the sky and Paravyoma is the spiritual sky. Now, the spiritual sky is not known to everyone. Of course, the materialists have no conception of spiritual nature at all because they only accept what is perceivable by their gross senses. And some other materialists who may accept something about the mind. They may imagine something beyond what is grossly manifest. But the transcendentalists from the authoritative scriptures are aware of the spiritual nature. But even among the spiritualists, there is a spiritual nature. transcendentalists who are aware of the spiritual nature the impersonalists only know about the spiritual sky which is called paravyoma or brahma jyoti or brahman manifestation beyond the material creation but they do not know that the spiritual sky is full of planets called vaikunthas so the information or the reality of the truth about spiritual planets in the spiritual sky is known only to the devotees only to bhakti yogis the category of transcendentalist called"

      "transcript": "personalists or bhakti yogis or devotees such vaikuntha planets are also differently known as proper gives the names of different vaikuntha planets just like the material planets we have names like brahma loka mahar loka jana loka tapo loka satya bhu loka bhuvar loka atala sutala vitala talatala like that so vaikuntha planets also have different names such as purushottama loka achyuta loka trivikrama loka hrishi kesha loka kesava loka aniruddha loka mada loka pradyumna loka sankarshana loka mada loka sridhar loka vaikuntha contains the ultimate nirvana of all things good and evil the true and absolute truth of the whole world is that Shridhara Loka, Vasudeva Loka, Ayodhya Loka, Dwarka Loka and many other millions of spiritual Lokas. So the name of the Vaikuntha planet if it is say the name is Purushottama Loka because it is predominated by the Supreme Lord whose name is Purushottama. If the predominating deity of the Vaikuntha planet is Trivikrama that planet is called Trivikrama Loka. If the predominating deity is Vasudeva it is called Vasudeva Loka like that. Now Dwarka is... Krishna's own abode. Ayodhya is Lord Ramachandra's own abode. Like this there are many millions of spiritual Lokas wherein the personality of Godhead predominates. Unlike in the material world the different planets the predominating deities are different Devatas. So different Devatas are different. Different living beings. But in the spiritual world in the spiritual sky the spiritual planets are predominated by one person."

      "transcript": "One and only one Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now the Supreme Personality of Godhead himself even though he is one and only one person he expands himself in millions of forms each form having a different name. So according to the name of the particular form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the Loka also derives its name. Achyuta is one expansion of the Supreme Lord. So where Achyuta predominates that planet is called Achyuta Loka like that. Now the special thing about these planets is the spiritual planets is all the living entities there in the spiritual planets are liberated souls. They are all liberated souls. And in the material world in the material planets in the material universes all are conditioned souls. You see the difference. Here anybody who is taking birth in this material world with a material body is a conditioned soul. The liberated souls never accept a material body. They live in the spiritual planets Vaikuntha Lokas. They live with spiritual bodies as good as that of the Lord. The Lord has a spiritual body. He never comes in touch with matter. He never has any material contact or material body never. So just like the Lord the living entities also there are liberated souls with spiritual bodies as good as that of the Lord. There is no material contamination. We are just come. Everything there is spiritual. And therefore there is nothing objectively lamentable. Vishokam. They are full of transcendental bliss and are without birth, death, old age and disease. See the material world is characterized by these four defects. Janmamrtyu, Jaravyadhi, Dukha, Doshanu, Darshanam. That is a description of the material world. The spiritual world in the spiritual planets there is no birth, no death, no disease, no old age."

      "transcript": "Amongst all the above mentioned Vaikuntha Lokas there is one supreme Loka called Goloka Vrindavana, which is the abode of the Lord Shri Krishna and his specific associates. Maharaj Pariksit was destined to achieve this particular Loka, Shri Krishna Loka or Goloka Vrindavana. And the great rishis assembled there could foresee this. All of them consulted among themselves about the great departure of the great king, and they wanted to see him up to the last moment, because they would no more be able to see such a great devotee of the Lord. The 22nd verse: Ashutyata Drishiganavaca Pariksit Samam Madhuchad Guru Chavyalikam Abhashata Enan Abhinandya Yuktaan Shushrusha Manah Charitani Vishnu. The meaning of this verse is, \"All that was spoken by the great sages was very sweet to hear, full of meaning and appropriately presented as perfectly true.\" They have very great personality, so when they speak, it is very, very pleasing to the ears, and it is full of meaning. When they speak it is very, very pleasing, so it is full of meaning, and appropriately presented as perfectly true. They are above illusion. They are liberated souls, so when they speak everything is perfectly true. So after hearing them, Maharaj Pariksit, desiring to hear of the activities of Lord Shri Krishna, the personality of God had congratulated the great sages. So Maharaj Pariksit congratulated the great sages. This is Pariksit's reaction. When the sages spoke something, what was his reaction? So that we describe what Pariksit's reaction was in the next verse. I will stop here. Thank you very much."
