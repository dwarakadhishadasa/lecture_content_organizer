      "transcript": "Because he wanted to show off. So then he approached Varanadeva and he said, I heard you are very powerful, why don't you fight with me? So Varanadeva said, I am old, I am retired, please leave me Baba, don't fight with me, don't worry, soon there will come one person, Vishnu will come, he will take care of you. So from that time, he was searching, where is Vishnu? So when he came across finally Varanadeva, Vishnu in the form of Varanadeva, so he was thinking that, ah, I am so powerful, I will finish off this Vishnu also, what is this Vishnu in front of me? So until that point of time, nobody had dared to stand up and talk to him even. So when he approached Varanadeva and started insulting him, Varanadeva immediately gave it back to him. So he got angry, how can somebody talk to me like this? So, Shaila Prabhupada is saying here, the Bhagavatam is saying here, that in the purport, Shaila Prabhupada is saying, that a cobra may be very fierce for an ordinary person. Like I said, if a cobra were to enter into this room, what would happen? Everyone would start running here and there, right? No one will sit here. But if there is a snake charmer, among the monsters, what he will do, he will not fear, he will immediately take out his, whatever that he blows, and he will immediately start chanting his mantras and he will subdue the serpent. Simply catch it with his hand and he will take it and go away, isn't it? Just like in Vandavan, because we are in the midst of open fields, sometimes snakes come into our campus. So when snakes come, then all the staff, everybody starts running around and everybody is yelling and shouting and all that, and we get some snake charmer. So when the snake charmer comes, everybody tells him, see, it's there in that bush, it is sitting there. So he will go there, he will put his hand, take it and he will have a basket, he will put in that, he will take and he will go. And you pay him something for that. So snake charmer is not afraid of the snake. For him, what is there, it is a plaything. So similarly, Hiranyaksha, a demon, might sometimes become very powerful. He may become extremely powerful. Just like this Hiranyaksha, he is so powerful, even the devatas, none of the devatas were courageous enough to stand in front of him. Even Varanadeva said, no, I don't want to fight with you. So a demon may become so powerful, but in front of the Lord, in front of Vishnu, in front of Krishna, they are nothing. So Varahadeva is not perturbed by Hiranyaksha's strength or his power or his reputation."

And in fact, all power is coming from him. If the demon is powerful, where is that power coming from? Just like when Hiranyakashyapu, he was trying to kill Prahlad Maharaj, his own son, five-year-old son. He tried various means to kill him. Put him into a pit full of snakes, threw him down from the top of a cliff, tried to trample him with elephants, all of that failed. And when that failed, Hiranyakashyapu started getting afraid. And he questioned Prahlad Maharaj, where are you getting this power from? None of the devatas can stand in front of me, you are just a five-year-old kid, and all my attempts to kill you are failing. How have you become so much powerful? So Prahlad Maharaj replied, whatever is the source of your power is also the source of my power, which is Vishnu. So when he heard that, Hiranyakashyapu could not tolerate. That is how he said, where is your Vishnu, show me, is he in this pillar? And we know the rest, what happened. So, no matter how powerful a demon may become, for the Supreme Lord, he is nothing. And these demons, when they become powerful, they try to harass devotees. So sometimes devotees become perturbed that this demon is there, he is attacking, he is creating so much harassment for us. Just like Hiranyakashyapu, so much he harassed Prahlad Maharaj. And Prahlad Maharaj was very disturbed, but he pacified himself by remembering Vishnu and Krishna. By chanting Krishna's holy name, he managed to calm himself. So similarly, in all of our devotees' lives, there will be circumstances where we will see some demon become very powerful. And he will harass devotees. It may, the harassment may last for several years."

      "transcript": "But finally, when the Lord decides to vanquish him, then nobody can come in the way. In the purport, Srila Prabhupada is mentioning the pastime of Ravana. Ravana was another demon who was so powerful. He was so powerful that he wanted to build a staircase directly to heaven. He was thinking, what is all this Punya, Girnya and all you have to go to heaven? I will build one staircase, let everyone go. What, only devatas should enjoy heaven or what? So he started building a staircase to heaven. He was so powerful. And he was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. And because of pleasing Lord Shiva, he had become very powerful. So when the battle between Ravana and Lord Ramachandra was going on, the fight was raging. And on one side, Ravana, on the other side, Ramachandra. And arrows were being exchanged, weapons were being aimed at each other. The fight was going on. And one by one, slowly all of Ravana's weapons were getting destroyed. So his chariot got destroyed, his horses were destroyed, his charioteer was finished, his flag was cut off, everything was finished. And then his bow also broke. So then Ramachandra fixed his last bow, last arrow on his bow. And he aimed it at Ravana. And Ravana knew, this is the end. Now, I cannot protect myself. So he immediately remembered Lord Shiva. And he started calling out to Lord Shiva. Go Shiva, please protect me, please save me. So Lord Shiva was sitting in Kailasa, sitting with Parvati Devi. So Lord Shiva heard Ravana's cry. Ravana's cry reached up till there. But Lord Shiva was unmoved. He was silently sitting. So Parvati Devi, naturally because she is Lord Shiva's wife, so she has a... She has that little bit of familiarity with him. So she said, What is this you are sitting here, your devotee is crying. Go, do something. Just like wives will tell husbands, No, what useless fellow sitting there, do something. No, like that. No, like that Parvati Devi will tell, What is this you are sitting here, your devotee is crying. Why don't you go and do something? So Lord Shiva replied, Devi, what can I do? Supreme Lord Ramachandra has decided to kill him. What will I do going to there? The Lord has already decided, I cannot do anything, sorry. So Ravana was crying and crying for Lord Shiva's protection. But in the meantime, Ramachandra fixed his arrow, released it and Ravana was finished. So even Lord Shiva refused to protect Ravana because he knew that now that Ramachandra Bhagavan, he has decided to kill Ravana, even I cannot protect him. Srila Prabhupada used to often quote that saying, Rakhe Krishna Mareke, Mare Krishna Rakheke. Rakhe Krishna, if Krishna wants to protect someone, Mareke, who can kill him? Just like Krishna wanted to protect Prahlad Maharaj, even Hiranyakashipu could not do anything. And on the other hand, Mare Krishna, if Krishna wants to kill someone, just like Ramachandra decided to kill Ramana, Rakheke, who can protect that person?"

      "transcript": "Nobody can protect. So, the demons become very puffed up by their own power and strength, thinking that they are all powerful. But devotees, as devotees, we should not become puffed up whenever the Lord invests certain power in us for executing certain services. So as devotees, devotees are always humble and they know that the source of my strength and power is Krishna, is Vishnu. So they always treat that power which is invested in them by Krishna with lot of humility. Another thing that we can notice here is that Varahadeva also became angry and Hiranyakashipu also became angry. Both of them became angry. So what is the difference between the Lord and the demon? So the difference is that when the Lord becomes angry, his anger is for the welfare of the living entity. The Lord for the welfare of the demons, he becomes angry with them. So that by his anger, he can punish them and by that punishment they become purified of their offenses and they can become liberated. Whereas, the source of anger for the asuras, it's something else. Actually, Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, in the 62nd verse, 62nd and 63rd verse, Krishna explains what is the source of anger for the non-devotees. So Krishna says in the 62nd verse, ध्यायतो विषयान पुम्सा संगस्तेशु पजायते संगार्थ संजायते कामहा प्रोधो विजायते While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them and from such attachment, lust develops and from lust, anger arises. So the source of anger amongst non-devotees is the desire for sense gratification. So because of the desire for sense gratification, when a person contemplates on the objects of the senses, he develops attachment for them, he wants to fulfill his desire to gratify his senses. And then when he, and out of that and from such attachment, when he lusts after satisfying that desire, eventually that lust becomes frustrated. He is not able to fulfill that lust to the fullest extent. Then because of that frustration, anger arises."

      "transcript": "Now when a normal conditioned soul becomes angry, Krishna explains further in the next verse what actually further happens, what does that anger lead to? क्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोहाथ स्मुर्थि विभ्रमः स्मुर्थि ब्रंशाद् बुद्धि नाश्यो बुद्धि नाश्याद् प्रणश्यति From anger, delusion arises and from delusion, bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost. And when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool. So we can see here, Krishna is describing the danger of becoming subjugated by anger. Actually in fact, in the little previous to this, in the 58th verse, Krishna mentions यदा सम्हरते चायम कोर्मों गानेव सर्वशः इन्द्रियाणि इन्द्रियार्थेब्य स्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws his limbs within the shell, is to be understood as truly situated in knowledge. So Krishna in the 58th verse, he spoke about Dhamma, controlling the senses. That we all have to control our senses. The senses cannot be freely left to enjoy the sense objects. Now Dhamma entails gross control of the senses. Whereas in the 62nd and 63rd verse, Krishna is speaking actually of Shama, controlling the mind. One is the force of the senses, which impels us to enjoy the sense objects. And the second is the force of the mind. The mind generates certain desires. So if the mind is uncontrolled, then it finally leads to anger, and anger leads to further entanglement in this material world. So, Shama and Dhamma. Dhamma is important, Shama is also important. If we do not control our senses, if Dhamma is not practiced, Krishna says what happens in the 60th verse. He says, यततो ही अप्यकाऊंते ये पुरिशत्सि विपस्चिता इन्द्रियानि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसवं मनः The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavouring to control them. So even a knowledgeable person, even a person who is a person of discrimination, not an ordinary person, विपस्चिता a person of discrimination, a learned person, an intelligent person, a person who is a ज्यानी even such a person, if his senses are not controlled, what will happen? He will be led to destruction. So, one is दमा another is शमा as we read in the 62nd and 63rd verses, if a person does not practice शमा, he may very well control his senses, but then, if his mind is not controlled, then that will eventually again lead him to destruction."

      "transcript": "So both दमा and शमा are important. Now, in the case of devotees, what happens is दमा is very easily practiced. We follow the four regularity principles strictly, then automatically दमा is practiced. And, but then शमा is something which we consciously, we may miss out in practicing. दमा is very conscious, we will consciously follow. I should avoid onion, garlic, I should not eat meat, I should eat only कृष्ण प्रसादम, very easily we can follow. But शमा is something which many times may miss our attention, that we have to control the mind also. On one level, controlling the mind means we do not allow the mind to dwell on material sense objects. On a higher plane, दमा also means that we cannot allow the mind to think whatever it wants. Sometimes devotees get carried away, that no according to me it should be like this, according to me we should do like this. And then when things don't happen according to the way they are thinking, they become frustrated. And they start thinking, what is all this, I thought I came to devotional service thinking that everything will be nice here, but there are so many problems here, this is not okay, that is not okay. And finally the person will lose his interest in कृष्ण consciousness. So, in the case of devotees, we have to be very careful to practice this शमा, this control of the mind. Sometimes this uncontrolled mind will generate some thoughts which will seem almost like devotional service, it will look like devotional service only. Sometimes devotees think, no I should do something big for कृष्ण and we give them some service, what is this small service you are giving me, I want to do something big, give me some bigger service. So, actually if one has such a mentality, even if one becomes a PR devotee, one will not be able to have permanent residence in the spiritual world. One will have to keep coming back to that. One will have to keep coming back to the material world. Because if we have that desire, I should do something big for कृष्ण. कृष्ण will say, okay, you continue doing that in the material world, you be there and you keep doing big things. Such people will generally become देवताःs. They are pure devotees, but they become देवताःs because they have some desire to serve कृष्ण in some big capacity. So कृष्ण says, okay, remain in the material world and do big things. So, a devotee of the highest order, will generally, will not have this kind of thought. If we look at the ब्रजवासीs, why are they considered the topmost devotees, even above the देवताःs? Why? Because the ब्रजवासीs, they have no desire other than to please कृष्ण. If कृष्ण is pleased by my doing some small service, I will do that small service. I will be happy doing that small service. If कृष्ण wants me to do some big service, then I will do that big service. I am not attached to doing something big or small, I am attached to pleasing कृष्ण."

And then प्रभुपाद says, make me a success or a failure as you wish. You see, प्रभुपाद did not pray, कृष्ण I have come here to serve you, please make me a big success. प्रभुपाद is saying, make me a success or a failure as you wish.

It's not that we have to do something really big to satisfy प्रवुपा and कृष्ण. Even the smallest thing, just cleaning the floor, you do it nicely, it's enough. कृष्ण and प्रवुपा is pleased. If प्रवुपा and कृष्ण are pleased by my cleaning the floor, I'll keep cleaning the floor all throughout my life, no problem. This is the real mood of a devotee and one has to train one's mind to accept this mood and practice this mood. Otherwise mind always wants to do something which will gain lot of attention, lot of पूजा, प्रतिष्ठा, लाभा. So if I do some big service, many people will come and congratulate me, many people will come and praise me, that is very pleasing for me. Therefore I want to do big service. So the mind always tends towards these things. So actually in our condition stage, if we think that I want to do something big for कृष्ण, actually the motivation is not pleasing कृष्ण. The motivation is I want to do something big so that everybody will appreciate, people's attention will be there. Right now I am doing something nobody comes to know about it. What is this? I am going inside the अस्तन पुजार room, something I am scrubbing, nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody appreciates. So that's not the point. So we should be careful. So this will look almost like कृष्ण consciousness. We are serving कृष्ण only, what is wrong? But actually behind that there is another thing going. So we have to be careful about this, what we think, we have to control, we have to train the mind to be satisfied"

Actually कृष्ण explains in the third chapter of the बगवत गीता, I will read that verse. एस्तु आत्मरतिरैवस्यात् आत्मत्रप्तस्य मानवः आत्मसंतुष्टस्तस्य कार्यम्न विद्यते So for a person who is engaged in devotional service, what happens is we devotees, we do not practice any other duties that we are supposed to perform according to the Vedas. According to the Vedas we have so many रनाs to fulfill, रनाs to parents, रना to one's forefathers, रना to the देवता's, रना to the teachers, रना to the रिशी's, रना to the रिशी's, so many people, we have so many kinds of रनाs. But then what happens is we don't follow any of those, actually in Kali Yuga nobody follows any of those duties. Instead, it is said that in Kali Yuga we have to simply serve Krishna, right? Now if we don't perform our duties which are enjoined in the scriptures, actually one becomes liable to liable for the reactions to those sinful activities. It is considered a sinful activity not to perform one's duties. Now as devotees what happens is if we do not find full satisfaction in performing one's devotional service whatever is assigned to us, then actually we will also become liable for not performing those material duties. That is why Krishna says यस्त्वात्मरेतिरेवस्यात् आत्मत्रत्तस्यमानमः आत्मन्येवसंतुष्टस्तस्यकार्यम्नविद्यते कार्यम्नविद्यते means a person does not have to perform those duties. Who is the person who does not have to perform those duties? This is the seventeenth verses. One who is taking pleasure in the self, number one. Number two, one who is illumined in the self. And number third, one who rejoices in the self, number three, and is satisfied with the self only, fully satiated, for him there is no duty. So, until and unless we come to the point where one is completely satisfied in performing whatever duties are assigned to one by one spiritual master, then one cannot, until that point one cannot be free from the obligations to perform one's material duties. So as devotees we should train our mind to be satisfied, to take satisfaction only in performing the assigned duties to us in whatever service we are doing. If we are not feeling that satisfaction, then we have to understand that I am going to get the reaction for all, for not performing all my material duties."

So, if one practices controlling the mind in this fashion, if one practices Shama, then naturally one does not, one's mind will not try to find satisfaction in the sense objects. And when our mind is not engaged in trying to satisfying the sense objects, there is no question of frustration of one's attempts leading to Krodha or anger. And thus one can be safe from the dangerous effects of Krodha. So these are some of the points which we can glean from this. If there are any questions or comments,"

So how does the devotee who denies, discriminates the services, becomes a pure devotee? I didn't get the question. What was that? You said in the class, if a devotee is denying the menial services, want to do some big services, so in the future if he becomes a pure devotee also, he will become Devata in the material world. So how does a devotee who denies the, discriminates the services, and he can become a pure devotee? Well, the point is that, desiring to serve Krishna, in any way, is also devotional service only. It's not that it is not devotional service. If somebody desires, I should serve Krishna in some big way, it is not out of the ambit of devotional service. Because of one's past conditioning, one may have that ambition to do something big. So you dovetail that desire in doing something big for Krishna. Nothing wrong in that. But then, one has to go beyond even that. One has to, one has to go to a stage, where one will be simply interested in, serving Krishna's desires, whether as a success or a failure. So, such a devotee, when he becomes completely liberated, he will go to the supreme abode. He will go to the Goloka Vrindavan. So that is the point. So, desiring to serve Krishna in some big way, it is not that it is not devotional service. So that is also devotional service only, but it is not devotional service of the highest order. The main point is, when, when, higher than that is, to desire to serve Krishna according to his desire. That is more, that is even higher than desiring to serve Krishna in some big way. Is that okay?"

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/KTHudZWO2Ac?t=1941",
      "transcript": "Yes, please. Taking pleasure in the self, what it actually means. When we say taking pleasure only in the self, what it means is that, one, like Prabhupada is mentioning here, in the purport to that 17th verse, I will read that. Actually, those three things, that Prabhupada mentions, Krishna mentions, Atmarathi, Atmatruthah, and Atmanyeva Santoshra. These three are connected. So, Atmarathi means, a person, when a person engages in, when a, when a person, Atmarathi means one who takes pleasure only in the self. A person who is fully Krishna conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts in Krishna consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform. Due to his being Krishna conscious, all impiety within is instantly cleansed, and effect of many many thousands of Vijnaya performances. So actually Atmarathi means, a person who understands that, he is not the body, he is a spirit soul. So he is interested only in spiritual subject matter. He is not interested in satisfying his senses, right? So he is not interested in searching after the sense objects. He is more interested in understanding, he is more interested in understanding about himself, in spiritual subject matter. So such a person is said to be, taking pleasure only in the self. And, when one engages in, in devotional service to Krishna, with that understanding, that he wants to, with that, keeping away the desire for sense gratification, then what happens is, by such clearing of consciousness, one becomes fully confident of his eternal position, in relationship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated. So, Atma-tripta, Srila Prabhupada is translating, Atma-tripta as, one who is illumined in the self. So illumined in the self meaning, when one is engaged in understanding, when one is engaged in spiritual pursuit, and one engages in service to Krishna, one understands that, Oh! I am a servant of Krishna. This is my true position. So, such a position is called, self-illuminated, means he understands that he is a servant of Krishna, he is a part and parcel of Krishna, and he has to serve Krishna. And such a person, Atma-santushtaha, he is satisfied with the self only. Meaning, he is fully satiated, meaning he is satisfied, so by, first is he, he takes, he does activities only, related to spiritual subject matter. He is not interested in sense gratification. That is Atmarathi. And as an Atmarathi, when one understands that I am, I have to serve Krishna, I am a part and parcel of Krishna, then he becomes self-illuminated. Atma-tripta. And when in, when, when on that platform of understanding, I am part and parcel of Krishna, one is completely satisfied by serving Krishna. Oh! I am part and parcel of Krishna, I do service for Krishna, I am fully satisfied. He doesn't, he has come to a final conclusion. He is no more searching. There is no more search. What am I supposed to do? What are my duties? Nothing. This is the final thing. By serving Krishna, everything else is performed. So that is the level of satisfaction that a person feels. So then, that person is called an Atma-santushta. So that is a person who is satiated only in, only with the Self. So one is taking pleasure in the Self, one is illumined in the Self, and finally, one is satisfied with the Self. So this is, these are the three things. It's a progressive state."

Brajavas is, Brajavas is of course, they are, they are not only satisfied in serving Krishna, they are, they are serving Krishna out of full love. So they are beyond even this stage, right? You see, the difference between the Brajavasis and a normal devotee is, a liberated devotee is, a liberated devotee still has a sense of duty. He is performing his service to Krishna out of his sense of duty. I am a servant of Krishna, Krishna is the Supreme Lord, so I have to serve Him. That sense is there. Whereas in the Brajavasis, they are, they are not bothered whether Krishna is Supreme Person or not, they are not bothered. We just love Krishna, we want to serve Him. That's all. So they are even beyond that. So they are, the whole mood is simply out of love, they are serving Krishna. They are in Krishna Prema. That's the stage. We have to, we have to follow in their footsteps. That is the standard that Prabhupada has given us and that's what we have to. If we simply follow the instructions of Srila Prabhupada, if we study his books properly and understand Prabhupada's mood, just like I was explaining the poem that Prabhupada has written, so if you understand Prabhupada's mood and follow that, we will be, we will be following the footsteps of the Brajavasis. Because Prabhupada has given us the ultimate thing, nothing beyond this. There is nothing over and above what Prabhupada has given. Simply we follow Prabhupada's instructions, read his books nicely and, and understand that Prabhupada's mood, then we will, we will, actually Prabhupada is giving us residence in Goloka Vrindavan. Not even Vaikuntha Loka, not in any of the other spiritual planets. He is giving us opportunity to go back to the, to Goloka Vrindavan itself. That is the, that is what actually Prabhupada has given us. It is the ultimate that Prabhupada has given us. We can never, we can never appreciate enough the, the glory of what Prabhupada has given us."

      "transcript": "Yes please. Final question. Prabhu just wanted to know if, can one take for granted that whatever service comes from authority is perfect? You see, to be able to accept whatever service is assigned to one, as coming from Srila Prabhupada, requires a lot of surrender. If one is sufficiently advanced in Krishna Consciousness and one has surrendered sufficiently to the spiritual master, whatever service is allocated to one, that is actually it will be coming from Prabhupada. Because if you see, in that sense, what is this institution? This institution is set up by Srila Prabhupada. And Srila Prabhupada is giving instructions to all of us through a certain system that he has set up. There is a temple president, there is a temple commander, etc., etc. There is a hierarchy that is set up in the institution. And Prabhupada set this up to disseminate his instructions. So, if, actually, the, the, any flaw or any defect that we may see in the services or in the, in the, in the management of the temple actually is resulting from a flaw in ourselves. If we are flawed in our surrender, then to that extent, we will see flaws everywhere. We will see defects. If we are surrendered to the extent that we are able to appreciate whatever, this is a system that Prabhupada has set up, therefore whatever is coming in this, I accept as coming from Prabhupada. The service that is being allocated to me is coming to me from Prabhupada through this system, then actually what happens is it becomes direct service to the spiritual master. It is as good as Prabhupada directly calling you and telling, this is your service, please do it. So, the, it all depends on the extent of surrender that we, that we are having towards Srila Prabhupada. That is the whole point. So, it's as simple as that."
