As per the system given by Srila Prabhupada, as per his last wish, Diksha, how many are first initiation here? First initiation, right. So, Diksha, you may know already, comes from two words, sounds, Di and Ksha. Di represents Divya Gyan. And Ksha is Papakshaya. Two things which is primarily needed for returning home back to Krishna. All of you know that we are in a place which is unsuitable for us. Us meaning the spirit soul, not as the body, not as the mind, or not as the ego, what we have assumed. So, this is not the place for the living entities to be in, because he should be with Krishna. He should be associating with Krishna and his paraphernalia. But unfortunately, we are here in this material world. And the process of liberation has already started by us coming in touch with this Brahma Madhva Gaudiya Parampara."

      "transcript": "The most sacred, live, vibrant, practising Parampara in the Vaishnava system. So, having come here, this is an opportunity for us to revive the Krishna Consciousness, which is as a Swaroopa of the spirit soul. So, to go back to our original position, the two most important aspect is the Gyan, Divya Gyan. Knowledge about our original position. Gyan does not mean just material or theoretical understanding, superficial understanding. All of us know Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All of us have heard, we are not the body. All of us know we have to go back to him, but we are not able to go back to him. So, knowledge is there, but the Vijnana, the realised knowledge. Realising the knowledge by practice. Making the knowledge a reality. That is Divya Gyan. Realised knowledge. Ten Brahma Hridayat, like Brahma, realised. So, this realisation happens in the heart, not in the memory. So, this Divya Gyan is one of the components required to go back to the original position. But for that, the stopping, what is stopping us is the Karma, which is due to Papa. So, this building up of this Papa is there, which is stopping us from knowing the Jnana, which is stopping us from performing the original constitutional activities. Now, we are performing conditional activities. Those activities which we are made to do in this condition. Sometimes we are in human condition, we do human activities. We are in animal condition, you do animal activities. So, these are conditional activities. Even the activities we may do in Varna and Ashram are also conditional activities. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, Abramacharis, Sanyasis, these are all conditional. Constitutional activity, Nitya Seva. The constitutional activity is Krishna Consciousness. Krishna Consciousness, Bhakti, performance of devotional service to the Supreme Lord."

So, taking shelter of such a spiritual master, taking shelter of this Acharya, who is dear to Krishna, who has come to us by good fortune and by the mercy of this personality. So, that is the opportunity we have in this decision you all have made by taking this determination. So, Diksha is a beginning process. It is not an end process. By Diksha, one gets opportunity for this purification. Yes, there are certain qualifications, qualifications needed. Some qualification needed to get Diksha. Just like if you want to be a doctor, you should have a pre-university degree. With your SSLC or a matriculation, you cannot enter a MBBS college. So, there is a pre-requirement of getting something to get into this college. So, this is like an admission, which guarantees that you will become a doctor. But by admission, you don't become a doctor. Similarly, by Diksha, you don't become pure. It is a pre-requisite to become pure. And for Diksha, there are also pre-requirements. So, having qualified for Diksha, which is what? Qualification of Diksha is the determination. Determination to follow. Determination to serve. Determination to give up. Determination to surrender."

So, a devotee who is taking Diksha, who is desiring to go back to Godhead, who is desiring to serve the spiritual master, has to first understand that he is ready to give up his own requirements. Unless we are ready to give up our own requirements, we cannot surrender 100% to the spiritual master and 100% dedicate our life to satisfy his wishes. Why? Because the Supreme Lord has wished that anybody who comes back to him should come through his pure devotees. As Krishna has explained in Adi Purana, anybody who considers himself as my devotee, I don't consider him as a devotee, unless he considers himself as a devotee of my devotee. That is the process. That is the principle. So, to satisfy the devotee of the Supreme Lord, one surrenders to him. And it's a very personal philosophy. This is not a mechanical philosophy that okay, I studied five years in engineering college, I have to get a certificate if I pass. I have gone through five years of doctorate, I have to become doctorate. I have done my research, I have to get. But here I have done everything, read Bhagavatam ten thousand times, I may not get Krishna. That is the difference. Material knowledge and spiritual knowledge, because spiritual knowledge is under the control of a personality."

He may say yes sir, and behind him he will say so many other things. It doesn't matter. It's not a personal connection. Even though in many of the tradition knowledge, personal connection is important. You take any of those Vaidika knowledge, Natya Shastra, or any of those things also, the blessing of the teacher, blessing of the guru, this is a system in the Vedic system, not in the modern system. But spiritual system is totally different. In spiritual system, one cannot get Krishna without pleasing the servant of Krishna. Now pleasing the servant of Krishna does not mean simply shaking your head in front of him. Yes, yes, yes. It is not a tongue service. It is a service. It is surrender of one's heart. So one has to Manasa Vacha Karvana, by one's mind, by one's words, and by one's action, have to surrender to the personality and not only surrender up to the personality, make sure that the personality is satisfied. That is a requirement to get Krishna. So there is a system, but there is a very, very deep personal connection. That personal connection makes us qualified"

Even if you are a great intelligent person, you are a great orator, you are a great Vedic person, I am available only if I allow you to be. No? I allow myself to be available to you. So this is Krishna's demand. So he is called transcendental autocrat. And we are all against autocrats in this material world, right? Nobody likes autocrat. Everybody blames you, he is an autocrat. Krishna is an autocrat. Can you accept that? Yes. If we can accept Krishna is autocrat, and his wish goes, nothing but his wish, then we are ready. So this is a preparation to get that consciousness. Deeksha is a preparation to get that consciousness. Deeksha allows us to get that consciousness. Why? Because once we have the blessing of the spiritual master, then we are not fighting alone. The world is like a fight. Fighting against maya, fighting against the current. So if you are alone, it's difficult. We need to have equipments. We have to be properly armed when we are fighting, right? The same way, the arm, the armor, that's the blessing of the spiritual master."

I like you, I want to marry you. But I don't like your mother, I don't like your father, I don't like a dog, I don't like your house, I don't like. Impossible. he has to get out. But you cannot go to Krishna saying, Krishna, I like you but nothing around you. That is not possible. They're accepting the whole. We are not accepting one person because Krishna is that whole. You cannot say, I'll take Krishna but I don't like this, I don't like that. No. Block, stock and barrel you have to accept. So one has to understand that one is entering the whole. We are separated like the spark is separated from the fire. So today we are separated. Now we have to get into the whole which means Krishna and his paraphernalia. Krishna, his devotees, his places, his paraphernalia, his philosophy, his desires, his interest. We are part of him. Now we are disconnected so we think, I mean this is different Krishna's interest is different. So as part of surrender, one of the principal elements of surrender is to accept the interest of Krishna and keep our interest aside. There are six aspects of surrender. So keeping Krishna's interests. So this learning process starts with diksha. It's not an"

So Grihasthas they earn money, they spend their time in earning money and they earn money whether it's an employment, whether it's a business and they have the duty for their ashram, the Grihastha ashram duties which includes immediate requirement, which includes emergency requirement. And he parts proportionately to his surrender the balance to the spiritual master's cause. That is a surrender and he keeps aside time enough to serve the spiritual master. So giving one's time and giving one's energy is a symptom of surrender, not taking Diksha, change name or you have a white thread that doesn't make us qualified as a qualified surrendered soul. What makes us qualified surrendered soul is what quantum of time and energy we spend for the absolute cause. So that all that begins with Diksha. And a person taking Diksha is determined to do these things. If anybody wants to think twice, this is the right time.

Having come to know the dirty road, he gets into the proper path. So now we are driving on the main road. Till now we were driving on the drainage. Most intelligent person. Why? He doesn't work like a donkey in this material world for material causes. So one has to balance his life, his material requirements and keep spiritual requirement as a priority and step by step, if you follow this process, Gropa is already guaranteed as shelter of Krishna. Why all these things? To get the ultimate shelter which gives us Satchitananda, the state of eternity, the state of shelter and permanent bliss, not material bliss, not temporary bliss. Permanent happiness. So if you want to experience the happiness of the soul, Atma Ramaha, self-sufficiently blissful soul, satisfied in himself, in service of the Supreme Lord. So that is the position we are trying to get. That is why it is called intelligent. Rather than in this material world, somehow or the other trying to get happy, despite of all the difficulties, crossed difficulties, and after all these things, the man thinks, he's a hero. I've made it in this material world. That is where Gropa says, this is like a camel chewing the thorn. Finally, he's only testing his blood. Same way the man who says he's successful in the material world is only testing his own blood without knowing. That is not intelligent. What is intelligent is understanding that I am in an unnecessary business and enter the real business, which gives real bliss, real happiness, real connection with our relations. All the relations in this material world, by the way, happen so. But the real relationship is with Krishna and the pure devotees. And that begins with diksha.
