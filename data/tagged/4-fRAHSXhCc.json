Raghavera Jali After accepting his sannyas, Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu moved to reside at Jagannath Puri. Every year during the Rathayatra festival, almost all the devotees from Bengal would travel to Puri to unite with Lord Gaurasundara once again. Sri Mati Damayanti Devi would cook innumerable items for Mahaprabhu with her love and affection and devotion and thereafter pack these in separate bags. Raghava Pandita would then carry these bags to Puri during his annual visit and offer them to Lord Chaitanya. These bags of delicious food items came to be subsequently known as Raghavera Jali, the bags of Raghavendra Pandita."

Nithyananda Prabhu has manifested many awe-inspiring pastimes here. It was here at Panihatti on the bank of Ganges that Raghunath Das Goswami, the son of the earth's white wealthy landlord of Saptagram, Sri Govardhan Majumdar, had received the costless mercy of Sri Nithyananda Prabhu. It was Nithyananda Prabhu's mercy that enabled Sri Raghunatha to later obtain the shelter and service at the feet of Lord Chaitanya. Raghunatha went on to become one of the six Goswamis of Vrindavana and is renowned all over the three worlds for his renunciation and love for the Supreme. So that is Panihatti. So we know about the Panihatti festival. Nithyananda Prabhu was there and Raghunatha Goswami, Raghunatha was ordered to feed all the brahmanas, all the devotees and every year at Panihatti this festival is commemorated."
