      "transcript": "of the 15th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The meaning of this verse is, During our exile, Durvasa Muni, who eats with his 10,000 disciples, intrigued with our enemies to put us in dangerous trouble. At that time, Lord Krishna, simply by accepting the remnants of food, saved us. By his accepting food thus, the assembly of Munis, while bathing in the river, felt sumptuously fed, and all the three worlds were also satisfied. This is a wonderful pastime of Krishna, described in detail in the Mahabharata, but just mentioned here by Arjuna. Arjuna is recollecting these wonderful incidents, all by Krishna's grace, how the Pandavas were saved, so many different instances are recollected by Arjuna."

      "transcript": "So it is described, Durvasa Muni, he was a very powerful mystic Brahmana, and he had performed a lot of austerities. So he had a lot of power, mystic power. And this Durvasa Muni, he was a partial incarnation of Lord Shiva. And when he was satisfied with somebody's service, he would do a lot of good to that person. But if he was dissatisfied, he could bring about the greatest calamity. Once it so happened that he was, this Durvasa Muni was, a guest at the house of Kunti's father. And Kunti was serving him as a young girl, and Durvasa Muni was satisfied with her, and he blessed her with the power to call any devata she desired in order to have a child. Now, Durvasa Muni could foresee that this Kunti, when she grows up, she will not be able to beget children through her husband Pandu. Therefore, Durvasa Muni blessed her in this way. And it turned out that Kunti could beget children only by calling upon some demigods, because she could not beget children through Pandu. So, this Durvasa Muni used to travel in space by his great mystic powers, and he could travel everywhere in the whole universe. Now, once he was a guest at the palace of Duryodhana in Hastinapura. And Duryodhana satisfied this brahmana, Durvasa Muni, and when Durvasa Muni was satisfied, Durvasa Muni wanted to give some benediction to Duryodhana. So, Duryodhana knew that this Durvasa Muni has got a lot of mystic powers. So, what did Duryodhana ask this Durvasa Muni? He requested that Durvasa Muni become a guest of Yudhishthira Maharaj, who is in exile, who was in exile at that time, that you become a guest of Yudhishthira, and you should visit him only after Draupadi has finished her meals. At such a time, on such a day, you should visit the King Yudhishthira in exile."

      "transcript": "So, Durvasa Muni agreed because he was very pleased with Duryodhana. Now, Duryodhana's plan was that when Durvasa Muni visits Yudhishthira with 10,000 disciples, and that too after Draupadi has finished her meal, then how will Yudhishthira feed Durvasa Muni and his 10,000 disciples? Because the Pandavas during exile, they had been gifted with one special pot. That pot would give enough food to any number of people, till Draupadi would take her meals. After that, the pot would not give any more food, not produce any more food. So, when Durvasa Muni visited the camp of Yudhishthira in the forest as his guest, he visited after Draupadi had finished her meals. So, Yudhishthira received this Durvasa Muni very nicely and requested the Muni to go to the nearby river and take bath and finish his noon duties and then come for lunch. So, the Muni went, Durvasa Muni went with his 10,000 disciples to the river to take bath. All of them were taking bath and in the meantime, Yudhishthira became very anxious. How is he going to serve lunch for Durvasa Muni and his 10,000 disciples? So, in his anxiety, he was praying to Krishna because they are all devotees of Krishna. So, Yudhishthira realized that Durvasa Muni has come after Draupadi has finished her meals. So, how will they feed? In any case, Yudhishthira requested Draupadi to do something. Then Draupadi began to pray to Krishna. And Draupadi, when she prayed to Krishna, Krishna appeared in front of Draupadi. The Lord is very merciful to his devotees, especially to his devotees. So, because Draupadi was in trouble, she was praying to the Lord and Lord Krishna appeared. Then, when Draupadi told Krishna about their dangerous situation, Krishna just requested Draupadi that you give me some food, then your problem is solved. So, Draupadi, when she heard that Krishna is asking for some food, she felt very bad that she could not serve Krishna with any food because she had finished her meals and there was nothing else in stock."

      "transcript": "So, when she was unable to give any food to Krishna, she began to cry, as is natural for a woman who is in difficulty. But, when she began to cry, Krishna called her and said, Why don't you bring that pot which has been gifted by the Sun God to you? Bring that pot now, immediately. So, Draupadi brought that pot. The pot was empty. The pot was not having any food. So then, Krishna examined very carefully inside the pot. There was one small grain of foodstuff sticking to a corner of the pot. So, Krishna picked up that small grain and ate it immediately. After Krishna had taken that one small grain remaining in the pot, he told Draupadi, Now, you can invite your guests and you can feed them. So, on Krishna's instruction, Draupadi went to Yudhishthira and told him, Now, the guests can be invited. So, Yudhishthira sent Bhima to the river to call Durvasamuni and his 10,000 disciples to come for lunch. And meantime, what had happened, that Durvasamuni and his disciples were taking bath in the river and performing their religious duties. They began to feel completely satisfied, completely satisfied. Their hunger was completely mitigated. That, when Bhima came to invite them, Durvasamuni thought, Oh, Yudhishthira should have arranged a big feast and I am feeling very much full. How can I do justice? I better don't go. I don't accept that invitation because I am already feeling completely full in my stomach, in my belly, just by taking this bath. Though actually, Durvasamuni had not taken his meals at all that day, but still he began to feel full. So, since Durvasamuni thought that he didn't want to disappoint Yudhishthira by refusing outright the lunch, so he quietly went away from that place without going to Yudhishthira's camp. He and his disciples all felt completely full and they went away. Now, how is it that without eating anything, actually the 10,000 disciples of Durvasamuni and Durvasamuni himself began to feel full? It is because yasmintushte jagatushtihi When Krishna is satisfied, everyone is satisfied. When Krishna's hunger is mitigated, everyone's hunger is mitigated."

      "transcript": "Because Krishna is the center and everyone else is his part, his amsa. He is a complete whole. So, this incident proves that a householder must always offer food to the Lord and in that way a householder will be able to satisfy or please anybody, any number of guests, including guests numbering 10,000 which Durvasamuni used to travel with. So, Yudhishthira Maharaj was able to actually satisfy Durvasamuni with all his 10,000 disciples simply by Krishna accepting a tiny grain of particle. In fact, Krishna is not in need of anything, but he accepts when something is offered with devotion for the sake of benedicting his devotees, for the sake of reciprocating with his devotees. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much."
