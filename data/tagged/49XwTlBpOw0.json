      "transcript": "When Manu Samhita, Manu is saying that women have to be always protected, they should not be given independence, meaning they should not be let free. They should not be let free without protection at any point of time. Women are always to be accorded special protection. Not only that, we combine it with the statement which is given by Chanakya Pandit, who says that a learned person should always look upon every woman other than his wife as his mother. Now, from childhood, if a man is educated that woman is not an object of enjoyment, she is to be respected like mother, and she is worthy always of your protection, not your exploitation."

      "transcript": "Then what happens? Every man will have great respect towards every woman who is not, even though the woman may not be related to him. And that is how in the olden times, women were given so much respect that if a man were to abduct a woman, then according to the Shastras, the husband of that woman can go and kill that abductor, and there is no sin involved in this. And the most brilliant example of this is how Lord Ramachandra, he killed Ravana. Not only Ravana, Ravana's entire dynasty. Whoever stood in support of Ravana, all of them were killed by Ramachandra. For what? Just because of his one wife, Sita, who had been abducted by Ravana. Lord Ramachandra set the example."

      "transcript": "From this, what we can understand is the honor of a woman was accorded the highest position in the society, according to Manusamhita. Woman was to be highly respected. Children had to be respected. Women had to always take her wish as their command. This was the actual spirit of Manu's instructions in the Manusamhita. It was not for any sort of suppression or oppression or exploitation of any kind. Women were given so much respect, and whenever women would be disrespected, then it would result in some war or the other. Even Mahabharata, the war of Mahabharata and the war of Ramayana, both of the wars, if you see, were fought because the honor of a woman was insulted."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/49XwTlBpOw0?t=150",
      "transcript": "The Pandavas and the Kauravas were living together. Little bit skirmishes here and there used to happen. Little bit fight here and there used to happen, but it never used to be a full-fledged fight to death. But the day the Kauravas decided to insult Draupadi by trying to disrobe her, that day the seeds of their death in the battle were sown. That was the instance where the Pandavas decided that the Kauravas have to die because of the insult they have committed to Draupadi. Similarly, the day Ramana kidnapped Sita, that day his death was written. We can understand both the battles, both the great battles in our history have happened to protect the honor of a woman. That means the Manusamhita and the people in those days used to live by the Manusamhita, by the codes of the Manusamhita. That was the Dharma. Path of Dharma means we have to follow the Manusamhita. So people understood the spirit of Manu's instructions, and accordingly, the woman was given such high respect."
