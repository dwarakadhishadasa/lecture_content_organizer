The meaning of this verse is: At Maharaj Yudhishthira's inquiry, Bhishma Deva first defined all the classifications of caste and orders of life in terms of the individual's qualifications. Then he systematically, in two-fold divisions, described counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment. So the description continues by Suta Goswami to the sages of Naimisharanya that this conversation between Yudhishthira making inquiry about caste and orders of life, about dharma, and Bhishma replying is given in great details in the Mahabharata, but the summary is given here."

      "transcript": "So Bhishma first of all explained Varna Dharma. A civilized society is divided into four Varanas based on occupational duties, occupational engagements, according to their acquired nature. So those in Sattva Guna, their acquired nature is suitable for doing Brahmanical duties: Brahmanas. Kshatriyas, their acquired nature is Rajoguna. So they are suited for doing occupation of a Kshatriya: administrative duties, protection against harm of the innocent people, saintly persons, weaker sections of society. And the Vaishyas, their acquired nature is a mixed mode of passion and ignorance. So they are suited for doing Vaishya duties. They are the economic generators of the society. And the Shudras are mostly in the mode of ignorance, and they are mentioned in the Mahabharata. They are meant for doing some labor. They are meant to engage in the service of the upper three divisions: Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. Everything goes by quality, not by birth, not by some hereditary title. No. It goes by qualification. So in terms of the individual's qualifications, he described Varana Dharma. What is Brahmana Dharma? What is Kshatriya Dharma? What is Vaishya Dharma? What is Shudra Dharma?"

So Brahmachari Dharma, Grahastha Dharma, Vanaprastha Dharma, Sanyas Dharma, everything Bheeshma Deva described systematically. Then he also described counteraction by detachment and interaction by attachment. So Srila Prabhupada explains these things in the purport. Prabhupada has written elaborate purport. I don't have time to go through the whole purport. I will try to cover some important points that the conception of the four Varanas and four Ashramas as planned by the Lord Himself, as described in the Bhagavad Gita: Chatur Varnyam Mayasrishtam Gunakarma Vibhagshah, is to accelerate transcendental qualities of the individual person so that he may gradually realize his spiritual identity and thus act accordingly to get free from material bondage with your conditional life. See, the goal is that everybody should be freed from bondage, not just the brahmanas, not just some few educated or learned people. No. Everyone should get free from bondage, and that's possible by following the Dharma. Anyone and everyone can actually become liberated."

      "transcript": "That is the whole idea. In the Mahabharata, it is most elaborately explained by Bhishma Deva in the Shanti Parva beginning from the 60th chapter. Prabhupada has given reference. Where do you get details? Here it is briefly explained. It is just mentioned. It is not even explained. But Prabhupada gives a little explanation here. Now the Varnashrama Dharma is most often misunderstood, especially in the modern times, that this caste system has created artificial domination of Brahmanas or Brahmanas and Kshatriyas over the other sections of society. No. That is not Varnashrama Dharma. That is a misinterpretation. That is the degradation of the Varnashrama Dharma. When unqualified people claim to be Brahmanas or Kshatriyas, they tend to exploit the weaker sections of society. That is not Varnashrama Dharma. So Varnashrama Dharma is prescribed for the civilized human being just to train him to successfully terminate human life. What is successful termination of human life? Self-realization to attain self-realization and thereby become free from material bondage."

So Bhishma Deva advised for all human beings, not just for Brahmanas or not just for some people. No, 9 qualifications. What are they? Not to become angry, not to lie, not to equally distribute wealth, to forgive, to beget children only by one's legitimate wife, to be pure in mind and hygienic in body, not to be inimical toward anyone, to be simple. And the ninth one is to support servants or subordinates. It is explained here by Srila Prabhupada based on the description given by Bhishma Deva in the Mahabharata. One cannot be called a civilized person without acquiring the above mentioned preliminary qualities. Then there are specific qualities by which Brahmanas work, the Kshatriyas work, the Vaishyas work, and the Shudras work. Everybody has got specific occupational duties mentioned in the Vedas."

      "transcript": "Now briefly Prabhupada says for the intelligent men, that is the Brahmanas, controlling the senses is the most essential qualification. Now it is the basis of morality. Why control the senses? It is the basis of morality. So if an intelligent man abuses his position, if he does not follow the Vedic way of life, he should seriously study Vedic literatures, especially Bhagavatam and Bhagavad Gita, and it is imperative that such a person willing to study should approach a bona fide spiritual master. He should not do anything which is forbidden in the Shastra. For the Kshatriya, it is especially advised to give charity and never accept charity in any circumstances. Kshatriya especially should give charity. So the Kshatriyas were meant to support the Brahmanas by giving them profuse charity, and thereby the Brahmanas could give free service to everyone in the society in matter of guiding them, giving them direction, enlightening them, and helping them whenever they were in difficulty. So this is the perfect society as described"

Now one of the important duties of the Kshatriya is to actually protect the weaker sections of the society, the rest of the society, by not pretending to become non-violent when there is a need to chastise the miscreants, the rogues, the thieves, the plunderers. They should be severely chastised by using violence by the Kshatriyas. Then the Vaishyas, they should particularly protect cows and grow sufficient grains and agriculture and distribution of foodstuff, especially meant for the Vaishyas, and Kshatriyas were given charge of protection of the citizens. Vaishyas were given charge of protection of the cows, Goraksh, and they used to produce profusely agricultural produce and milk and milk products. And then the Shudras, they have no independence because they are not sufficiently intelligent enough to use their independence, so they are meant to render sincere service to the upper three sections so that they can get all their comforts of life simply by rendering service to the higher classes because as soon as a Shudra accumulates wealth, he should never be given money because as soon as he accumulates wealth, it will be misused for sinful activities in wine, women, and gambling."

The Shudras should always be provided with all the necessities without giving them money so that they are satisfied in all respects and they don't have accumulated wealth to misuse them. And the upper three sections, they should maintain the Shudras under all circumstances. Never should the Shudras be abandoned by any of the upper sections."

And the household life is for one who is attached, and Vanaprastha and Sanya's orders of life are meant for those who are detached. Hmm, householders are generally attached to family and so many family paraphernalia, but the Brahmachari Ashram is especially meant for training both the attached and the detached so that the goal is self-realization. Either somebody is attached or somebody is detached, but the goal is self-realization. That should not be forgotten. So I will stop here. Thank you very much."
