And here we see Srinivas Acharya and his line. Ramachandra Kaviraj, this is the same person we were talking about this morning, the Potwala and the Panwala, the great friends of Narottam Das Thapur. So, we have the deities of Gauranga Mahaprabhu, two Gauranga Mahaprabhus. One is Gaur Gopal and the other one is Gaur Govinda. So, these are the two deities worshipped by these two brothers. You also have small Gopal deities gifted by Janava Devi. So, these three personalities did take lot of guidance and association from Janava Devi after the departure of Nithyananda Prabhu. So, these are all Nithyananda Vamsas, our direct connection: Nithyananda Prabhu, Janava Devi, and then Srinivas Acharya, Shamananda Pandit, and Narottam Das Thapur, all taking initiation and finishing their studies from Vrindavan from the six Goswamis."
