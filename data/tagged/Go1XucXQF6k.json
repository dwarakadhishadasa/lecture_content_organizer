The meaning of this verse is: King Yudhishthira, who was very satisfied with the birth of Maharaj Pariksit, had the purificatory process of birth performed. Learned Brahmanas, headed by Dhaumya and Kripa, recited auspicious hymns."

But if one becomes purified of all material contaminations, one revives his or her spiritual position. The spiritual process is the purification of the material contaminations. So this is a great science, it is called the Spiritual Science."

So for such purification to happen, they take help of learned brahmanas who know the science, and they actually perform the purification by the proper method according to the science. So Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, there is a need for a good and intelligent class of brahmanas who are expert in performing the purificatory processes prescribed in the system of varnashrama dharma. Varnashrama dharma is a scientific method of purification, a system of practicing Dharma, religion, religious processes by which every human being can become purified of all material contamination and revive their spiritual position. Unless such purificatory processes are performed, there is no possibility of good population. How can we have a nice population, nice citizens, responsible, well-behaved, with good qualities, who know the aim of life, who are progressive in their thinking? How can we get such a population by performing such purificatory processes under the able guidance of the with the help of learned Brahmanas."

Now, shudra quality means they are not refined, they are not purified, why? Because there is no purificatory process for purifying the child which is born, why? Because there is this acute scarcity of learned brahmanas. So such learned brahmanas are not easily available in Kali Yuga. Some so called brahmanas by birth are there in Kali Yuga, but they are all bogus."

He is not a blind follower, he is not a foolish person who actually is ignorant but poses as a Brahmana by cheating innocent people. Not such a Brahmana. So there is an acute scarcity of qualified, learned, gentle Brahmanas. Such Brahmanas are not there in Kali Yuga. It is not possible, however, to revive the Vedic process of purification in this age of Kali, but there is the Pancharatrika system also recommended for this age. See, this Varnashram. To revive that is very difficult in Kali Yuga because there are no proper facilities and there are no good Brahmanas to revive this."

The Pancharatrika system acts on the Shudra class of men, supposedly the population of Kali Yuga. So Pancharatrika is specially meant for the Shudra class of people, those who are born without cultural purification, without samskara. Such people, they can take advantage of the Pancharatrika system. And in this Pancharatrika system, there is a prescribed purificatory process suitable for this age and the present time. You see, this is the arrangement of the Supreme Lord Krishna for us in Kali Yuga when there is a scarcity of Brahmanas, when there is no cultural purification happening before the birth of a child. Such a purification or purificatory process as prescribed in the Pancharatrika system is allowed only for spiritual purification, for spiritual upliftment and not for any other purpose. See, the purpose is also very clearly explained in the scriptures. Why this Pancharatrika system is given when already the scriptures describe a Varanashrama Dharma system? Why? Because it is necessary for spiritual upliftment of the population through this Pancharatrika method."

After the Garbhadana purificatory process, there are certain other samskaras like Seeman Tonnayana, Sardh Bhakshana, etc. During the period of pregnancy and when the child is born, the first purificatory process is Jatakarma. See, before a child is conceived, the very first samskara is called Garbhadana samskara. Or, the parents combine to conceive a child by themselves purifying their consciousness of material contamination by observing their child, by observing certain specific practices. Now, that is missing in Kali Yuga. Garbhadana samskara is missing. They do not even know about it, that they can have a child with a good background if they are able to perform this Garbhadana samskara. They themselves become purified before they combine for conceiving a child. It's not accidental. It's not by chance some child is born to some parents. No. It is a complete science. What kind of child you want, accordingly there is a prescription in the scriptures."

And it is described here that these two Brahmanas, Dhaumya and Kripacharya, were very learned, and they properly performed that samskara because of which the child was properly purified. Cultural purification of the child happened because of these two expert Brahmanas performing the Jatakarma samskara. I'll stop here. Thank you very much."
