      "transcript": "In this session, we continue discussing the same verse, the 10th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, the famous Atmarama verse. Suta Vacha Atmaramas Chamunayo Nirgrantha Apyurukrame Kurvanti Ahitu Keem Bhaktim Ittham Bhuta Gunoharihi All different varieties of Atmaramas, especially those established on the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, render unalloyed devotional service to the personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls. So Krishna attracts everyone because he has got unlimited transcendental qualities. Continuing the discussion from the previous session, in the previous session we heard how Krishna actually purifies anybody who takes to devotional service. So they become free from all sinful reactions, and all their impediments are removed and they are enlightened, and they become attracted to the transcendental form of Krishna, transcendental features of Krishna, transcendental qualities of Krishna, and they become pure devotees, completely dedicated, and they become a creator for Krishna's service."

      "summary": "The lecture explains the three processes of realizing the Absolute Truth: philosophical speculation (Brahman), mystic yoga (Paramatma), and devotional service (Bhagavan), emphasizing that devotional service leads to the highest realization.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/bLRRbgVTBSg?t=149",
      "transcript": "Now, Krishna is realized through three processes, the Absolute Truth. Krishna means the Absolute Truth is realized through three processes: the process of philosophical speculation, the process of performing Ashtanga, you call it a mystic yoga process, and the process of devotional service. So Lord Chaitanya has learned this. So Lord Chaitanya is now explaining, although the words Brahma and Aatma indicate Krishna, their direct meanings refer only to the impersonal Brahma and the super soul respectively. Brahma means impersonal Brahman. Atma means the super-soul in the heart of every living being. So why the distinction is being made now is, because if one follows the path of philosophical speculation, Gyanamarga, the Absolute Truth manifests Himself as impersonal Brahman. That means through the Jnana Marga one cannot realize Krishna simply by following the Jnana Marga. The topmost possible realization of the Absolute Truth through Jnana Marga is only the impersonal Brahman. If one follows the path of Mystic Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga system, he manifests himself as a Supersoul. So through Ashtanga Yoga only the Paramatma can be realized, only the Paramatma. But through devotional service one realizes Krishna, the personality of Godhead Bhagavan. In the Bhagavatam it is explained there are three features: the Absolute Truth, the impersonal Brahman, the localized Paramatma or the Supersoul, and ultimately the personality of Godhead Bhagavan. So among these three features, realization of Bhagavan, the personality of Godhead is the highest realization and that includes the other two realizations of Brahman and Paramatma."

      "summary": "The speaker differentiates between spontaneous and regulative devotional service, highlighting that spontaneous devotion in Vrindavan leads to Krishna, while regulative practice leads to expansions of the Supreme Lord.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/bLRRbgVTBSg?t=288",
      "transcript": "So now Lord Chaitanya explains there are two kinds of devotional activity: spontaneous and regulative. By spontaneous devotional service one attains the original personality of Godhead Krishna and by the regulative process one attains the expansion of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Krishna is present as Krishna and Krishna is also present in his various forms as Narayana, Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Narasimha, Vamana etc. etc. So many other forms. All are Krishna only, the same Supreme person. But there are still some differences. So Lord Chaitanya says by executing spontaneous devotional service in Vrindavan one attains the original Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna. The nature of devotional service in Vrindavan is that it is spontaneous. Spontaneous means they don't have to follow the rules and regulations. They have somehow attraction for Krishna to a degree that they only think of Krishna all the time. Their heart is completely filled with thoughts of Krishna. Their mind is absorbed in Krishna. They have become mad after Krishna, almost like mad people. They are not mad. They are very intelligent. They are very conscientious. But they are so much absorbed in thought of Krishna. So that is spontaneous devotional service in Vrindavan."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/bLRRbgVTBSg?t=395",
      "transcript": "And Lord Chaitanya quotes a verse from the Bhagavatam. This verse is spoken by Shukadeva Goswami. Shukadeva Goswami tells Pariksit Maharaj after describing one past time of Krishna being bound to Krishna, Krishna being bound by the rope of Mother Yashoda. Krishna submits himself to his devotee Mother Yashoda. So Shukadeva Goswami says the Supreme personality of Godhead Krishna the son of Mother Yashoda is accessible to those devotees engaged in spontaneous loving service, but he is not as easily accessible to mental speculators, to those striving for self-realization by severe austerities, or to those who consider the body the same as the self. So other processes other than spontaneous devotional service cannot help one realize Krishna the Supreme personality of Godhead."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/bLRRbgVTBSg?t=463",
      "transcript": "Now what about regulative devotional service? Regulative devotional service is following the rules and regulations of Bhakti very strictly. By executing regulative devotional service one becomes an associate of Narayana and attains the Vaikunthalokas, the spiritual planets and the spiritual sky. There are two kinds of spiritual planets: One is Goloka Vrindavana, Krishna's personal abode, and the other set of spiritual planets, are the Vaikunthalokas, where the Supreme Lord as Narayana is the predominator, is the Lord of Vaikuntha, Vaikunthapati. Now the explanation further about spontaneous devotional service. Those who discuss the activities of Lord Krishna are on the highest platform of devotional life, and they evince the symptoms of tears in the eyes and bodily jubilation. Very naturally they experience bhava, spiritual emotions. Such persons discharge devotional service to Krishna without practicing the rules and regulations of the mystic yoga system. You see, they possess all spiritual qualities. This is spoken by Brahma, and they are elevated to the spiritual world beyond the material world."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/bLRRbgVTBSg?t=566",
      "transcript": "Now, among devotees, Chaitanya explains, Lord Chaitanya explains, the devotees are divided into three categories: Akama, those who are desireless, means they don't have any material desires. Then there are some who are moksha kama, those who desire liberation, and sarva kama, those who have desire, material perfection. So it is said in the Bhagavatam, one who is actually intelligent, although he may be a devotee free from material desires, a karmi desiring all kinds of material facilities, or a jnani desiring liberation, should seriously engage in bhakti yoga for the satisfaction of supreme peace. That is what the Indian personality has called it. So the meaning of the word udaradhi is buddhiman, intelligent or considerate. Because of this, even for one's own sense gratification, one engages in the devotional service of Lord Krishna. Actually, devotional service is meant for giving us bhakti. Let us say somebody takes to devotional service but their goal is not bhakti. Their goal is some material gain or their goal is liberation. Then what happens? Something very, very interesting happens. The other processes of self-realization cannot yield results unless they are associated with devotional service. Devotional service, however, is so strong and independent that it can give one"

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/bLRRbgVTBSg?t=674",
      "transcript": "all the desired results. So this is substantiated in the Bhagavad Gita where Krishna says, O best among the Bharatas, Arjuna, four kinds of pious people render devotional service unto me, the distressed, the desirer of wealth, and he who is searching for the knowledge of the Absolute. Now, there is an example of somebody who desires money or wealth and takes to devotional service. Dhruva Maharaj is an example. What happened? He desired to have a kingdom greater than his father's and he was directed by his mother, you worship Vishnu. So he began to worship Vishnu. When merciful Lord Krishna understands that a foolish devotee desires material prosperity, he gratefully gives him shelter of his lotus feet. In this way, he can fend off all his ambitions. That's what happened to Dhruva Maharaj. It is said that Dhruva Maharaj has become a Bhikkhus and has begun to worship Supreme Lord Krishna. That's what happened to Dhruva Maharaj. He began to worship Supreme Lord Vishnu and Vishnu gave him darshan. Now when Vishnu gave darshan, Dhruva thought, I am doing all these austerities to ask from the Lord for what, a kingdom in this material world, that he compared to a piece of broken glass. He is looking for a piece of broken glass, foolishly, by doing devotional service, worshipping Vishnu. But when Vishnu appeared and gave him darshan, then he thought after seeing Vishnu, when I have got diamonds, why will I be interested in a piece of broken glass? So, Dhruva Maharaj told Vishnu, when Vishnu said, yes, what is the boon you want from me? So, Dhruva Maharaj said, when I obtained you, my dear Lord, I am not interested in asking any other benediction from you, I don't want any other benediction. It is like a person who has got diamonds. Why will he be interested? So, Krishna is so kind that when a devotee foolishly desires some material gain, Krishna gives himself to the devotee and he attracts the devotee so very much. The devotee completely forgets or considers the divine insignificant any other material gain that he might have been interested in before he began Bhakti. So this is Krishna's way of attracting a devotee who may not know the real goal of Bhakti but still nevertheless renders devotional service to Krishna even with a desire for some material gain."
