      "transcript": "to sleep, the manifestation of Krishna. So if somebody wants to serve God, then one need not think in his mind, \"Where is God to receive my service? How do I know He is receiving my service?\" All that to learn from guru, sadhu, shastra, that Krishna receives our service immediately. How much relationship we want with God, God is ready to give Himself to us. Krishna's only business is to be with His devotees, to be aware of His devotees, to show mercy to His devotees, show love to His devotees. And therefore, devotees' only business is always to think of Krishna, always serve Him. Krishna being absolute, there is no limitation for Him, and He decides, \"I am the deity,\" is deity, and He decides, \"I am the sound that you chant.\" It's Him. And Krishna is He is surya of satchidananda. Krishna means Krishna, the Supreme Personality with the supreme energies. Both Krishna and His energies incarnate in Kali Yuga, kalikale nama rupe krishnavatara. They descend in the most accessible manner. Simply you have to move your tongue and God is right there. How to recognize Him? How to feel Him? He is there. That is something that you will achieve by doing that, by hearing from guru, sadhu, shastra, hearing from Prabhupada, that Krishna, what is His omnipotency? Why He will be convinced? Yes, because we are all dear to Krishna, one Krishna, one Supreme Personality of Godhead. We are all His amshas, we all His namsa. So therefore, this chanting is not ordinary activity, this chanting of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra and hearing the Hare Krishna maha-mantra."

      "transcript": "devotee, he is chanting mechanically, he is not hearing, thinking of so many other things while the tongue is chanting, still the Lord is there, but He is saying, \"Oh, how foolish my devotee is, I am before him, I am available as a sound for him to embrace with his attention, but his attention is going somewhere else. If he embraces me, then there can be flow of sat, chitta, ananda, shakti, into him, to awaken him, his consciousness.\" Because Krishna is the Surya of sat, chitta, ananda. Just like Prabhupada says, \"A piece of iron put in the fire, slowly it becomes hot, hotter, hotter, red hot. Red hot means fire like fire. Red hot means fire like fire. Red hot means fire like fire.\" In the same way, Krishna is thinking, he is chanting, \"I am there, the fire of sat, chitta, ananda,\" but he is not coming into the fire of sat, chitta, ananda. Only when you give attention, then you are in the fire. So Krishna is very pleased if we chant and hear. Pleased for us,"

So therefore, Krishna is pleased with each bead of japa. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. So therefore, you have to chant here with Shraddha. Shraddha means Krishna is this sound. Omnipotent. If we touch this sound, how can sound be touched by hearing? Krishna is physically before you. You can embrace Him body to body with your arms around Him. Now also you can embrace Him, but you have to embrace Him on the same time, him with your attention. Just like a piece of iron put in the fire, the fire embraces the the iron embraces the fire. Similarly, when we do japa,"
