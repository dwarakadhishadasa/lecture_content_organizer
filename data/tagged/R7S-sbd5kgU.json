      "transcript": "Why did Dronacharya ask Ekalavya to give his thumb as Guru Dakshina? Is it to show the importance of surrendering to Guru or is it because Ekalavya was violating social order? Actually, Ekalavya was not a proper qualified person to have that skill of shooting arrows. If a wrong person has got some skill, he can misuse it. It is just like it is said in the scriptures itself. Shudras are not taught the Vedas. Why? That's because the Shudras don't have the intelligence to properly utilize the Vedic knowledge and use it for everyone's welfare, good. They may misuse it for some bad purposes or wrong purposes. It is just like somebody is a terrorist, he should not have weapons because he will misuse it like that. So, Ekalavya was not actually qualified to have the skill of shooting arrows. So, by asking him to give his thumb as Guru Dakshina, Dronacharya actually cut down his ability to use that skill, because the thumb is very important in actually shooting using a bow and arrow. So, that way he curtailed his usage for the social good, for the good of everyone else."

      "transcript": "It is said that by passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara, one can attain Vaikuntha, where can we find the source of the statement? This is said in one of the Puranas. Now, the significance of Vaikuntha Ekadashi, the day on which this festival is celebrated, especially in Vishnu temples, that one can pass through Vaikuntha Dwaara, that is to remind us that our destination should be Vaikuntha after quitting this body. And to make our destination as Vaikuntha is the correct goal of life. Otherwise, people either they do not have a goal of life in the sense that when we quit this body, which we are forced to do at the time of death, then where do I go? That people do not even know that they are spirit, soul and they are eternal. That itself they do not know. So, this is a particular important point that you understand. Attaining Vaikuntha means you understand I am spirit, soul. I don't die at the time of death. I change body. So, if I prepare myself, I can get a spiritual body and in that spiritual body I can attain Vaikuntha Loka. For eternal life full of bliss and knowledge that is awaiting us. If we want to go there, if we understand the importance of practicing Bhakti in order to go there,"

      "transcript": "So, merely doing a ritual of passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara is not enough. Passing through Vaikuntha Dwaara is to remind ourselves that we should prepare our consciousness by purifying it of all material contamination. So, the Supreme Lord is very eager to take us back to his personal abode called Vaikuntha. And he wants us to qualify. Qualify in what sense? Due to long association with this material nature, our consciousness has become polluted by material desires, by material reactions, by material contamination. So, to purify this is essential. As long as we have material contamination or material desires, we have to keep taking birth in this material world. Because those desires can be fulfilled only in this material world. Material contamination is not permitted in the spiritual world. Spiritual world, everything is spiritual. The Supreme Lord is completely spiritual. His abode is completely spiritual. The devotees are completely spiritually situated. So, everything is spiritual there. Nothing is material. So, therefore, we have to prepare ourselves. And anyway, that is our original position. As spirit soul, we belong to the spiritual world. We have a relationship with the Supreme Lord in his personal abode. And he is our maintainer. He is our protector. He is our well-wisher. He is our everything in the spiritual world. But then if we remain with this material desires or material comforts or material aspirations, then we cannot leave this world and go away."

      "transcript": "So, please remember, this going through Vaikuntha Dwara is to remind us that prepare yourself before death comes. Become Krishna conscious. And be ready to go to the abode of the Supreme Lord Vaikuntha. Next question. In the introduction to Bhagavad Gita As It Is, Srila Prabhupada says, if one remembers the form of Krishna at a time of death, he can approach the spiritual kingdom. What is this form and how to remember? Okay. The form of Krishna, Krishna is present in several different forms. The easiest way to understand form of Krishna is the form of the deity of Krishna, Krishna Vikraha, Archa Vikraha. You go to any temple of Krishna, there is the Krishna deity. Deity, Vikraha. So, that is one form of Krishna, the particular deity in a particular temple. So, remembering that form, how do you remember that form? When you go to the temple, you completely concentrate your attention on the form of Krishna as the deity and get the impression in your heart. And carry that impression with you even after you die. Even after you leave the temple and go away to your home or office and remember that form and pray and hear the glories of Krishna from the Bhagavatam. Learn the instructions of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. All this you connect with that remembrance of the form of Krishna. Krishna is my supreme well-wisher. Krishna is my maintainer. Krishna is my beloved Lord. Krishna is the ultimate source of everything. Krishna is full of all unlimited good qualities. Like this, thinking of Krishna, talking about Krishna, remembering Krishna's form within the heart and hearing about Krishna, taking Krishna Prasadam, worshipping the deity of Krishna or picture of the deity of Krishna, all this actually prepares us"

      "transcript": "In the third canto, when Lord Brahma offers His praise to Vishnu, did He offer the prayers before the material creation or after the creation? Now the material creation it's a long process. It begins with the Supreme Lord incarnating in this material world, in the material energy. The Lord enters as the first Vishnu form from the spiritual world who descends into this material energy. So that is called Karanodaka Shaini Vishnu, also called Maha Vishnu. So Maha Vishnu first appears, enters the material energy which is lying in a dormant condition, unmanifest condition. That means at that time there are no universes. Previous destruction took place and there was only the material energy. So that energy first of all Maha Vishnu enters. Then Maha Vishnu agitates that energy and the energy becomes activated by Maha Vishnu's glance. And then after Maha Vishnu's glance, first of all the agitation produces Mahatatva. And Mahatatva differentiates the elements. And those elements are combined to form varieties of material objects, material planets. And then from there is one expansion of this Maha Vishnu called Padmanabha Vishnu or Garbhodaka Shaini Vishnu. So that Garbhodaka Shaini Vishnu from his navel one lotus flower is born. On that Brahma is created by Vishnu."

      "transcript": "And Brahma after his creation, he doesn't know who he is, he doesn't know where he is, he doesn't know what he is supposed to do. So he began searching out for a source and he begins contemplation. Who am I? Where have I come from? What am I supposed to do? Etc, etc. So then Lord Vishnu actually who is seated in the heart of Brahma, he enlightens Brahma, gives knowledge to Brahma and Brahma then understands that he is to do the secondary creation. What is secondary creation? The primary creation is the creation of the ingredients for the creation. That is all the elements earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence, objects, everything is the elements. That is done by Maha Vishnu through agitation of the material energy. Then Brahma, birth of Brahma is done by Garboda Darsahi Vishnu. Then Brahma is given knowledge and enlightenment by Vishnu. Then Brahma can create the living entities, the bodies, living entities means the bodies, he can give the bodies for the living entities. By bringing forth the different varieties of the species. So that gives the bodies to the living entities or helping them take birth in this material world. So that is the work of creation of Brahma. After Brahma is born and already Vishnu has done the work of creation to the point of generating the elements, then Brahma actually does the further work of creation of generating the living beings with their proper bodies in the different planets that take birth according to their past karma. That is work of Brahma to generate the living entities. So before he can actually generate the living entities, he offers prayers to Vishnu"

So they can remain in this cycle unless they are rescued by a pure devotee or the Lord himself. So therefore the prayers offered by Brahma is after the initial phase of, different phases of the creation are done by the two Vishnus and then Brahma's work has to begin of generating the living beings given the material body that is the work of creation of Brahma and that happened before he has to do that he offers nice prayers to"

It's going to be totally different in another one or one and a half years. Lot of work is happening. Next question, is it correct to think that the only way to properly understand complex spiritual matters is by giving up this material body and acquiring the spiritual body? Yes. No, actually, nothing is complex in spiritual subject matter. It is just that it has to be properly explained by a self-realized person, just like Prabhupada explains. Everything he explains very, very simple words and very clearly. Nothing which Prabhupada has written is complex or difficult to understand. That is one thing. Second thing is, we have to actually prepare our consciousness to receive this knowledge without any misconceptions about ourself or misconceptions about Krishna. So to clear the heart of these misconceptions is also a part of preparing oneself to properly"

      "transcript": "If I think I'm the body. If my goal in life is some material sense gratification, many of these things will not make sense to me, even though it is written in a simple way, like Prabhupada and Krishna and Sukhadeva Goswami always explain, you are not the body, you are spirit soul. So somebody who is materialistic will think, what is the spirit soul? I don't agree. I think I am the body. There's nothing beyond the body. Like that, they will not understand. Either they will argue, they will differ in their opinion, or they will think somebody else is in ignorance, or they're having their own concoction. So many wrong ways they can actually interpret something and think it is either think it is very complex, and not bother about understanding what is nicely explained. So, the correct way to understand spiritual subject matter is to prepare oneself by purification of the heart. What is this purification? To clear away the misconceptions which we have developed by long association with this material nature. By long association, we have developed souls. So, purification of the heart. There are so many misconceptions. So, that can all be cleared away, you chant Hare Krishna, you hear the holy name, you understand what Prabhupada is explaining with a sober mind, then it's possible. And gradually you begin to build your foundation, build on a good foundation of understanding. So, that's the correct way. You start with the basic of understanding the basics from the Bhagavad Gita, then you proceed to the Bhagavatam, then to the chaitanya charitamrita. Everything can be understood. And also, Krishna is revealing within the heart for a sincere soul, who has developed the eagerness to know Krishna, to learn about Krishna, to hear about Krishna, develop the taste and attraction for Krishna, hearing about Krishna, Krishna reveals."

Shukadeva Goswami was taught the Bhagavatam by Vyasa Deva. Vyasa Deva composed or compiled the Bhagavatam. Shukadeva Goswami spoke the Bhagavatam to Pariksit Maharaj. Now, in that assembly where Shukadeva Goswami was speaking to Pariksit Maharaj, there were many other saintly persons. So, there was this other saintly person called Suta Goswami. Suta Goswami is the son of one Romaharshana Suta. This Suta Goswami is also called Ugrashrava Suta. He heard the Bhagavatam when Shukadeva Goswami was speaking to Pariksit Maharaj. Suta Goswami was requested by some sages in Naimisharanya, kindly tell us about Krishna. So Suta Goswami said, if you are interested in hearing about Krishna, I shall narrate to you the Srimad Bhagavatam which I heard from Shukadeva Goswami when he was speaking to Pariksit Maharaj. So that Suta Goswami, he's narrating about Krishna. So, that's Suta Goswami. So, this is the reason for repeating the Bhagavatam to the sages of Naimisharanya."

The Srimad Bhagavatam was first spoken by Lord Sankarsana to Sanath Kumara. Sanath Kumara is one of the Four Kumaras. And Sanath Kumara spoke this Bhagavatam what he heard from Sankarsana to one Sankhyayana Muni and this Sankhyayana Muni spoke this Bhagavatam to Parashara.

In the spiritual world, we have our spiritual senses. We have our spiritual body, we have spiritual mind. How can be we doing sense gratification in the spiritual world? How do we be having the mind. Have means the soul has got all these faculties without separate parts, unlike this material body, which is constructed by joining together different parts and interconnecting them in the womb of the mother. So it's a very complex process. But the spiritual spirit soul as a person, the spiritual personality has got all the faculties perfectly working without any separate parts joined together, no separate parts are there. The faculties are all there in the spiritual world. And in the spiritual world, everyone is naturally always blissful, always blissful, the very quality of it, always blissful, always blissful. Being happy is the characteristic of spiritual existence. Whereas the material world, by nature, it is filled with miseries. There is no natural happiness. And one has to seek happiness all the time. And that also is available by some sense contact. Because our nature is to be happy always in the spiritual world, when we come to the material world, we are material world we also want to be always happy, but there is no happiness. So therefore, we seek happiness and only way we can seek happiness is by sense gratification. That means we have to bring the senses in contact with sense objects and that sensation that is produced we think that that is happiness. So that is the defect of material existence."
