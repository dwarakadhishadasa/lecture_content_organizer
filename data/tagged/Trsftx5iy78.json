      "transcript": "We distribute food that is sanctified. It's not about even material purity; when it becomes sanctified by offering to the Lord, with gratitude to the Lord for providing this for existence, that makes it super sanctified, spiritually sanctified. It has got a very curative, healing, transcendental effect for the good of the person who honors sanctified food, and that is what we are distributing. And how is it sanctified? The Lord sanctifies it transcendentally. He sees the—the Lord eats our—it's a mystical process. Every lot is not offered; the Lord knows thousands of people are coming every day. Mass distribution of prasadam means, you know, it's a different kind of, you know, leela of the Lord, you see. Just like shaktivesha nama, Lord shakti enters in it. Similarly, food, when it is offered to the Lord, it is spiritualized food; it is matter."
