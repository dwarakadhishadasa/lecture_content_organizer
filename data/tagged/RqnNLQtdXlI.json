      "transcript": "So, we read from Srimad Bhagavatam, 3rd Canto, Chapter 2, Text 23. The matter of remembrance of Lord Krishna. Translation. Purport. Here is an example of the extreme mercy of Lord, even to his enemy. It is said that a noble man accepts the good qualities of a person of doubtful character, just as one accepts nectar from a stalk of poison. In his babyhood, he was administered deadly poison by Putana, a Shri demon who tried to kill the wonderful baby. And because she was a demon, it was impossible for her to know that the Supreme Lord, even though playing the part of a baby, was no one else than the same Supreme Person. His value as the Supreme Lord did not diminish upon his becoming a baby to please his devotee, Yashoda. The Lord may assume the form of a baby or a shape other than that of a human being, but it doesn't make the slightest difference. He is always the same Supreme. A living creature, however powerful he may become, by dint of severe penance, can never become equal to the Supreme Lord. accepted the motherhood of Putana because she pretended to be an affectionate mother allowing Krishna to suck her breast. The Lord accepts the least qualification of the living entity and awards him the highest reward. That is a standard of his character. Therefore, who but the Lord can be the ultimate"

      "summary": "The speaker emphasizes the importance of associating with devotees (sadhu sangha), avoiding offenses to Vaishnavas, and the significance of surrendering to the Lord through dedication and austerity, particularly in the context of the parikrama.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/RqnNLQtdXlI?t=139",
      "transcript": "shelter. Spiritual life done alone, parikrama done alone, these are all not as powerful as doing it in the company of a shavas, so sadhu sangha, that is the most important thing. And as Bhakti we know said, he decides to do this along with the Sangha of maestro. So we are very fortunate that we get this opportunity to do this, and we pray that we do this parikrama with the least dhamma parath, the least ways from a parath, the least mama parath. We are all coming to light, conditioned souls. So there are chances that we think differently. So we pray that we don't offend the Dham, the Vaishnavas, we go with. The Lord accepts Putana, demoness, because she had that few minutes of affection, at least to show affection. And the Lord has granted her such a high position as his mother. So the Lord does not take our limitations, but the Lord does consider offenses done to another Vaishnava. Offenses done because that shows that we don't recognize his creation, all the living entities. So keeping away from these offenses, respectful to all the Vaishnavas, doing Sankirtan is very important. The Lord will recognize, even though we have limitations, he will recognize that moments of surrender we do to him. So this act of 20 days dedicating to him itself is a surrender. Keeping aside so many things, so many important work would be there, but we keep that aside. So many family responsibilities are there, so many business responsibilities are there. We keep them all aside, and we come and dedicate. That is such a big surrender. The Lord will do that, recognizes these things and the difficulties we may go through, the difficulties to catch up with the team, right, to be together. So all these are different surrender, different different austerities of the mind, austerities of the body. So it's an opportunity to do all these things. So the Lord"

      "transcript": "will recognize that. So here this verse is also apt. With all the limitations, Putana gets a high position. So imagine a small endeavor from our side, how much the Lord would provide, how much the Lord would give credit. Ultimately that is the most important thing, irrespective of what we do, what service we do, what positions we have, what ashram we are in, what order of life we are in, that dedication we have for the Supreme Lord is what all that matters, right? So let us do this sankalpa and continue this parikrama. And this verse is uh very much connected to our parikrama also. This verse was one of the verses which inspired Pundarika Vidyanidhi, whose place we will be visiting, which will be the last of the parikrama in Chattogram. And he shifted from here to Navadvip to take company of the Supreme Lord. And he in Krishna lila, he is considered as Radharani's father, Vishwa Bhanu, king and elderly, very rich, very opulent, very uh what do you call a charming personality with a lot of servants, a lot of perfumes, a lot of"

      "transcript": "wealth. So Gadadhar Pandit had a tinge of doubt, you see a devotee at all, right, who was walking such opulent way. But then who is that Govinda Mukunda who took Gadadhara to Pundarika Vidyanidhi to meet a great devotee. So Gadadhar Pandit saw his house so opulent and he is chewing pan, always red mouth, big couch sitting there. But then I think it is Mukunda who sang this verse. The moment this verse was chanted, Pundarika went into the rapture of of ecstasy and he was like mad man. So seeing that he could understand what a great personality he is. Just by hearing this mercy of the Supreme Lord to Putana, he has gone into this ecstatic position. He kind of threw everything, broke everything in that room. Nobody could control him. He was so mad in love of Krishna. So that is why Gadadhar said, I offended him, now I should take shelter of him, I should take and he took initiation from Pundarika Vidyanidhi and he took initiation from Pundarika Vidyanidhi. So Gadadhar Pandita, an expansion of Radharani, Pundarika, an expansion of Vishwabanna. So they connect, they get connected in Gaur Lila in that form, right? So it's an important verse"
