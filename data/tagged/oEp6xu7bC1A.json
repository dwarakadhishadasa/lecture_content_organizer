Our whole process here, he had a particular material desire in his mind. In our case, if you take an analogy, I repeated earlier also, if we can hear the Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare."

That means attention is uninterrupted. His chant starts from bead one, starts from bead two, starts from bead three, starts from bead four, starts from bead five, starts from bead six, starts from bead seven, goes on, without breaking attention. And attention breakers are, what is the famous attention breaker? Thinking. Thinking is attention breaker. So without thinking, if you can hear Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, that alone is not enough. You should have undiluted intention. Why you should have undiluted intention? Why are you chanting? Forgetting mystic power? Or forgetting association of the Lord as well as mystic power? Then dilution will happen. Undiluted in intention. What is undiluted in intention? What is your intention? Association of the Nama who has"

I am going to meet this person. You have an intention. What is that intention? Something for you. You have an intention, isn't it? Similarly, tendency of the mind is to actually when you are chanting Hare Krishna, something I have to get. Instead, we should simply think, I just want to associate with this Sachidananda Vigraha who is, Shabdavigraha who is before me. Just want to associate. So that consciousness, undiluted attention and undiluted intention. Undiluted attention is a negative thing. We are saying it should not be diluted, but where should the attention be? Fully on the Nama and it should be undiluted. And what should be the intention to associate and please the Lord? That should be the intention of the"

It should not be undiluted by, it should not be diluted by intention for this one, that one, so many other things. It should not be diluted. So if we can chant, this is what we should practice. This is soulful japa. This is the foundation of soulful japa. Then bhavanas are there. That is a different thing. Bhavanas have to naturally come. Or bhavanas have, bhavana should not, our feelings or bhavana in the background, it should only be in the background. Foreground should be completely absorbed in chanting uninterruptedly with undiluted intention for the association of the Lord. So we also have got a big deal. Dhruva Maharaj is taking a lot of tapasya. It didn't happen overnight. Not that he decided and said, I am going to do this. Suddenly he went into this state. No! Six months standing, then he attained that perfection. Similarly, simply today, if you decide, I want to do uninterrupted, undiluted japa. It's not an instant decision. Okay, today's round, undiluted. You should do everyday's japa, you should try to do uninterrupted and undiluted intention. We should do, but you should know it is a process."

      "transcript": "I'll go on like this. More and more we associate with the Lord, the Lord gives us the attraction for uninterrupted. Lord gives us the higher taste by which all the lower taste intentions are, all lower taste different intentions, so you lose all your lower taste by the association of the Lord. So it's a process, continuous process and this is what the tapasya that the devotee has to do. Earlier also one paragraph talked about how the bhakti yogi, a small boy, could achieve this because he was meditating and the Lord helped him. He is not like an impersonalist meditation. He got a guru. Dhruva Maharaj got a guru. Naradarshi gave him the mantra and all those things. So there is a guru and Krishna's help is there. Therefore he became, very quickly attained this tapasya. Similarly, we also have Prabhupada's mercy and Namaprabhu's mercy. By their mercy, this tapasya of uninterrupted giving uninterrupted attention to the Lord with undiluted attention, our intention, our japa will keep progressing and progressing and progressing with the help of Namaprabhu and Srila Prabhupada, guru and Krishna's mercy. So our consciousness becomes, our chitta becomes completely pure, that contaminated consciousness becomes."
