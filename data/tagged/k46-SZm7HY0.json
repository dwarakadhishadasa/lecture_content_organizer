Bhavishyati means will appear in the future. Lord Buddha is a powerful incarnation of the personality of Godhead. Buddha is an empowered incarnation, shaktiavesha avatara. Of course, for us now, Buddha appeared in the past because 5000 years have elapsed since Kali Yuga began. So Buddha came about 2500 years back. He appeared in the province of Gaya, Bihar as a son of Anjana."

      "transcript": "At the time when Lord Buddha appeared, the people in general were atheistic and preferred animosity. They preferred animosity over the animal flesh. On the plea of Vedic sacrifice, every place was practically turned into a slaughterhouse, and animal killing was indulged in unrestrictedly. Lord Buddha preached non-violence, taking pity on the poor animals."

      "transcript": "He preached that he did not believe in the tenets of the Vedas, and stressed the adverse psychological effect of non-violence incurred by animal killing. When the Vedas are not accepted through the authoritative disciplic succession, the casual readers of the Vedas are misled by the flowery language of that system of knowledge. They have no depth of knowledge. Now, animal killing is specifically allowed in the Vedic sacrifices to test the power of the mantra being chanted by a particular Brahman. What is done is an old cow or an old bull is offered in sacrifice, but after that sacrifice the animal is revived. The soul in the animal's body is getting a new body."

The whole system of the Vedas is to lead one gradually to the path of the Supreme Lord, to know the Supreme Lord, the individual soul, the cosmic situation, and the relation between all these items. When the relation is known, the relative function begins. Thus the faithless people were made to believe in God in the form of Lord Buddha. That was the mercy of Lord Buddha. He made the faithless faithful to him."
