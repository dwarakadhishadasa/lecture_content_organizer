      "transcript": "In this session, we will be discussing from the 9th verse of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Shreemad Bhagavatam: शाउनकव वाच. Now, after सूतकव स्वामी said that व्यास देवा taught the Shreemad Bhagavatam to his own son, immediately शाउनकव interrupts सूतकव स्वामी and asks a very, very important question. Kindly hear this question very attentively: शाउनकव वाच सवै निवृत्ति निरतहा सर्वत्रो पेक्षको मुनिही कस्यवा ब्रहतीम एताम आत्मा रामस समभ्यसत. The meaning is Shri Shounaka asked सूतकव स्वामी, \"Shri Shukadev Goswami was already on the path of self-realization, and thus he was pleased with his own self, आत्मा रामा. Why did he take the trouble to undergo the self-realization, the study of such a vast literature? भागवत्म is no small literature, 18,000 verses. Why did he undergo the trouble when he was already on the path of self-realization?\" So, in the purport, Srila Prabhupada explains, \"For the people in general, the highest perfection of life is to cease from material activities and be fixed on the path of self-realization.\" फहा कि first काथवित है कि Cease for material activity means that these material activities are activities which are aimed at sense gratification. Sense gratification means the senses are always demanding some pleasure, some pleasing object of the senses. For the eyes, it is a beautiful form; for the ears, it is some melodious music or some praise. For the tongue, it is some palliative beauty. For the tongue, it is some palliative beauty. For the tongue, it is some palliative beauty."

      "summary": "The speaker explains that Srimad Bhagavatam is beyond material enjoyment and even liberation, making it a postgraduate study for Atma-ramas, those who are self-satisfied.",

      "transcript": "Soul pleasure of the self. Atma means self, and arama means to take pleasure. Everyone is searching after the highest pleasure, but the standard of pleasure of one may be different from the standard of another. Of course, everybody wants pleasure, but the standard may not be the same. Therefore, the standard of pleasure enjoyed by the karmis, the materialistic persons, is different from that of the atma rama's, the transcendentalists. The atma rama's are completely indifferent to material enjoyment in every respect. Why is Srila Prabhupada mentioning this? Because he is trying to explain what is the need for Shukadeva Goswami to undertake study of this vast literature when he was already self-satisfied. What is the impetus? So, Srila Prabhupada says atma rama's are indifferent to material enjoyment. They are not interested in material enjoyment. Srila Shukadeva Goswami had already attained that stage. What stage? The stage of atma rama, taking pleasure in the self or the soul, and still he was attracted to undergo the trouble of studying the great Bhagavatam literature. So, there is an important conclusion here from this stage that Srimad Bhagavatam is stronglyуетing the atma rama's behavior. This means that Shrima Bhagavatam is a post-graduate study even for the atmarama's who have to surpass all the studies of Vedic knowledge. Atmarama's are not interested in any materials stuff, so why would they study Bhagavatam? Because Bhagavatam has got nothing to do with material sense enjoyment. It's completely transcendentalized. The atma vas or say the atma vow has nothing to do with the material sense of knowledge. The atma bhas not been interested in Padm Prim mommy or dealt with."

      "transcript": "happiness is much, much, much, much more than spiritual happiness. What is the comparison? But there is something to say is that if you were to be able to get an ocean of spiritual happiness, then that ocean of spiritual happiness cannot equal even one drop of devotional happiness. There is a comparison in the book, that is something. So, devotional happiness is the happiness that is the happiness derived by devotional service to Krishna when Krishna reciprocates the devotees and service devotional service. So, that is billions and trillions of times more than any spiritual happiness also. So, that happiness is what is there in the Bhagavatam, that devotional happens. And there are so many examples given in the Bhagavatam how different great devotees, pure devotees, they experience this bliss of devotional happiness. And such pure devotees who experience devotional happiness, they deride even the conception of liberation. One great devotee, Billamangal Thakur, he says, \"Ever since I am engaged in devotional service and I'm experiencing devotional happiness, I don't care for liberation, but liberation comes and waits as my maid servant, how can I serve?\" So, this is the position of a pure devotee, that a pure devotee is uninterested in liberation. Certainly, a pure devotee is never interested in any material happiness. A pure devotee is not even interested in any kind of liberation. There are five kinds of liberation, but a pure devotee is not interested in any of the kinds of liberation. He is simply interested in serving Krishna because that is the source of unlimited transcendental bliss called the devotional happiness. So, Bhagavatam is filled with that. Simply by sitting and hearing Srimad Bhagavatam from the proper source, one has access to this devotional happiness. We get a glimpse of that when we begin Sankirtana. In Sankirtana, there is some kind of experience of happiness which one has never experienced before, and that is very, very, very unique. But that is only a brief glimpse we get in the beginning of our Krishna Consciousness. We have to cleanse our heart and become fixed up in devotional service to be"
