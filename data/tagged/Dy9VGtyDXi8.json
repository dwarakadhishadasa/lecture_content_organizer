      "transcript": "Translation on purpose by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada. Translation: It is my good fortune that I have been able to see you, for you cannot easily be seen by persons who have not subdued the mind or controlled the senses. I am all the more fortunate to have touched my head to the blessed dust of your feet. Purport by Srila Prabhupada: The perfection of transcendental life can be achieved simply by touching the holy dust of the feet of a holy man. In the Bhagavatam it is said, mahat pada rajo 'bhishekam, which means to be blessed by the holy dust of the lotus feet of a mahat, or great devotee. As stated in Bhagavad Gita, mahatmanas tu, those who are great souls are under the spell of spiritual energy, and their symptom is that they fully engage in Krishna consciousness for the service of the Lord. Therefore, they are called mahatmas. Unless one is fortunate enough to have the dust of the lotus feet of a mahatma on one's head, there is no possibility of perfection in spiritual life. The parampara system of disciplic succession is very important as a means of spiritual success. One becomes a mahat by the grace of his mahat spiritual master. If one takes shelter of the lotus feet of a great soul, there is every possibility of one's also becoming a great soul. When Maharaj Rahugana asked Jadabharata about his wonderful achievements of spiritual success, he replied to the king that spiritual success is not possible simply by following the rituals of religion or simply by converting oneself into a sanyasi or offering sacrifices as recommended in the scriptures. These methods are undoubtedly helpful for spiritual realization, but the real effect is brought about by the grace of a mahatma. By the grace of a mahatma, in Vishvanatha Chakravarti Thakura's eight stanzas of prayers to the spiritual master, it is clearly stated that simply by satisfying the spiritual master, one can achieve the supreme success in life, and in spite of executing all ritualistic performances, if one cannot satisfy the spiritual master, one has no access to spiritual perfection. Here the word akritatmanam is very significant. Atma means body, soul, or mind, and akritatma means the common man who cannot control the senses or the mind. Because the common man is unable to control the senses and the mind, it is his duty to seek the shelter of a great soul or a great devotee of the Lord and just try to please him. That will make his life perfect. A common man cannot rise to the topmost stage of spiritual realization simply by following the rituals and religious principles. He has to take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and work under his direction faithfully and sincerely, then he becomes perfect without a doubt."

      "transcript": "They are in the place of pilgrimages. People go to the place of pilgrimage, then they take their blessings. This is the culture, sanatana dharma culture. So here we see that Manu is praising the value of contacting the dust of a great personality. You have been released, released for hot, for top, told, om, and there are unlimited ways in which this mercy is actually transmitted, and we can list so many things which for our senses like prasadam. By contacting the prasadam, we get mercy with our tongue. By having darshana of the deities, we get mercy. By hearing, by hearing, we get mercy. By worshiping, we get mercy. By taking, we get mercy. One more item is here which is highly potent for making advancement in spiritual life. What is that? The dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee. This is not metaphorical; it is actually the real dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee. If one is able to place the dust on his head, then one gets special mercy. These are all ways of receiving the mercy which are not phenomenally calculatable through some material phenomena. What is the value of a dust? Take the dust of the lotus feet of Prabhupada. Here is deity, whole day deity is here. Some dust will collect. Water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, and us upyogation to bahut karenge."

      "summary": "This segment explains that spiritual relationships and transcendental knowledge are not transactional, and that true understanding and realization come through the personal mercy of a pure devotee, like Srila Prabhupada, not just through mechanical reading or rituals.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/Dy9VGtyDXi8?t=653",
      "transcript": "So this is the meaning of mercy. Our mind is always used to transactional things. That means, you know, I pay for it, I get it. Our relationship, spiritual relationship with the deity, relationship with the holy name, our relationship with the spiritual master, our relationship with Vaishnavas, we cannot think in terms of a transaction. What do you get from Srila Prabhupada? No, I get transcendental knowledge. How do you get transcendental knowledge? Because books are there, I read, I get transcendental knowledge. Just by reading, you don't get transcendental knowledge. When you read, Prabhupada should act on you through these pages, then you get transcendental mercy, then you get mercy, then you get understanding, then you get realization. So one should understand that reading Prabhupada's books or anything, contacting any of the forms of mercy of the Lord is not something that can be mechanically, ritualistically achieved. That Prabhupada explains it, just by ritual one cannot, you know, get it done by the Lord. It is bhakti. Even if one chants 16 rounds, it may help, Prabhupada is saying it may help, but he will have no access to spiritual perfection. Access to spiritual perfection means you have to get the personal mercy of a pure devotee, not general mercy. General mercy is available. Prabhupada's books are available everywhere, general mercy. Personal mercy means yes, Prabhupada gets linked to you when you get initiated, he links to you and he is your personal spiritual master. He is not only teaching you, there are so many other things he is doing to you. He is monitoring to you. He and Chaitya Guru together is monitoring to you, monitoring your growth, spiritual growth."

      "transcript": "Therefore, the Vaishnavas always say that I am made up of the mercy of my spiritual master. Whatever I have is a kripa of my spiritual master. If I have some standing, if I have some detachment, it is given by my spiritual master. I have not earned it. He believes it. I have not earned it. Why? Because he understands that actually by any bodily action, by tongue, moving your tongue sixteen rounds and all, you cannot get bhakti. You can get bhakti when you move sixteen rounds. It will give you some foundation, but ultimately you have to get the personal mercy of the spiritual master which comes by, here Prabhupada is giving that secret here, by serving a bona fide spiritual master, by serving him one gets that. Because the common man is unable to control the spiritual life, and the mind, it is his duty to seek shelter of a great soul or a great devotee of the Lord and just try to please him. Just see, do service to him and try to please him, then even if you cannot control your senses and mind, still by his mercy you will purify. Very soon you will be able to control your senses."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/Dy9VGtyDXi8?t=988",
      "transcript": "So therefore one should understand that the easiest, though we may do all the exercises that we are trying to do, so many secondary instructions are there, control this, shamas, damas, tapas, all these things are there. We are trying to follow all those things. While following those things, one should understand that the result of the real perfection or the result of all that comes only by the personal mercy of the spiritual master, and this has to be practiced by the devotee because you don't see with your eyes. It is a matter of faith. From this yasya prasadat bhagavata prasadat, everyday we are singing, but we cannot see how it is happening. When you see something, somebody gives you something, you know, gross in your hand, you say thank you because you see he has given, but we have to learn how to transcendentally see this through the descending process that everyday we have to say thank you, thank you, thank you. Every moment we have to go on saying thank you, thank you, thank you to Srila Prabhupada, to Guru and Krishna. Continuously they are giving. So what is the spiritual process of spiritual advancement, spiritual progress in our Sampradaya? It is always beg for the mercy of the devotees, beg for the mercy of the Vaishnavas. Then one may think what is my role? Shouldn't I do anything? No, one should do, but one should understand that what one does is simply to show our attitude to the spiritual master that I am serious about it, I want your mercy, I am serious about following your instruction. Just like the story in Bhagavad Gita, Prabhupada explains about the sparrow trying to recover her eggs from the ocean. She was so determined that she was trying to take out drop by drop water through her beaks and trying to empty the ocean, but finally her, obviously, you know, by material calculation, can a sparrow empty the ocean? Not possible. Her goal was what? To get the eggs back, but then she got mercy of Garuda. She got the egg back. Why was Garuda attracted? Because of her determination. In the same way, to attract the mercy of the Lord, it is not the quantum of skill, the quantum of what you have given and all these things is not what the attitude, if the attitude to attract the mercy of the Lord is there."

You have to do, but as far as result is concerned, one should not think my effort was a very big factor. As far as doing is concerned, yes, I have to do. I cannot spare anything. I have to do. As far as result is concerned, oh, I chanted so many years very nicely, now I have advanced. You can say that I have chanted nicely so long for by Prabhupada's mercy my chanting has become fruitful.

      "transcript": "Just like let us say we hear Srimad Bhagavatam class. It is said that one has to submissively hear. You can submissively hear, you can intellectually hear also. When you intellectually hear, you will only get the ideas. When you submissively hear, you will get the feelings of the speaker. When somebody speaks, he speaks what? Ideas, feelings, realization, right? He speaks. You submissively hear, then the feelings also you get, and the feelings go. The transformation that happens for a person is faster when you can get the feelings of, let us say, Prabhupada's feelings. If you put a filter of only intellectual thing, let us say Prabhupada lecture you are hearing, ok, ok, philosophical, philosophical, all these things intellectually you are adjusting, but Prabhupada says rascal, then you know it is nothing philosophical. It is not a philosophical idea at all. You get the feeling why Prabhupada is calling this fellow rascal. So that submissiveness is, if you have submissiveness, how will you have submissiveness? Only when there is anticipation you will have submissiveness, otherwise, oh, you would be submissive. Oh, I am expecting something, anticipating. So anticipating mercy of deity, you go before the deity, you have to have anticipation. It does not mean specific prayers, but there is mercy coming. Chanting Hare Krishna, you have to have anticipation of mercy, being in the presence of a spiritual master, you should get anticipate. So there has to be preparedness for receiving this mercy also, and the rational mind is the biggest enemy."

We can all rationally analyze and somehow to control the senses and all these things rationally analyze. That's what the mayavadhis, impersonalists do. They rationally they analyze what is self concept and this and that all those things. And as devotees, when the right time comes, he comes out of the bodily concept. Now that's what it said, when you have bhakti, you have knowledge also. Bhakti never stands without knowledge. There is knowledge always. There is a very foundation is knowledge. Bhakti is not foundation is not ignorance is knowledge. Knowledge of truth, tattva is always there as a foundation. So how much we should apply our intelligence? Don't over endeavor.
