      "transcript": "The meaning of this verse is, as long as Vitura played the part of a Shudra, being cursed by Manduka Muni, Arhyama officiated at the post of Yamaraj to punish those who committed sinful acts. So in the Purport, Shila Prabhupada explains, already it has been told that Vitura was actually Yamaraj. Yamaraj was a Shudra. Yamaraj was cursed due to a small mistake, a slight mistake he did, in carrying out his official responsibility. And he was cursed by Manduka Muni. And therefore, he was born as Vitura in the womb of a Shudra woman. But actually, Prabhupada explains, the real reason why it was actually a higher arrangement by the Supreme Lord, that Yamaraj actually was cursed to take birth like that. So the hidden meaning of this particular incident is very nicely explained by Prabhupada in the Purport. So Shila Prabhupada says, Vitura, born in the womb of a Shudra woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage, along with his brothers Dhritarashtra and Pandu. If I may refresh your memory about who is Vitura, in terms of his relationship with Dhritarashtra and Pandu, all the three are sons of Vichitravirya, but they are posthumous children. They were born after Vichitravirya's death. And how were they born after Vichitravirya's death? This is called Deva-rena-suton-patti. That means, if a person is unable to conceive children, whatever may be the reason, why such a person, such a person is unable to conceive a child. The emperor of the world, he has to have sons who can succeed him. Qualified, capable, trained up sons. But Vichitravirya died untimely. So then there was nobody to ascend the throne. So then the mother of Vichitravirya, Satyavati, the wife of Shantanu, Vichitravirya's father, he, sorry, Satyavati, she called Vyasadeva and asked for a solution to this problem. So Vyasadeva agreed to impregnate the wives of Vichitravirya, Ampika and Ambalika, two queens. But it so happened that Vyasadeva, even though Vyasadeva was in perfect consciousness, but because he was undergoing severe austerities before he came to impregnate these wives of his brother, Deva and Sutrapati, means conceiving a child by the brother in the womb of one's own wife. So Vyasadeva was the son of Satyavati before her marriage with Shantanu. So Vyasadeva was called upon to impregnate these two queens so that they'll be good progeny for later on occupying the throne. So Dhritarashtra and Pandu were conceived by the two queens, but both of them were not conceived properly. So therefore, in order to conceive a third child, and one of the queens was asked to conceive a third child, but she, instead of conceiving one more child, she asked her maid to go in her place to conceive a child. And that royal maid actually was in very proper consciousness, and therefore, Vyasadeva conceived in that womb of the maiden, a maid servant, Yamaraj, who was cursed to be born as the son of a maid servant. So that was Vidura. So Vidura is actually a step-brother of Dhritarashtra and Pandu. So Dhritarashtra and Pandu were the two sons conceived in the queen. Even though they are conceived by Vyasadeva, they are considered sons of Vichitramirya. All the three are considered sons of Vichitramirya. But the son of the maid servant doesn't have the same position in terms of inheritance like the sons of the queen. So Dhritarashtra and Pandu inherited whatever the royal opulence, but entitled to inherit, but Vidura, as the son of a maid servant, was not entitled for that. So therefore, Srila Prabhupada is saying, Vidura, born in the womb of a Shudra woman, was forbidden even to be a party of royal heritage along with his brothers, Dhritarashtra and Pandu."

      "summary": "This segment addresses the question of how Vidura, born a Shudra, could instruct learned Kshatriyas, explaining that spiritual qualification and transcendental knowledge are more important than birth.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/Gz918Ho68hY?t=476",
      "transcript": "So the question is being raised, how could Vidura occupy the post of a preacher to instruct such learned kings and Kshatriyas as Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Yudhishtira? If he is the son of a maid servant and he doesn't even have any inheritance, what is his authority to instruct and preach such learned Kshatriyas as Dhritarashtra and Maharaj Yudhishtira? So Srila Prabhupada gives the answer. The first answer is that even though it is accepted that Vidura was a Shudra by birth, because he renounced the word for spiritual enlightenment, by the authority of Rishi Maitreya, and was thoroughly educated by him in transcendental knowledge, he was quite competent to occupy the post of an Acharya, spiritual preceptor. So always the scriptures say, irrespective of birth, if somebody is trained up and has got the qualities of a Brahmana or a Kshatriya or even a Vaisya, even though he may be born in a Shudra family or a Shudra woman, still he is accepted as a Brahmana, Kshatriya or Vaisya according to qualification, training, the qualities he displays, etc. So Vidura was actually Yamaraja himself and even though he was born in the womb of a Shudra woman, he had all the good qualities because of which he was in a position to renounce and seek spiritual enlightenment by Maitreya Rishi and he was also thoroughly educated by Maitreya Rishi in transcendental knowledge. Therefore he was competent to occupy the post of an Acharya or a spiritual preceptor. Now Srila Prabhupada percourses Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. According to Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, anyone who is conversant in the transcendental knowledge or the science of Godhead, be he a Brahmana or a Shudra, a householder or a Sannyasi, kiba vipra kiba nyasi, shudra kenanaya, he Krishna tattva veta, he is a Brahman. If a person is born as a Shudra or if he is a Brahmana or in terms of ashrama, in terms of varana, whether he is a Brahmana or a Shudra doesn't matter. In terms of ashrama, whether he is a householder or a Sannyasi doesn't matter. As long as he is conversant with transcendental knowledge or the science of Krishna consciousness, he is a Brahmana. In terms of Akshara, he is a Brahmana of Krishna consciousness, he is eligible to become a spiritual master."

      "transcript": "ये कृष्ण तत्व वेव्तकृ। One who knows in truth that science of Krishna consciousness, such a person, से गुरु होये, he is qualified to occupy the post of a spiritual master, a spiritual preceptor, a guru, a qualified guru. Now Prabhupada also quotes Chanakya Pandit. Even in the ordinary moral quotes mentioned by Chanakya Pandit, the great politician and moralist, there is no harm in taking lessons from a person who may be by birth less than a Shudra, provided that person is qualified to impart lessons. So this birth is not important at all. That's what the Acharyas have taught us, that is what the scriptures teach us. That's what even Chanakya Pandit says. This is one part of the answer that Vidura is qualified. He has undergone thorough training by Maitreya Rishi. He has renounced the world for the sake of gaining spiritual enlightenment. So exceptionally qualified, even though he has taken birth in the womb of a maidservant."

      "summary": "This segment provides the second part of the answer, explaining that Vidura was actually the incarnation of Yamaraj, one of the twelve Mahajanas, and therefore an authority on Dharma.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/Gz918Ho68hY?t=752",
      "transcript": "That's the first part of the answer. Next is the other part of the reply for that question that was raised. How is he competent to instruct somebody like the Dhrashtra or Maharaja Yudhishthira? The second part of the answer is Vidura was not actually a Shudra. He was to play the part of a so-called Shudra for one hundred years being cursed by Manduka Muni. He was the incarnation of Yamaraj. And who is Yamaraj? Yamaraj is one of the twelve Mahajanas. Mahajanas means they are the authorities on Dharma. In the whole universe there are twelve Mahajanas. So Yamaraj is one of the twelve Mahajanas on the level with such exalted personalities as the other Mahajanas, Brahma, Narada, Shiva, Kapila, Bhishma, Prahlada, etc. So all these Mahajanas are the most exalted personalities in the whole universe. They are authorities on Dharma. So being a Mahajana, it is the duty of Yamaraj to preach the cult of devotion to the people of the world, as Narada, Brahma and other Mahajanas do. All the Mahajanas are first-class Mahabhagavatas, top-class Vaishnavas. And they preach the science of Krishna Consciousness to everyone. They are the most competent preachers of Krishna Consciousness. So, Prabhupada explains further. But Yamaraj is always busy in his platonic kingdom, punishing the doers of sinful acts. Yamaraj has got a duty. Even though he is a Mahajana, he is qualified, but he has got this duty of punishing the wrongdoers. So, he generally doesn't have much time to take leave from his responsible office of punishing the wrongdoers."

      "summary": "This segment concludes by stating that Yamaraj took birth as Vidura to participate in Krishna Leela and that as a pure devotee, he is transcendental to all social divisions, making him qualified to preach to anyone.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/Gz918Ho68hY?t=885",
      "transcript": "Therefore, Yamaraj wanted to preach the glories of the Lord. By the will of the Lord, he was cursed to be born as a son of a Shudra. But he took birth at a time when Krishna had appeared as an incarnation. So, he participated in Krishna Leela. And also, he is an exalted devotee. Even though he is cursed, his consciousness doesn't become affected by the birth, because his activities are always those of a devotee in any body, in any situation, in any position. He is always a pure devotee, Mahabhagavata, fixed up in his position as a pure devotee. So, such a devotee is never a Shudra, or a Brahmana, or a householder, or a sannyasi. He is transcendental to all divisions of varna and ashrama. So, therefore, he is the most authorized and competent and most appropriate person to preach to anyone in the whole universe what to speak of preaching to Dhritarashtra. So, this is the explanation given. We should always understand him, Vidura, to be greater than the purest Brahmana because he is a pure devotee. He is also a Mahajan. Hare Krishna. I will stop here."
