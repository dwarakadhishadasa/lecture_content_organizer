      "transcript": "I said Japa is not merely a process. Japa for a beginner, it is a process because he has to align his mind and senses, all those things, towards the right way of Japa. But eventually, Japa is a relationship with Krishna. In two hours you're sitting and chanting, it's a relationship with Krishna, just like you go and sit near your loved ones and spend time. The same way we spend time talking to Krishna because today, spiritually, we do not know any other spiritual vocabulary. We are not awakened, so only one vocabulary we know today, which the Guru has given us. What is it? Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. This is our talk with Krishna, sound incarnation. God says that's good enough. Just go on chanting."
