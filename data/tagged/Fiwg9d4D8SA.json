      "transcript": "Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Narayanam Namaskritya Naramchaiva Narottamam Devi Saraswati Vyasam Tato Jayam Udhirayam. In this session, we will be discussing from the 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This is a fresh session which is continuing from the previous session. Previous session we discussed part 1 of this 38th verse, now we will discuss part 2 and in the next session we will discuss part 3 because there is a very big purport here written by Srila Prabhupada. So I will just read this verse once again, 38th verse of the 17th chapter of the first canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Suta Vacha Abhyarthitas Tadatasmai Sthanani Kalaye Dadau Deutam Panam Striya Suna Yatra Adharma Chatur Vidhah. The meaning of this verse is, Suta Goswami said, Maharaj Pariksit, thus being petitioned by the personality of Kali, gave him permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were performed. So Maharaj Pariksit gave Kali Purusha four places, Deutam Panam Striya Suna, Deutam means gambling, Panam means drinking, Pras and Striya means prostitution and Suna means animal slaughter."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/Fiwg9d4D8SA?t=157",
      "transcript": "So we discussed in the previous session that the basic principles of irreligiosity, they counteract the four principles of religion. And we discussed how counteraction happens in the previous session. Now, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport further, the personality of Kali was given permission to live in four places particularly mentioned by the king. Namely, the place of gambling, the place of prostitution, the place of drinking, and the place of animal slaughter. Four specific places were given for Kali Purusha by Maharaj Pariksit. So, now something about what is Dharma and what is Adharma as regards these four activities are specifically explained by Srila Prabhupada, with reference to Srila Jeeva Goswami's commentary on this verse in his writings. Srila Jeeva Goswami is one of the six Goswamis, the direct disciples of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the next part of the purport, Srila Jeeva Goswami directs the drunken people and the unmarried woman with the five principles of the scriptures that drinking against the principles of scriptures, such as the Sautramaaniyagna, association with woman outside of marriage, killing animals against the injunctions of scriptures, are irreligious. Irreligious means Adharma. Three things are specifically mentioned. Drinking against the principles of scriptures, association with women outside marriage, killing animals against the injunction of scriptures are all adharma or all irreligious."

      "transcript": "Now we have to carefully understand what does it mean that these acts are irreligious only if they are against the scriptures and what do scriptures allow in terms of drinking, illicit connection with women and or rather association with women and killing animals. What do scriptures allow? scriptures say so Prabhupada first of all clarifies in the Vedas two different types of injunctions are there for the pravrittas and for the nivrittas so dharma or scriptural injunctions are there differently explained for two different categories of persons who are the pravrittas pravrittas are those who are engaged in material enjoyment and nivrittas are those who are liberated for from material bondage so pravrittas who are regular ordinary people they are somehow in ignorance and they are engaged in material enjoyment so what is the scriptural injunctions of practicing Dharma for the normal people ordinary people the pravartas those engaged in material enjoyment and what are those scriptural injunctions specifically meant for nivrittas or those liberated from material bondage there are different injunctions so Srila Prabhupada further says the Vedic injunction for the pravartas the ordinary people those engaged in material enjoyment is to gradually regulate their activities towards the path of liberation so the injunctions in this scriptural injunctions are the same as the pravartas scriptures are meant to regulate the activities of the ordinary common people so that these common people progress towards liberation not that they follow the scriptures and they remain in bondage no the aim of the Vedas whether it is for the pravartas or nivrittas is ultimately to free them from material bondage and to help them progress after becoming liberated to go back to Godhead we should not forget this merely attaining liberation from material bondage is not enough there is a further progress to be made after liberation to go back to Godhead where we all belong"

      "transcript": "so do not pray to Lord Shiva for anything else but only to improve one's health in hell so these injunctions in the scriptures are only for thumbsick people it is not meant for every one so Shruthi Prabhupada says one man's food may be poisoned for others similarly what is recommended for those in the mode of ignorance may be poisoned for those in the mode of goodness Srila Jiva Goswami Prabhupada says that recommendations in the scriptures for certain class of men are never to be considered adharma or irreligious for them but in general for people who are not in the tamasic stage all such activities are never to be encouraged and they are factually adharma for sattvic people and rajasic people the recommendations like soutramani yajna etc are actually not to be followed for them all sorts of recommendations like that are not to be followed for them all sorts of meat-eating and all sorts of drinking liquor are prohibited so therefore one has to be very careful that simply because the shastras allow for a certain class of people some animal sacrifice or offering of wine in some yagna and then partaking the remnants doesn't mean everyone can do it no so this clarification Srila Prabhupada is giving in the purport to this particular verse the 38th verse which says that Kali Purusha was given four places and one has to be careful and the later verses and purports will clarify this more I"
