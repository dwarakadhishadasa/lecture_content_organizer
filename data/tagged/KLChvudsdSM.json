      "transcript": "Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came from Navadip to Puri. He came to Puri because his mother requested him not to go to Vrindavan. After taking Sanyas, he wanted to go to Vrindavan. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to go to Vrindavan after Sanyas, but then Nithyananda Prabhu tricked him. Instead of going to Vrindavan, he showed the way towards Shantipur, which is Advaita Acharya's house. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was in ecstasy. He had no idea where he was going. He wanted to go to Vrindavan, but Nithyananda Prabhu brought him to Shantipur, Advaita Acharya's house. And Advaita Acharya called Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mother, Sachi Mata, because now he has become a mendicant, he has become a Sanyasi. He will go away to Vrindavan or other places. Mother will not be able to see Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Already the mother is in great pain. So, Advaita Acharya brought Sachi Mata to Shantipur so Chaitanya Mahaprabhu could meet her. So, one request Sachi Mata had was that he doesn't go to Vrindavan, that he make his headquarters in Jagannath Puri, because in Jagannath Puri and Calcutta, devotees always come and go. So, she said, \"I will get some information about you. I will hear about you from people who come from Jagannath Puri. So, please make your residence in Jagannath Puri.\" So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu made his residence in Jagannath Puri."

      "transcript": "That is how he came from Navadip to Jagannath Puri and made this his headquarters. Of course, he went around India twice. He went to Vrindavan also, but Jagannath Puri was his permanent place for 18 years, out of which 12 years he was in Gambhira. We visited Gambhira before going to Jagannath Temple, a small house. Gambhira means deep inside the house. The most innermost portion of the house is called Gambhira, and that is where all the treasure is kept. In any house, they don't keep your treasure in the outer rooms. The most inner room, that is where treasure is kept. So, the treasure called Chaitanya was also residing. So, that's why it is called Gambhira. He resided there for 12 years totally immersed in separation with Krishna."

      "transcript": "So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, when he came to Puri, he, in ecstasy, he knew where Tota Gopinath Deity was hidden or submerged. They say most of Puri was, it was a hill, Nilachala Parvata. Where is the Parvata now? So, there is no more Parvata. They say this whole place has been flattened by the sand of the beach before it was a hill. So, probably the Deity was submerged. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu knew where this was hidden. He knew where this Deity of Tota Gopinath was, and he dug with his hand. So, he himself lifted this Deity from earth, Tota Gopinath, installed there, and every day he would visit. So, we visited Gambhira."

      "transcript": "That is the place Chaitanya Mahaprabhu stayed last 12 years. Then we went to Siddha Bhakur. That is a bhajan kutir of Haridasa Chakur. And you saw the 500 years old Bakula tree, which is in different shape now, looks like a snake, but that is a tree. But the top portion, all the green leaves are still there. And then Tota Gopinath. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu wound up his pastime after 48 years, 24 years as Grahastha and 24 years as Sanyasi. He wound up his pastime at Tota Gopinath by merging into the Deity of Tota Gopinath. After that, Gadadhar Pandita made his house in Tota Gopinath. And Gadadhar Prabhu, he merged into the Deity of Radharani in Tota Gopinath. So, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Gadadhar both merged into the temple of Tota Gopinath, to Deity of Tota Gopinath and Radharani."
