      "transcript": "implicated because of which we can lead a happy, healthy, prosperous life in this world. While that is partially correct, it is not the complete truth. Under the influence of illusion, we don't take note of the fact that there are four fundamental miseries and three kinds of fundamental other miseries which are imposed upon everyone in the whole material creation, beginning from Brahma down to the most insignificant creature. Brahma, situated in the highest mode of goodness, even he is a father of all good things, and he is afraid of death. Even he is in anxiety. Even he ran, as Paula terrorized the whole universe. So nobody is freed from fear, anxiety, sadhassa mudbhikta GnadiBS asad grahat. You accept material existence via this material body and you're forced to suffer four fundamental miseries, janma, mrutyu, jara, vyadhi, dukkha, dosha, anu, darshanam. I mentioned this several times in the past, and also the three impositions of material nature, adhi daivika klesha, adhyatmika klesha, adhibhautika klesha. Everyone suffers this throughout the universe."

      "transcript": "So, we cannot be completely free from all suffering in material existence simply by performing pious activities, materially pious activities. So, that is particularly highlighted in the spiritual knowledge given in this book, in the Vedas. While people are engrossed in the material knowledge, either given by modern books of knowledge, or given by the Vedas, they forget the ultimate reality of material existence, which in essence is simply suffering. All those who have born, have to die. In the Bhagavad Gita, second chapter, Krishna says, of one who has taken birth in this material world, it is certain that such person will have to die. And the example is in the Bhagavatam, here are Nikashipa who wanted to be immortal in that very body that he had taken birth, and Brahma said, no, you cannot be immortal in this body, nobody can be immortal, even Brahma cannot be immortal in the same body in which he has taken birth, even he has to leave his body. Therefore, the Vedas instruct us, especially Bhagavad Gita, which gives the essence of the Vedic wisdom, the spiritual wisdom in the Vedas, that you are spirit soul, and as spirit soul, you are entitled to spiritual bliss, eternal life of spiritual bliss and spiritual knowledge, Satchidananda, state of existence, and that is possible by realizing yourself as spiritual by nature, same quality as Krishna, the Supreme."

      "transcript": "And such realization is perfected by Krishna consciousness, by bhakti yoga, not by any other method. Therefore, Srila Prabhupada says, the knowledge of the Vedas ultimately aims at perfection of self-realization. In other words, Srila Prabhupada says, the Vedas are the guides for the civilized man in every respect, since human life is the opportunity to get free from all material miseries, it is properly guided by the knowledge of the Vedas in the matters of both material needs and spiritual salvation. Material needs and spiritual salvation. Material necessities are there of the body, but that is very easy, taken care of by following the Vedic directions and most importantly if we follow the Vedas then we can also achieve spiritual salvation, spiritual liberation. There is a material conception of liberation where one merely thinks that let me become free from all material problems or material miseries or material bondage, but merely becoming free from all material bondage without realizing one's own spiritual self is imperfect, why? Because as spirit soul we are, we are always active. We are always active. We cannot be inactive. We cannot be without activity, a spirit soul. So those who become free from"

It is one of the most important aspects that life libretto lives are Graveос in mining and efflores advisory services a month prior to their mark from material bondage by any process other than bhakti, but do not realize their spiritual self, they actually do not sustain their state of freedom from material bondage because they do not know about the activities after becoming free from material bondage. If they are not engaged in pure devotional service to Krishna, so pure devotional service to Krishna is not only freedom from material bondage but also engagement in the spiritual state of existence, active service to Krishna, spiritual state of existence. So therefore we need not only to fulfill the demands of this body, the material needs, but also work for attaining the spiritual state of existence beyond this material existence."

      "transcript": "And that is possible only by bhakti, bhakti yoga. Further, Srila Prabhupada says, the specific intelligent class of men who were devoted particularly to the knowledge of the vedas were called the vipras or the graduates of the vedic knowledge. There are four stages of this development in terms of the brahmanical culture. What do the scriptures say? Janmana jayate shudra, by birth everybody is ignorant. Shudra here means one is born ignorant. Please explain in the Bhagavad-Gita also, icha dvesha samuthena dvandva mohena bharata sarva bhutani sammoham sargayanti parantapa. Everyone is born into ignorance in this material world, even if one takes birth in a brahmana family with good parents, very nice cultured family, very nice, one may have a very nice upbringing, but it is necessary to actually undergo samskara, purification, cultural purification, even after taking birth in a brahmana family. And that's what exactly Yudhishthira Maharaj is doing. He is doing this samskara called jatakarma for the child Parikshet which is performed by qualified brahmanas and the vedas further say, janmana jayate shudra samskara vijam ucyate."
