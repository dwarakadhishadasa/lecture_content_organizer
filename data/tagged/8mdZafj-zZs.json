      "transcript": "But everyone should have a spiritual purpose because we must understand our composition in our present situation. This is the first teaching of the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna teaches that we must understand that there is a body and there is a spirit soul residing in the body. The spirit soul is distinct and different from the body. That is why one day this body can have a heart attack or some other kind of a big disease, and finally I will die. When I die, my body will be lying there. The body that everybody was relating with will be lying there. But then people will say, \"Oh, he is gone.\" Who has gone? What has gone? The spirit has gone. So, there is a dual situation here. There is the body and there is the spirit soul. Because of the presence of the spirit soul, the body is animated. I can sing, I can speak, I can do work, I can think, I can solve problems. All this I can do because of the presence of the spirit soul. When the soul leaves the body, it's a dead body. It is just carried and set on fire into ashes. Nothing more can be done with it when the soul has left the body. But the soul, Krishna teaches, is eternal: na jayate namriyate vā kadācin na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre."

We only have goals and purposes and aspirations connected with the body, and my things connected, relations with the body. So, spirituality is about understanding and exploring our spiritual potential, our spiritual aspect of life. And everyone is supposed to do this."

      "transcript": "And when you have spiritual purpose, one may think that what will happen to my profession? No. That can also go on. Profession can go on and our spiritual progress also can go on. We can run our lives on multiple tracks. All people do that. People run, they have their professional life, they have their personal life, and they have some hobbies, some music, something they'll be practicing, cultivating. They have that and another track. So, life runs on multiple tracks. And we must have one track called spiritual development track. And we may do many other things: our professional life, personal life. Along with this, we should fire another track in our lives called the spiritual understanding and spiritual development track. And in this way, we can bring in a spiritual purpose to our lives. Not just the professional purpose, personal purpose, and some hobbies and such things."
