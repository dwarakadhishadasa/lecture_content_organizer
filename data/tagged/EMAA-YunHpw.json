      "transcript": "So today is a very significant day in the lives of the devotees who are taking Diksha initiation. When we are taking initiation from Srila Prabhupada, we are accepting Srila Prabhupada as our Diksha Guru, initiating spiritual master, and Prabhupada is also accepting you as his disciple. It is important to understand what Diksha is, what is initiation. In the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalila, Chapter 4, Chapter 24, verse 333, purport, Srila Prabhupada says that, as far as Diksha is concerned, initiation is concerned, one must refer to the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalila, Chapter 15, verse 108. So in that purport to verse 108 of Chapter 15 of the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Madhyalila, Srila Prabhupada elaborately explains about Diksha or initiation."

      "transcript": "So all of you who are taking Diksha today, you have already received divya jnana in your heart to some extent. The day you came in touch with devotees and somebody gave you a book of Prabhupada and you started reading Prabhupada's books, divya jnana started revealing within your hearts, isn't it? So the process of divya jnana, of Diksha started the day when you started hearing from Srila Prabhupada. And when you started hearing from Srila Prabhupada and you decided to follow his instructions, you might have begun with chanting Hare Krishna Maha Mantra a few times, one mala, then slowly, slowly when you read, you increase your number of malas, then you come to four malas, you are still reading Prabhupada's books, so many things you are understanding. In the beginning, you may not have the understanding that Krishna is Supreme Personality of Godhead, but anyway, I am told to chant Hare Krishna, I am chanting. Some mantra, we chant like that. But as we go on reading Prabhupada's books, we understand, oh yes, Krishna is Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krishna is not like other devatas. So divya jnana has started getting revealed within the heart. And also you understand, I am not the body, I am a spirit soul, I am Atma, I am not the Deha. Divya jnana is getting revealed within the heart. And slowly what happens, you go on reading Prabhupada's books, you keep chanting, by the time you come to chant four rounds, you feel like giving up coffee and tea. And then continue reading Prabhupada's books, continue chanting, by the time you come to eight rounds, onion and garlic goes out of your life. And then slowly, slowly, you come to the stage of chanting sixteen rounds, you start wearing Kanti Mala, you start wearing Tilak, you start fasting for Ekadashi and other festival days."

      "transcript": "Before coming in touch with Prabhupada and Prabhupada's instructions, some of us might have been fasting, but many of us would not have fasted in our life. I, for that matter, never fasted in my life. Whole life, whenever I wanted to eat anything, I was eating. But then after reading Prabhupada's books, I realized, no, we have to fast. So, first time I fasted on Gaurapurnima day. And I didn't realize, I didn't know what is fasting. Fasting karna hai, fasting karo. By that time, it was afternoon, my stomach was growling. And by evening, I was like, you know, I am going to fall dead now. And I was working in office. Then I had to leave the office. Somehow, I drove the scooter all the way to the temple. I don't know how I drove. And then when I reached the temple, Abhishekam, all those things happened. And then finally reached the Prasadam hall, sat down with great, ah, now relief. Now I am going to eat Prasadam. Half my life is already gone by that time. And I am sitting in front of the plate, waiting when will Prasadam come and fall in the plate. Suddenly, one devotee comes and tells me, what are you sitting there for? Get up, come and serve. Another 25% of my life went out. Serve ah, what? Serve. Anyway, he is calling, I could not say no. I got up and served somehow. And then finally, he sat and had Prasadam. And I was like, oh my God. First time I was, what is this fasting? Never had, had any idea. But you see, when we, when we start following Prabhupada's instructions, we start fasting. Even though the body is demanding, body is craving, I want food, I am hungry. Body is all feeling so tired, so fatigued. No, determination has come. No, I must fast. Why? Because I am not the body. I am not given to the body's demands. So you see, Divya Jnana has started getting revealed within the heart. Meat eating goes out of the life. The coffee and tea goes out. All intoxicants go out. So, this is Kuryat Papasya Sankshayam. Papasya Sankshaya also has started happening."

      "transcript": "So why? Because, Papa or the sinful reactions in our life are of two kinds. One is the propensity to perform sinful activities which comes by our, because of our ignorance. And because of our ignorance, that thinking that I am the body, I am not a spirit soul, we have committed so many sinful activities in our past life. So we get the propensity to perform sinful activities in our current life also, which is the result of sinful activities in our past lives. And second, the way the sinful reactions manifest is in the form of suffering. So there is suffering and when we speak of suffering on account of our accumulated sinful activities, reactions in our past lives, it again manifests in two types. One is Prarabdha Karma and another is Aprarabdha Karma. Prarabdha Karma means the results which are already manifested. This body which I have got is the result of my past activities. It is Prarabdha Karma. I have got a certain mind and intelligence that is the result of Prarabdha Karma. I might be suffering from some disease that is the result of my Prarabdha Karma. That means it is already manifest. I am already, I am already either enjoying or suffering the fruit of my past activity. The second type of sinful reaction is Aprarabdha Karma. Aprarabdha Karmam Kutam Bijam Falon Mukam. This Aprarabdha Karma is of three kinds. One is, it is in seed form. Another is sprouting. Another is the fruit which is not yet ripe. So the, when the sinful reactions in our life are accumulated like a mountain, they are all like the bija, like the seeds which you have accumulated within a jar of seeds. So when you keep the seeds in the jar, they will remain as it is."

      "transcript": "Now you take out the seed and put it into the soil, put a little water, put a little manure. What will happen? After a few days, you will see it sprouting. So that is called Kuta. Bijam Kutam Falon Mukam. Kuta, bija is in the seed form. When the situations in your life become favorable for that seed to start sprouting, it will become like a, it will be, it will start sprouting. That sprouted plant is called Kuta. And then, the plant will grow. And after a little while, it will start giving fruits. That fruit, when it is still unripened, it is called Fala Unmukha. That means, the result is going to come. So just like suppose, I go and admit myself in engineering college. So I have just admitted myself in the college. That means in four years, the fruit of my admitting in the engineering college is going to come in the form of the degree. So, the moment I admit myself into the engineering college, my engineering degree is Fala Unmukha. It is going to come. And then finally, there is the ripened fruit, which is Prarabdha Karma. So, when we, when, so the spiritual master in your life until now, he has been giving you Divya Jnana. And he is also Kuryat Papasya Sankshayam. He is taking away the sinful reactions in your life by removing your propensities, to perform sinful activities. That is why you have started following the four regulated principles: no meat eating, no intoxication, no gambling, no illicit sex."

But after reading Prabhupada's books, we feel, no, I should not do that. That means the propensity was there in you, but that has been removed by Srila Prabhupada. So therefore, he has already given, put you on the, into the process of Diksha or initiation. So real initiation begins from the day you start hearing from the spiritual master, from Srila Prabhupada. And when you take the determination, when you are determined, when you read Prabhupada's books, you have to chant 16 malas, you have to follow the four regulated principles, you have to fast on Ekadashi, what happens? You start, you feel, yes, I should follow that. That determination actually constitutes Diksha or initiation. And what ceremony we are undergoing right now, where there is a fire sacrifice, you will receive a new spiritual name, you will receive beads chanted on by the Ritvik on behalf of Prabhupada, this is the formal part or the official part of Diksha. So somebody may say, then I can undergo real initiation, I will read Prabhupada's books, I will follow all his instructions, why do I have to undergo formal Diksha? Why do I need to undergo the ceremony? I will keep following whole my life. Prabhupada says that if you, as long as you are following Prabhupada's instructions and in your heart you have accepted Prabhupada as your spiritual master, as your Diksha Guru, you are as good as his disciple, but you are not yet his disciple."

When you are sitting in the formal ceremony, what are you committing? You are committing that, I am going to accept Prabhupada as my Diksha Guru, life after life, eternally. Eternally, Prabhupada is my only sole Diksha Guru. This is the commitment you are making from your side. There is no going back from here. There is no point of no return. You cannot go back tomorrow and say that, no, I made a mistake, I want to take Diksha from someone else. No. Not in this life, not in a hundred life henceforth, not even after you go back to the spiritual world. Now from this point onwards, once you have taken formal official Diksha, even when you go to the spiritual world, there also Srila Prabhupada will be guiding you as your Diksha Guru. That is the meaning of eternally you are accepting him as your Diksha Guru. And from Prabhupada's side, he is acting as your Diksha Guru. What he does, the moment you are sitting for this formal Diksha, Prabhupada says, when you take the first initiation, Prabhupada takes away all your sinful reactions. How does Prabhupada take away all your sinful reactions? Already he has taken away all your propensity to perform sinful activities. No. Kuryat Papasanksham has already done to one extent. But all your accumulated sinful reactions in all the past lives, aprarabdha karma, sitting as Bija, Kuta, Phalamukha, where will that go? And your prarabdha karma, you have got a body and a mind and intelligence, where will that go? That also has to go, when you take formal initiation from Prabhupada, at that time, Prabhupada will take away all the prarabdha and aprarabdha karma also. Not only the propensity to perform sinful activity, Prabhupada will also take away all your accumulated sinful reactions."

You become liable to be punished if you commit sinful activity again. See, until you undergo formal initiation, until you undergo formal diksha from Prabhupada, suppose you followed all the four regulative principles, you were chanting sixteen malas for one year, after that, somehow, you fell down. You gave up. You started, you stopped following the four regulative principles, you stopped chanting sixteen malas. What will happen? Whatever you have done for that one year is to your eternal credit. You will get some sukruti. That's all. And loss of karma will take over. Whatever activity, punya karma, papa karma you do, go on. That much only will happen. You will get an eternal credit. You will get sukruti for whatever you have followed. But once you take formal diksha, after that, if you don't chant your rounds or you break the regulative principles, what happens? You are liable to be punished. If you don't follow, if you break, you will be punished by your diksha guru, Prabhupada and by Krishna. Until that point of time, no punishment. You are only getting sukruti. You are only getting blessing. Now blessing will be hitting also. If you disobey, if you break your vow, because in a formal ceremony what you are doing, you are sitting in front of Agni, you are sitting in front of all Vaishnavas, you are sitting in front of the Deity, and you are taking a vow that you will follow Prabhupada's instructions without fail."

Until now you are chanting the holy name. Okay, no problem. The holy name was acting in your life. But now, the holy name is officially getting delivered to you from the parampara. Therefore, the holy name will act more powerfully in your life. Now, from now on when you chant Hare Krishna Mantra, that holy name will have a much more powerful effect in purifying you and taking you back to Godhead. Second thing is, that when the Rithvik has chanted on the beads and that bead is given to you, what actually it creates is, it creates an eternal bind between you and Prabhupada, as Prabhupada is your spiritual master and you as his disciple. This is the significance of the Rithvik chanting on the beads on behalf of Prabhupada and giving it to you. And as a… Now that all your prarabdha and aprarabdha karma is taken away from you, you are actually getting a new birth. You may not feel it. You may think, I am feeling the same. It is not there. It is not a matter of feeling. It is a matter of consciousness. Because you have to understand, until now, before we took initiation from Prabhupada, our consciousness was different. What was that? Sense gratification is the goal of my life. Now, when you are taking diksha from Prabhupada, what is your consciousness? Your life and substance is Prabhupada's vani, Prabhupada's instructions. Whatever Prabhupada has ordered, that is my life. And just like life cannot be separated from the body and if the life is separated from the body, then the body becomes useless. It becomes a dead body. Like that, my soul existence, I exist now only for carrying out Prabhupada's instructions because he is my diksha guru now. So my Guru Maharaj, Prabhupada's instructions are my life and soul now. For me, material sense gratification doesn't matter, material name, fame, wealth, these things are immaterial for me now. For me, what is now soul thing in my life is carrying out the instructions of my spiritual master, my Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada. So your consciousness has changed, you see. Your consciousness has gone from material consciousness to spiritual consciousness."

That's because your material subtle body which you have got because of your prarabdha karma is now removed and you are given a new spiritual body. You are given a brahmana body. Actually you are given a brahmana body now. So you are able to think like a brahmana because now you think in terms of shastra, right? You see, when you have a, when there is a in sanatana dharma when there is a shudra, vaishya, kshatriya they all think in terms of the body. They think in terms of sense gratification. They think in terms of fame. Shudra, simply sense gratification. Vaishya is more into hoarding money. He is interested in wealth. Kshatriya is interested in name and fame. So all revolving around the body. What does brahmana think? Brahmana's thinking, his consciousness is I have to attain moksha. I have to attain liberation. I have to know who that brahman is. So his thinking is on the spiritual platform. So now you are also thinking like that. What is your thinking? Your thinking now is my goal in life is I have to go back to Godhead. So this is how a brahmana thinks. A brahmana is not interested in sense gratification. Brahmana is not interested in doing any sinful activity. He very rigidly follows the shastra. For him, shastra is the most important. Vani of his guru is most important."

Prabhupada is also taking your praarabdha karma away. Because externally, the gross body that we have got, that's not the real thing. The real thing is the subtle body. How the subtle body works. So the subtle body has been your current subtle body. In Kali Yuga, everyone is born as Shudra. Even if somebody is born in a brahmana family, he is also a Shudra only. Kalau Shudra Sambhava. So you were born in Kali Yuga with a Shudra body. Now Prabhupada has taken that away and given you a subtle brahmana body. So this is your second birth. And so therefore, to signify the second birth, you are given a spiritual name. You are given a new name. You got this praarabdha karma of this body, with its subtle body, gross and subtle body, by taking birth from your mother and father. So you got a name from them. Now, Prabhupada is giving you a new birth by taking away all your past praarabdha and aprarabdha karma. And so therefore, you are getting a new spiritual name. So this is a second birth for all of you who are taking initiation. And Prabhupada says that this formal initiation ceremony is like, it is like getting, filling up the admission form when you go to school or college. So when you go to school or college, you fill in an admission form."

If you are really a student, you should go and sit in the classes. You have to be attentive to the classes. You should be absorbing the lessons. You should be learning. That mood of yours, that determination of yours, I have come to the college to learn, not to bunk and go out and party with my friends. That's not my goal. I have come to the college, I have filled in the admission because I want to sit and learn something. Then you are a real student. Similarly, formal initiation also, it is a formality. It is like getting admitted into the college. Now, don't bunk. Right? Don't bunk and go and party with friends. You should follow all the rules and regulations. You should follow the instructions of the spiritual master. Order of Guru Maharaj, Srila Prabhupada is your life and soul now. Alright? So, whatever Prabhupada has ordered, you have to follow that implicitly. No question. No question. There is no question of asking. Until now, you could have asked. Prabhupada says this. So, let me find out whether it is asked for Shastra or not. Until now, you could have asked that question. From now onwards, you cannot ask that question. Prabhupada's order, end of it. You cannot ask for Shastric evidence and all that. Where is Shastric evidence for Prabhupada's order? Where is tradition in Prabhupada's order? Now, you cannot ask that question. Prabhupada's order is your life and substance. Shastra, tradition, your understanding, not understanding, all your logic, your arguments, you want to understand how it is correct, incorrect, all that is secondary. Whether you understand or not, whether you are going to be delivered or not, are you going back to Godhead or not, all those considerations are thrown out of the window. No more consideration. Your only consideration now is, I have to follow Prabhupada's orders in my life. Period. This is the meaning of Diksha."

Otherwise, if you get, if you sit in the formal Diksha ceremony, got initiated, after initiation, if you say, Prabhupada is saying like this, but Shastra is saying something else, science is saying something else, who knows whether it is right or not, then, you are only filled in the admission form, but you are bunking the classes. So, you are not, you are not really eligible to sit in the exam to go back to Godhead. You understand? So, therefore, you have, you have to understand the significance of formal Diksha. It involves many things. It involves your commitment to Prabhupada and Prabhupada's commitment to you to take you back to Godhead, provided you fulfill all the conditions from your side. It is a two-way contract, eternally binding you to Prabhupada. So, remain determined to follow Prabhupada's warning, Prabhupada's instructions, Prabhupada's orders and that is your life and soul from this point onwards and Prabhupada is your whole, you know, is your soul Diksha Guru, life after life and you will definitely progress on the path back to Godhead. You don't have to worry about going back to Godhead, whether I will go back to Godhead or not. None of those considerations have to be there. Simply, right now, from now on, your only thinking and duty is, how to execute the orders of Srila Prabhupada. That's all. How to purify you, when to take you back to Godhead, how many lifetimes after which to take you back to Godhead, will I take three lifetimes like Jaya and Vijaya or will I take two lifetimes like Bharat Maharaj or will I go back within six months like Dhruva Maharaj, you don't have to consider all that. Your own, no matter, even if I have to take one thousand lifetimes or one million lifetimes again and again, I have to take birth within the material world, no problem. Even in every single of those million lifetimes also, I'll keep following Prabhupada's instructions, my Guru Maharaj's instructions. This should be your determination. This is the, this is what really makes you a disciple and this is what pleases Prabhupada as your Diksha Guru. This attitude of a devotee, unquestioning loyalty, this unquestioning paraabhakti towards Guru, is what pleases Guru. And if Prabhupada, your Diksha Guru, is pleased with this, yasya prasadad bhagavad prasadad, then Krishna will be pleased with you. And if Krishna is pleased with you, your going back to Godhead is not an issue at all. Comfortably, without your putting any endeavor."
