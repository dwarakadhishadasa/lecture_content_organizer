      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/xOQ_PT_-FRw?t=144",
      "transcript": "In these words, Anuja means the younger brother. So the strong words of Vidura had a very nice impact on the heart of Dhritarashtra. He was able to cut off all the strong familial ties and he became determined. He immediately left home. Vidura was not delivered. collect вжеi ki Bopamanna Varasi Tal. Immediately left home. And that is the wonderful effect of the association of a pure devotee Vidura. So, Srila Prabhupada says in the purport, Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the great preacher of the principles of Srimad Bhagavatam, has stressed the importance of association with sadhus or pure devotees of the Lord. This is explained in the Bhagavad Gita. Sadhu means a pure devotee, not one with a long beard or one with a particular type of tilak or talak, or one with a particular type of robes. No, this is not sadhu. Sadhu means a pure devotee. So, sadhu is bhajate mam ananyabhak, one who is engaged in pure devotional service without even a little deviation. So, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has said that even a moment's association with a pure devotee can help one achieve all perfection. What is the verse Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says? Sadhu Sangha Sadhu Sangha Sarva Shastra Koi. Lava Matra Sadhu Sanghe Sarva Siddhi Hoi. The meaning of this verse in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, this is said by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu: The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that, by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that, by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. Lava Matra. Lava is just one moment. Actually, Shri Lapa Prabhupada says, this Lava Matra Sadhu Sangha, a brief moment. What is the duration of that brief moment? According to astronomical calculation, Lava means one eleventh of a second. Lava means one eleventh of a second. It is less than one second. It is one eleventh of a second. So, so little association is very, very valuable. So, so little association is very, very valuable."

      "transcript": "There is one more verse in the Bhagavatam. It is said... tulayama lave naapi na svaryam na punar bhavam... tulayama lave naapi na svaryam na punar bhavam... Bhagavat Sanghi Sanghasya... Bhagavat Sanghi Sanghasya... martyanaam kim utashishah... lava also the same duration of time is being used. The meaning of this Bhagavatam verse is: the value of a moment's association with a devotee of the Lord cannot be compared even to the attainment of heavenly planets or liberation from matter, and what to speak of worldly benedictions in the form of material prosperity which is for those who are meant for death. So it's very, very, very, very valuable to have even a brief association with a pure devotee of the supreme law, that is the teaching of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So Srila Prabhupada says about his own life in this purport, he says, we are not ashamed to admit this fact, that we experienced this particular teaching of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in our practical life. Srila Prabhupada experienced this. Were we not favoured by His Divine Grace, Sri Madbhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, by our first meeting for a few minutes only, it would not have been possible for us to accept this mighty task of describing Sri Madbhagavatam in English. Srila Prabhupada, while writing this purport, in the first canto, he is recollecting his first meeting with his spiritual master, Sri Srimadbhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj. Without seeing him at that opportune moment, he said, we could have become a very great business magnate, but never would we have been able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual service of the Lord under the instructions of His Divine Grace, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur. So that meeting was a turning point in the life of Srila Prabhupada. Completely everything changed."

      "transcript": "Though, we should not disregard the fact that Srila Prabhupada was born to a pure devotee. His father was a pure devotee, Gaur Mohan Dey. He was a pure devotee. And Prabhupada was trained in devotional service right from his infancy by his father. That is explained in Prabhupada's biography. But nevertheless, what is the example? Here is another practical example by the action of Vidura's association with Dhritarashtra. What is the effect of Vidura coming to the palace and instructing Dhritarashtra? He just spoke some words, but those words pierced the heart of Dhritarashtra and made such an impact that Dhritarashtra was able to cut off all material attachments and immediately leave home and proceed towards the north for self-realization. So, it is also told that a sadhu's words are meant for cutting off the material bonds of attachment. And it is also told in the Shastra that a sadhu should not flatter. How sadhu? A sadhu should not flatter householders or people who are attached simply for the sake of getting some dakshina or some viksha. No. For maintaining himself, a sadhu is fully dependent on Krishna and he is confident that Krishna will protect him under all circumstances and provide him with the basic needs. So, why does a sadhu go begging? It is an excuse to enter a householder's garden in order to enlighten the householder, like Vidura is doing."

      "transcript": "So, Dhritarashtra was tightly bound in a network of material affinities related to politics, economy and family attachment. And Dhritarashtra, he did everything in his power to achieve so-called success in his planned projects, because he could not lay a claim for ascending the throne, even though he was the eldest son of his father. He could not ascend the throne because he was blind by birth. But, he had the desire and when his younger brother Pandu, after ascending the throne, died untimely, immediately Dhritarashtra got the opportunity to sit on the throne, at least as a caretaker king. Nobody else was there. So, he was the caretaker king. Then, he started planning how I can retain this throne for myself and my eldest son, Duryodhana. So, he made so many plans. But, he was frustrated from the beginning to the end, so far as his material activities were concerned. He could not continue. But, when he was still on the throne, he lost the post of the emperor when, in the battle of Kurukshetra, all his sons were defeated and killed in the battle. And he himself completely lost everything. All his well-wishers and his position and his sons and his wealth, everything he lost. And yet, despite his life of failure, materially speaking, it was a life of failure, he achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by the forceful instructions of a pure devotee of the Lord, who is the typical emblem of a sadhu. A pure devotee of the Lord. A pure devotee of the Lord. A pure devotee is a true sadhu. He is a true saintly person. His words can penetrate the heart through the layers of ignorance and instantly cleanse the heart."

      "transcript": "That's why as a sadhu, he goes door to door and speaks. In the Bhagavatam also, it is said, Shukadeva Goswami, Suta Goswami, glorified Shukadeva Goswami, that Shukadeva Goswami, out of compassion for the suffering humanity, spoke the Bhagavatam. Karunaya aha purana guhyam. Samsarinam karunaya aha purana guhyam. Out of compassion for the suffering souls of this world, Shukadeva Goswami spoke the Bhagavatam. So, same thing. Vidura spoke the words of enlightenment and Dhritarashtra became completely detached and left home and middle. The scriptures enjoin, therefore, that one should associate with sadhus only, rejecting all other kinds of association. Asasangatyagye Vaishnavachar. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says, reject association of materialistic persons, even though in their association, somebody may enjoy some material, sense gratification. But that's not important. That's available in all species of life. Even to those in hell, sense gratification is available. What to speak of others? So, that's not important. What is important is the association of sadhus or pure devotees, who can cut the bonds of material affection and free us from this material bondage and direct us from this bondage, and direct us for self-realization. This material world is a world of great illusion, and only by such association of pure devotees or genuine saints can we actually cut off our attachments, by hearing them attentively and by taking their words very seriously, understanding them to be the best well-wishers and taking their words seriously and cutting off this bondage and following their instructions how to proceed on the path of self-realization. I'll stop here. Thank you very much."
