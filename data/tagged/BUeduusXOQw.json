      "transcript": "In this session we will be discussing from the 21st and 22nd verses of the 7th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. So the 21st verse, ततप् प्रादुष्कृतं तेजः प्रचंडं सर्वतोधिषं प्राणापदं अभिप्रेक्ष विष्णुम् जिष्णुर् वाचः। The meaning of these words, विष्णुम् जिष्णुर् वाचः। विष्णु is Lord Krishna, जिष्णु is Arjuna. So Arjuna began to address Krishna upon seeing that glaring light spreading in all directions and he thought his own life is in danger. The next words, the 22nd words, अर्जुन वाचः। What did Arjuna tell Krishna? कृष्ण कृष्ण महाबाहो भक्तानाम् अभयन्दुष्कृष्ण। त्वमेको दह्यमानाम् अपवर्गोशि संसृतेः। The meaning of these 22nd words. अर्जुन वाचः। Arjuna said, ओ मैं लोड श्री कृष्ण। कृष्ण कृष्ण महाबाहो। यु अर्जुन वाचः। तुम्हे को दह्यमानाम् अपवर्गोषि संसृतेः। Therefore, only you are competent to instill fearlessness in the hearts of your devotees. Everyone in the flames of material miseries can find the path of liberation in you only."

      "transcript": "So, by Arjuna's statement, we can understand what is the position of a devotee. Only a devotee is fearless in this material world. All others who are not devotees, who are not devotees of Krishna, they are always in a situation where any time there can be fearlessness. There is no cause for fear of some danger, due to some danger, material danger. And Krishna is the unlimited Supreme Lord. Therefore, only Krishna can give complete protection to anyone who takes shelter of him. But who takes shelter of Krishna, it's only his devotees. Non-devotees, they may think that they are safe, or they have some different arrangements for their safety, for their protection. But actually, in this material world, there are four characteristics of material existence. There are four characteristics of material existence: Ahara, Nidra, Bhaya, Maithunam, Jaa. Everyone is in need of food for their subsistence. Ahara, Nidra, they are required to take some rest, sleep. And Bhaya, there is always fear due to some danger, one form or the other. So many different kinds of dangers are there in this world. And Maithunam, the demand for sex, sex indulgence."

      "transcript": "So, these four things are common for all living beings who have taken birth in this material world under the laws of karma. So, that fear factor is always there. But Krishna is Bhaktanam Abhayankara. He is the giver of fearlessness. He awards fearlessness to whom? To those who take his shelter, his devotees. Everyone in the flames of material miseries can find the path of liberation in you only. So, Shrida Prabhupada explains, Arjuna was aware of the transcendental qualities of Lord Sri Krishna as he had already experienced them during the Kurukshetra war in which both of them were present. Even though Krishna was not fighting in that battle, he agreed to become Arjuna's chariot driver, to guide Arjuna. And the Pandavas, of course. Not just Arjuna alone, all the Pandavas."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/BUeduusXOQw?t=374",
      "transcript": "So, Arjuna had already experienced how in spite of big, big generals on the opposite side. This is very nicely described by Shankaracharya. He says, Bhishma Drona, Tata Jayadrata Jala, Gandhara Neelotpala, Shalya Grahavati, Kripenavahini, Karnena Velakula, Ashwathama Vikarana Ghoramakara, Duryodhana Avarthini, Soktirna Kalu Pandavai Rananadi, Kaivartaka Keshavaha. The Pandavas, in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, they did not have much strength, military strength as compared to the Kauravas. Of course, Bhima and Arjuna were very, very, very powerful fighters. They were maharathis. But on the opposite side, on the Kaurava side, there were so many maharathis. And among them, Bhishma and Drona, the topmost. Among all those present at that time, the topmost maharathis were on Kaurava's side, Bhishma and Drona. And not only that, Karna and Ashwathama, Vikarna, Duryodhana. So, in this verse, it is listed all these great fighters. Maharathis, chariot fighters, single-handed, they could face thousands of other warriors. They could kill in a combat, military combat. So, in spite of so much of strength on the Kaurava side, because the Pandavas had Krishna as their guide, they were able to cross this most dangerous ocean. Shankaracharya compares the battlefield to an ocean. And the Pandavas, they had to cross this dangerous ocean full of all kinds of sharks, all kinds of whirlpools, all kinds of crocodiles. Imagine, a person has to cross a water body, which is like an ocean. The vastness of the army strength of the Kauravas. In spite of that, because Krishna was their guide. Therefore, they crossed without being vanquished by the Kaurava army."

Krishna is almighty and is especially the cause of fearlessness for the devotees. Krishna is the cause of all fearlessness for the devotees. A devotee of the Lord is always fearless. There's another song written by Govinda Das Thakur. He says, my dear mind, always sing the glories of the Supreme Lord Krishna. Nanda Nandana. Krishna has got many names of which this name Nanda Nandana, the beloved son of Maharaj Nanda. Shri Nanda Nandana, Abhaya Charanaravindare. Because, his lotus feet is the cause of fearlessness. One who takes shelter of Krishna's lotus feet can be fearless in this material world. So, here Prabhupada says, a devotee of the Lord is always fearless because of the protection given by the Lord."

      "transcript": "Material existence is something like a blazing fire in the forest. What does Arjuna say here? That, Tvam eko dahyamananam. Material world is sometimes compared to a forest fire. Supposing somebody is in the middle of a forest. And suddenly, there is a forest fire. And that fire spreads very, very, very quickly because, especially if it is summer, and the wood is dry, the trees, it will spread very quickly. And what if a person is caught up in the middle of a forest fire? Every direction he sees, he sees a blazing fire. So, is there a possibility he can escape? Yes, only one possibility. Only if there is a big rainfall which pours down heavily from the sky and then extinguishes this forest fire. See, it is not easy to extinguish a forest fire. Only a huge rainfall from a dense rain cloud which pours down completely extinguishes the forest fire. Then a person is safe. So, Krishna alone can extinguish this forest fire of material existence. Only Krishna can extinguish."

Material existence is like filled with so many miseries. That is the nature of material existence. Therefore, it is also said, manashashtanindriyani prakrutisthani karshati In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says living entities are simply engaged in a struggle for existence. So, that struggle for existence can be put to an end immediately if we take shelter of lotus feet of Krishna, who can actually shower. Or the lotus feet of Krishna's representative, the bona fide spiritual master, the pure devotee spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada. Take shelter of Prabhupada's lotus feet. Vande gro Sri Charanaravindam. So, we take shelter. Take shelter of Prabhupada's lotus feet. Then Prabhupada also can bring down the shower of mercy of Krishna, because he is always in touch with Krishna. So, he can bring down the mercy rainfall, which will extinguish this blazing fire of material existence."

Actually, this was the Brahmastra that was released by Ashwatthama to protect himself. But Arjuna did not know that, that the cause of that radiation suddenly he saw is spreading everywhere. And his own life in danger. He did not know what is the cause. So, he is addressing Krishna. Only you can protect me. You can save my life. Where is this? He is going to ask him the next words while addressing Krishna. Where is this radiation coming from? My dear Lord, I do not know. Please, can you tell me? And of course, Arjuna has taken shelter of Krishna completely as a devotee. But we should also learn how to take shelter of Krishna and thereby be saved from the dangers of material existence. I will stop here. Thank you very much."
