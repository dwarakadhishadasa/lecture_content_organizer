So, through these senses and our mind also, if you are able to perceive, we can see forms through these eyes, we can hear sounds through these ears, we can smell different fragrances through the nose, we can perceive subtle things through the mind or even the intelligence we can perceive, but that is not knowledge. That is not knowledge. Merely perceiving a form doesn't mean you know what that is. It's like I am seeing your form, and even if I understand what this form is, but I am thinking I am seeing you, but actually I am not seeing you. I am seeing your external covering. You are within that form called the body. Even if I perceive your mind, still I am not perceiving you. I am perceiving your mind, different from you, different from me. Even if I perceive your intelligence, I am able to, you know, figure out something about your intelligence, oh, you are an intelligent person, you are learned in such and such a subject or whatever, you are a mature adult, but still that is not you. Those are all the characteristics of your subtle body called intelligence, mind, intelligence, ego, body. So the body is different, the body is different, the person is different, but not in the case of Krishna. Krishna has appeared in the specific form, 400 form, Narayana form, but that is not the external form of Krishna. No, Krishna is nothing external and internal. Shukadeva Gosvami describing Mother Yashoda is trying to catch Krishna and Krishna is running away after stealing butter, not stealing, after breaking a butter pot and taking the butter. So then Mother Yashoda has become very angry against Krishna, why is he spoiling the..."

She's taken a stick actually to punish him by beating him, but then seeing his fear on his face, she said, I cannot punish this child, small child, but some mischief it is doing. No, no, she threw away the stick then, but still she was thinking where to stop his, I have to stop his naughty activities. So I have to bind him and now I have to punish him some way, so let me just tie him. Let me just tie him, but at least he will stop for the time being, he'll stop his naughty activities. So she decided to tie him to that grinding mortar and then she brought rope and then she's trying to tie him with some rope and the rope is not sufficient. Why? Why is that rope not sufficient? Shukadeva Goswami explains that Krishna, Supreme Lord, has no inside, has no outside, is no inside, no outside. After all, when she's trying to tie him, she is trying to tie him external measurement of his body, right? With the grinding mortar. Grinding mortar also got an external form, certain shape, certain size. Krishna is a small boy, so together she has to bind. So first time she tried binding, the length of the rope was not enough. He bought some more rope. Now she's bringing more and more rope and it is not enough to tie him. Why?"

There is nothing there to measure. What will you measure? Where is the form to measure something? So therefore that which is within this material world made of matter that you can measure or you may try to measure it okay you can try to grasp it but Krishna's form is beyond this material world. So therefore to understand Krishna to know Krishna to see Krishna to perceive Krishna is possible only by transcendental knowledge. What is this transcendental knowledge? This is explained by Krishna himself in the Bhagavad Gita."

Now this word Prabhupada translates, note the translation of Prabhupada, it is called parampara understanding of Bhagavad Gita, what does he translate it as surrender to me? Is it not? What is the word for meaning chaturvida bhajanthema bhajanthi the translation it is surrender the translation it is surrender but in the word for meaning 7.16 okay Prabhupada's in the word for meaning is given rendered service bhaja means devotional service okay in the translation also it's notive satsang surroundosen i am a god and have monde whose and four kinds of people surrender. Of course the sense in which this bhajante is in the sense of the word prapadyate. It's in the sense of surrender. Okay, it comes in the 19th verse, prapadyate. बहुनाम जन्मनामंते ज्ञानमान्माम् प्रपद्यते Anyway, the point I want to make is that in the 19th verse, in this 16th verse, 7th chapter, Krishna says four kinds of people begin to render devotional service to Him. बजन्ते आर्त जिग्ञासु अर्थार्थी ज्ञानी Of these four categories, Krishna says ज्ञानी is the best. Why? Because he says तेशाम ज्ञानी नित्य युक्ता ज्ञानी means one who is situated in knowledge. Knowledge of what? Knowledge of the Supreme Lord. बितितोसि भवान साक्षात पुरुषह प्रकृते परहा This knowledge. Here ज्ञानी refers to one who knows कृष्णा as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And the result of knowing कृष्णा as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is तेशाम ज्ञानी नित्य युक्ता एक भक्तिर्। विशिश्यते एक भक्तिर् नित्य युक्ता He is completely devoted to worshipping कृष्णा. Always, Constantly, नित्य युक्ता एक भक्तिर्।"

Therefore, when the atheists say that these worshippers of God, especially in the form of deity, are some particular form which they think is material, and even the Mayavadis or the impersonal, they think that this form is material form and it's imaginary form because God is formless, so you cannot worship formless. So therefore, but shastra says one should worship God. So the Mayavadis think, yeah, we have to worship the impersonal Brahman, we have to worship the impersonal Brahman. That's an understanding of the absolute truth. So how do you worship impersonal Brahman? The method of worshiping the impersonal Brahman of the impersonalists is you imagine some form in the beginning, you imagine some form. Later on, when you realize God, then you forget all this imaginary form because that's not God anyway, so you forget that, you stop that. But our process of devotional service, bhakti, is not like that. Real bhakti is we worship that transcendent form of God from the beginning and even in the end, always we only worship God, real God, and that form is prakriti, that form is the form of the transcendental personality who is transcendental to this material creation and that form can be perceived only by..."

So in the beginning, even if we are not able to perceive God because we are not yet conversant with transcendental knowledge, then we are told you just chant Hare Krishna. हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे हरे राम हरे राम राम राम हरे हरे that is the way to perceive God in the beginning. These are the ways, but you also understand that actually God cannot be perceived simply by with these eyes seeing one deity form, you cannot perceive God like that because he is not having any material form. His form is not material, yet the deity is made up of what? Either wood or stone or metal. That is very much material, but the science of Krishna Consciousness helps us understand that God has appeared in a form which we can see or perceive sound form or material metal form or a form of a description in the scriptures. Here description is there. Krishna appeared in this 400 form, the description is there which we can understand, we can, we can get some idea what he looks like or what form he appeared, not in a form, but this is not a material form. This is not a ordinary form, neither the form the deity nor the sound of Hare Krishna nor the form which appeared in front of Vasudeva is a material form. It's a transcendental form. So that transcendental form is perceived only by..."

The knowledge that the Supreme Lord is the Supreme person is completely spiritual personality who is realized only by bhakti. Bhakti abhijanati abhijanati so many verses in the Bhagavad Gita they explain it is explained in the Bhagavat Gita Krishna can be seen or understood or known or worshiped only by bhakti equivocal cells. So this Transcendental knowledge also is realize or understood or obtained by devotional service and Vasudeva is actually a pure devotee. Vasudeva is a pure devotee and therefore Krishna chose to appear as his son for his Leela in this material world. He chose to appear as his son. So he is participating in Krishna Leela and part of that Leela is that Vasudeva is praying to the Lord I want to have a son like you. This is Leela. He is already a devotee. There is no need for him to ask Krishna you appear as my son or I want to have a son like you. There is no need. There is no need for a devotee to even ask because already he is he is always Nityayukta Ekabhaktyar Nityayukta Upasate he is always worshipping the Lord constantly. So therefore it is part of the Leela the birth pastime of Krishna Janma Karma Chame Divyam and as far as we are concerned we can see or we can understand or we can realize or we can perceive Krishna only through Transcendental Knowledge that is the understanding your form can be perceived by Transcendental Knowledge therefore this Transcendental Knowledge is awakened in our heart it is already there but it is awakened by the process of Sadhana Bhakti."
