      "transcript": "So Krishna's departure from this world to his personal abode in his self-same form, not change of body. This difference has to be noted. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna says, \"Death means change of body.\" Now here, Krishna is departing to his personal abode in the self-same form. He never changes his spiritual form. So eternally he is the Lord. But eternally he has his form. Eternally he has everything. He has his energies. He has his paraphernalia. He has his name. He has his qualities. He has his activities. Everything eternal. So this distinction should be understood between material name, material form, material paraphernalia, material activities, material possessions, material manifestation. Everything is temporary. Everything material is temporary. And everything spiritual is permanent, eternal, changeless. As long as Krishna was present, Kali could not manifest its actual characteristic of inauspicious conditions. But when Krishna left this earthly planet, from that very day, Kali manifested, became fully manifest. And the full manifestation means creating inauspicious conditions for those who are endowed with a poor fund of knowledge."

      "transcript": "Prabhupada explains in the purport: The influence of Kali can be enforced only upon those who are not fully developed in God consciousness. So Kali, or for that matter even the material modes of nature, cannot act upon those who are fully developed in God consciousness. Krishna says this in the Bhagavad Gita: those who are engaged in pure devotional service in an unfailing manner, they are always on the spiritual platform, Brahma Bhuyaya Kalpate Guna Tita. They are above the three modes, above the influence of the three modes. And above the influence of the three modes also means above the influence of Kali because Kali acts in the material atmosphere through the three gunas."

      "transcript": "Prabhupada says further, one can neutralize the effects of Kali by keeping oneself fully under the supreme care of the personality of Godhead. Actually, Krishna is our only protector, only maintainer, and we should take complete shelter of Krishna through the proper method. Our material method will not work because Krishna is not a material personality. This material personality is a concoction, is a creation of the illusory energy, whereas Krishna's personality is beyond all material manifestations, beyond illusion, is a sent person reality, eternal reality. So take shelter of Krishna who always does give permanent eternal protection to everyone except those who turn away from him and are in the clutches of the illusory energy, except for them."

      "transcript": "That's what Prabhupada is telling here. The age of Kali ensued just after the battle of Kurukshetra, but it could not exert its influence because of the presence of the Lord, because of the presence of Lord Krishna. The Lord, however, left this earthly planet in his own transcendental body, self-same form. That's what is said in this verse, his own transcendental body. And as soon as he left, the symptoms of Kali Yuga as were envisioned by Maharaj Yudhishthira prior to Arjuna's arrival from Dwaraka began to manifest. And Maharaj Yudhishthira rightly conjectured on the departure of the Lord from the earth even before Arjuna could come back with the actual news of the departure of Krishna from Dwaraka. Yudhishthira Maharaj, seeing the ill omens, conjectured that these ill omens are indicating Krishna's departure from this world. As we have already explained, the Lord left our sight just as when the sun sets it is out of our sight. Nothing happens to the sun when it sets, it is just disappeared from our vision, our sight."

If I were to put it in the form of lakhs, the total duration of Kali is 4,32,000, out of which 5,000, if you deduct what remains, this balance is 427,000 years. So, the symptoms of the Kali Yuga as mentioned above, namely avarice, greed (avarice means greed), falsehood, diplomacy (diplomacy means duplicitous behavior), cheating, nepotism, violence, and all such things are already involved in the Kali Yuga. And no one can imagine what is going to happen gradually with further increase of the influence of Kali till the day of annihilation. We have already come to know that the influence of the age of Kali is meant for godless so-called civilized man. They call themselves civilized, but they are not civilized. They are godless. So, therefore they are uncivilized. God conscious or godly people are always civilized, are always properly behaving, properly acting, properly situated, have all the good qualities that are to be found in..."

      "transcript": "Home, back to God. Yudhishthir is a pure devotee, so he doesn't have to actually do any preparation. He is always God conscious. So, but he wants to teach us before death comes, one must retire from active household life, or one must retire from material activities. Even if one is not a householder, even a brahmachari should retire from all material activities and prepare himself to go back home, back to God. So Yudhishthir Mahal is setting the example for us. The Pandavas are eternal companions of the Lord and therefore they are more interested in the company of the Lord than anything else. The eternal companions of the Lord always accompany the Lord in his mission in the material world. That's the meaning of eternal companions in this context. Besides that, being an ideal king, Maharaj Yudhishtira wanted to retire just to set an example for others. As soon as there is some young fellow to look after the family, then after the household affairs, one should at once retire from family life to uplift oneself to spiritual realization. One should not rot in the dark well of household life till one is dragged out by the will of yamaraj. So this is a lesson we should take from Yudhishthira Maharaj's behavior: don't remain in household life till the end of life in the body, before that quit household life."
