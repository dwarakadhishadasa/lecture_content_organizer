Because even in the knowledge that Krishna is the Supreme Absolute Truth, there is a knowledge Rasa, knowing Rasa. Apart from that, you know, His attractive nature, God is a reservoir of all love, and we are His part and parcel. So there also there is Rasa, loving Rasa. The material world, a world of karma, no freedom, bondage. We come to Krishna consciousness hoping for freedom Rasa. We get freedom from these material modes of nature."

Krishna is the controller of this material world. All these are dry for Bhaktas. It is Shanta Rasa. It is also Rasa."

Even Shanta Rasa is so wonderful for a Rasa-starved living entity in this material world. Even Sakya Rasa, even Shanta Rasa, where there is no active exchange of relationship, but there is appreciating Rasa of the greatness of the Supreme Lord, His creation. We need to understand, we need to always know that we are Rasa beings, and Krishna Consciousness is the highest Rasa. Krishna Consciousness is the path for us to experience. Our highest Rasa is also our original Rasa. In the material world, we run after this Rasa, that Rasa, so many Rasas. Actually, they are all not connected to us, but Krishna Rasa or Bhakti Rasa is our original Rasa."
