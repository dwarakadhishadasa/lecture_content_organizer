The whole environment was so powerful, and for my profession, where I only hear about disease and pain and suffering, I, for a while, was feeling completely out of any miserable situation and pain, and it was a wonderful experience. ISKCON Bangalore has not only stood strong, it has been the guiding force. I have been coming to the temple from the last 20 years, and every single day has been a new energy for me, for my profession. I thank ISKCON Bangalore for giving me this wonderful opportunity to be a part."
