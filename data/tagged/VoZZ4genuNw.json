      "key_quote": "Spiritual life means austerity, tapo divyam. And austerity means voluntarily accepting some inconvenience for a higher purpose.",
      "summary": "The speaker contrasts the mentality of personal deliverance with the desire to serve Prabhupada's mission of expanding Krishna consciousness through building temples, emphasizing that spiritual life involves accepting inconvenience for a higher purpose.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/VoZZ4genuNw?t=0",
      "transcript": "Why build this temple? So many donors, so many problems, so many escalations. There can be this mentality. There could be somebody who is interested in his own deliverance, personal deliverance. A person with that mentality, why should I break my head? Why should I be involved in this thing? Unnecessary tension, stress, anxiety. But if we execute the instructions of Prabhupada, who desired that preaching be expanded, desired that temples be built, more and more people get Krishna consciousness. Prabhupada very emphatically demonstrated by his personal example what he desired, what he wanted from his disciples. Spiritual life means austerity, tapo divyam. And austerity means voluntarily accepting some inconvenience for a higher purpose. There may be inconvenience, but we accept it for a higher cause."
