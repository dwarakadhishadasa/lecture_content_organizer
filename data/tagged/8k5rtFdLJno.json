      "transcript": "what is happening as the cause for the darkness spreading everywhere in the universe. So Brahma is describing, first of all he described Vaikuntha. And he has already described that the four Kumaras while wandering carefree, because they were liberated souls and they didn't have any definite desire. The description is there. My four sons, Sanakya, Sanatana, Sanantara and Sanat Kumara who are born from my mind are your predecessors. They are born much before all the demigods. As they travel throughout the material and spiritual skies without any definite desire. So then Brahma is describing as they travel all over the universes, they also travel in the spiritual sky. So they happen to enter the spiritual sky. And because they were freed from all material contamination, they could go there. And they also had the yogic siddhi. It requires yogic siddhi to go to specific places. Otherwise they are restricted to the planet. They are supposed to stay there. Now normally yogic siddhi means they can travel within the universe. But exceptionally advanced yogis like the four Kumaras can even cross the coverings of the universe. So elsewhere it is explained that to cross the coverings of the universe, one has to be fully free from all material contamination, fully purified, and should be a liberated soul. Only a liberated soul can cross the coverings of the universe. Even among the yogis, those yogis who are not liberated, they cannot go beyond the coverings of the universe. They cannot go. So from this description it is very clear that the four Kumaras were liberated souls. And they were liberated souls who were also yogis. Because they were yogis, they could travel freely. If one is not a yogi, one cannot travel. So they were liberated souls. Therefore they could cross the coverings of the universe and they could reach the Vaikuntha planet because they were yogis, yogis and liberated souls. So then Brahma gives the elaborate description of Vaikuntha that we have been hearing in the past several verses. We have been hearing about the Vaikuntha."

      "transcript": "So, without any definite desire, Prabhupada explains, means no material desires. No material desires. So to become free from material desire is possible only if one is free from all types of material contamination. Even if there is a small tinge of material contamination, there is material desire. So many times people wonder what is this material contamination? It is nothing but material desire. Whenever it is referred to, material contamination in the heart or consciousness. Consciousness is completely spiritual. So how can consciousness be contaminated? It is the desire which becomes contaminated. Naturally, as spirit souls, it is the desire which becomes contaminated. Because we all have consciousness. That consciousness is the symptom of spirit, symptom of spirit soul, consciousness. The characteristic of consciousness is desire. Consciousness means desire. So a living being cannot be without desire. Therefore, many times Prabhupada explains, if it is said, one has to become desireless, it means that one has to become free from material desires. That's the meaning, desireless. Nispruhaha, many places in the Bhagavad Gita, nispruhaha, nispruhasarvakamebhyo, free from all kinds of material desires. So people who don't know about devotional service or bhakti yoga, they think desirelessness means no desire, become a stone, become like a stone, no material desire, no activity. That is not correct. So they try to become desireless. That is not correct. They try to become desireless, try to become inactive. But that is never possible for a living being, never possible. So without any definite desire means without any material desire. So without any material desire means there is spiritual desire. There are spiritual desires. So the kumaras are travelling with a spiritual desire."

      "transcript": "At least one spiritual desire, there could be more. It is the characteristic of the living being to be always having desires, always having. That's a characteristic. That is the natural symptom of living. It is like this table. Can it have any desire? Material object, can it have desire? Material substance. Is there anything like that? No. Is there anything like desire? No. So that is characteristic of spirit, soul, desire, consciousness, activity, senses, perception, thinking, feeling, willing, all these are characteristics of spirit, living person. So if we understand this very carefully, it's not difficult to understand the supreme absolute truth or the supreme spirit is also full of desires. Because desire is the characteristic of spirit. He has senses. He has thinking, feeling, willing. He has senses. He has thinking, feeling, willing. He has senses. He has perception. He has feelings. He has intelligence. He has activities. He has qualities, spiritual qualities. See, the whole understanding is completely different if you properly understand what is the spirit. He is the ultimate, the ultimate emotions. He is the ultimate power. He is the ultimate consciousness. So these Mayavadi philosophers, they study so much the Vedas and after all that the conclusion, because they are stuck up with one philosophy, absolute truth is impersonal, that's why they come to a wrong conclusion. Either living being or absolute truth, no desires at all, no senses, no activity and to justify that, they say see scriptures describe absolute truth as nirguna, nirvikara, nirvishesha. But unless they hear the meaning, the explanation of all these descriptions in the scriptures from a proper source, they will not understand. They take the literal meaning. Nirguna means without qualities. Nirguna means without material qualities."

This material world, 15th chapter of Bhagavad Gita is described by Krishna as an inverted reflection of the spiritual world, so in the spiritual world, unless there is variety, how can there be a difference? How can there be variety in the material world? But Krishna also explains in the 15th chapter, it's a perverted reflection. Literally, if you take, urdha-moolam-adashakam, inverted reflection, just like this. Just like if you want to see inverted reflection in the mirror, if you are standing on your feet, in the mirror it will appear like you're standing on your head, shirsasana, what is that? Shirsasana. So it's not exactly inverted reflection. See this also requires an acharya to explain, what is this urdha-moolam-adashakam? It's a perverted reflection. There's a difference between perverted reflection and inverted reflection. Perverted reflection is, it's like, to give an example of perverted reflection, if you look in a convex mirror or a concave mirror, your face, let us say, your face will appear either very big or very small. Correct? Have you seen that? Sometimes you would have seen, some of you would have seen at least. So like that, in this material world, even though it's a reflection of the spiritual world, it is not a proper reflection. It's a perverted reflection."

So material quality and spiritual quality, very clearly Krishna has distinguished in the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, by distinguishing the soul from the body or spirit from matter. Very clearly Krishna has given the distinction. In other places in the scriptures also, many, many, many, many places it is there. The descriptions are there. Matter and spirit, very clearly it is there. So perverted reflection means of the material quality as opposed to spiritual quality in the spiritual world. So Prabhupada explains, since there is variety here, and because the material world is a reflection of the spiritual world, there is variety in the spiritual world. But because this reflection is a perverted reflection, we should not think just like there is material variety here, there is material variety in the spiritual world. No. There is spiritual variety. So the nature of spirit, to properly understand, you have to study the scriptures under proper guidance. Otherwise all kinds of interpretation or misinformation, just like these mayavadis, there are so many wrong understandings."

      "transcript": "So it is described that the Kumaras, they had desire, they were eager to see the Lord. They were eager to see the Lord in Vaikuntha. They had already seen the Lord in the heart. In perfection. In perfect Samadhi, a yogi is able to see the form of the Lord in the heart, Paramatma form, Supersoul. But if a yogi is not having proper knowledge about who or what is that form in the heart of the Supersoul, Paramatma, then their conclusion will be, what is that form in the heart? Their conclusion will be, oh, this is the manifestation of the impersonal Brahman, the absolute truth or God. This Paramatma feature is a manifestation of the impersonal Brahman. Similarly, they also conclude that we are not the body. We are spirit soul. We are eternal. We are spiritual by nature. So they conclude that this spiritual nature or spirit soul is also manifestation of impersonal Brahman. Now again, some places in the scriptures, there is description. Absolute truth is Brahman. We are also Brahman. And the qualities of Brahman are given, identical. Nirvikara, nirguna, nirvishesha, nirvikalpa. Whether you apply that to the soul or the Supersoul or the impersonal Brahman, the absolute truth, same qualities. So they equalize the soul with the impersonal Brahman."

In the spiritual world, there also there are millions of living beings. But they are having spiritual form, they are having spiritual desires, they have spiritual activity, they have spiritual senses, their intelligence is spiritual. Their identity is spiritual. Do you understand? You see, how perfect, clear understanding can be there, only when you hear from the perfect source. That's why the perfect source is described in the Bhagavad Gita and all the important scriptures, that you have to hear in the parampara system, from a guru who is coming in parampara, beginning from Krishna. This modern day follows Shankaracharya, we are also in parampara. Which parampara? Shankaracharya parampara. If you ask the question, Shankaracharya parampara, does it begin from Krishna? No."

Yes. So here, in the Bhagavatam, there is a direct and clear description. In some places in the scriptures, the description is not very direct. It is indirect. Now, somebody will say, why indirect description? Why not direct description? Because there are foolish people, who will mistake these descriptions in the Bhagavatam, in the Bhagavata, to be descriptions of something material. So first of all, before anybody touches Bhagavatam, descriptions of the personal features of the Absolute Truth, they should understand the impersonal feature, if there is a possibility that they'll misunderstand the personal descriptions. But we don't have that problem. As devotees who are hearing the descriptions of the personal features from the pure devotee spiritual world, we have no problem, because when Prabhupada describes, he never confuses the description in the Bhagavatam and the description in the Vedas about material world, Vaikunthaloka and Svargaloka. There is no confusion. The two are completely different. So Prabhupada explains that very carefully, the difference between Svarga or any upper planet where there is so much of opulence and the opulence in Vaikuntha. The pleasure of the inhabitants of Vaikunthaloka. A clear distinction is given by Prabhupad."

So such mayavadis, when they come in contact with a pure devotee and are fortunate to be blessed, of course the pure devotees want to bless everyone, but are fortunate to accept the blessings of the pure devotee, then immediately they begin to realize that the absolute truth is impersonal, localized and personal, three features of absolute truth. And that's the localized feature. The absolute truth, a higher understanding of the absolute truth, superior knowledge and the personal feature is the highest understanding, topmost understanding of the absolute truth, complete understanding, perfect understanding. So that is only because of the mercy of pure devotee and we are fortunate souls to have accepted this mercy. Therefore for us it's very clear what is Brahman, what is Paramatma, what"

Seven doors are there to enter the personal abode of the, in Vaikunthapuri. There are so many devotees, millions of, billions of devotees. But they were trying to, eager to see the Lord.

      "transcript": "See. Devotees render all kinds of service to the Lord, all kinds of service. So these doorman, they are standing in seven doors, pair of doorman. So that description is also there in other parts of the scriptures, other places in the scriptures, the names of these doorman. The seventh door, Jaya and Vijaya. Those who do Narasimha Homa, you have some mantras, no? Chanda Prachanda Abhyam Namaha. What are the names there? Huh? Bala Prabala Abhyam Namaha. If you know Sanskrit language, the, Prabala Abhyam means Dvitiya, Vachana, two of them, unto them, unto Bala and Prabala, I am offering this, Ganda Pushpa. You see. So there are names of these pairs of doorman. First door, second door, third door, sixth, fourth door, fifth, sixth. None of them stopped these Kumaras. They freely were walking. Now, how do the Kumaras look? That is very important. They look like five-year-old small children. What is the reason? It is explained earlier, I think. Somewhere Prabhupada has explained earlier. I didn't read that explanation here, that they purposely keep themselves in a form, the assembling small children because when they were very serious about self-realization, they realized that this sex impulse that is there in this material world when one grows up and attains adulthood, there is naturally that sex impulse. And one has to actually overcome that sex impulse if one is serious about self-realization or spiritual life. One has to practice Brahmacharya and then follow these Brahmachari principles even after attaining adulthood. Continue to follow the Brahmacharya principles so that one will not become a victim of this sex desire. Now, these Kumaras are very intelligent transcendentalists. They thought that this sex impulse is going to bother us and Brahmacharya principles have to be followed whole life. So, using the yogic siddhi, they maintained the body of five-year-olds. So, when the body is kept like that, there will be no sex impulse at all. Like small children, they will not have any sex impulse, no sex impulse. So, they are freely able to practice spiritual life without any botheration by this"

      "transcript": "sex impulse. That means, right in the beginning, they had very clear goal of life. Goal of life was self-realization. And that goal, they were fixed even when they were small children. Even when they were small children, they were fixed on that goal. And very quickly they attained the siddhi. They attained the siddhi very quickly. Because, by birth itself, they were not interested in entering family life, having children, wife, all this they were not interested. So, they refused their father, that they will not be entering family life. So, Brahma, immediate reaction was, he became angry. How can you refuse your father? And that too, he is asking them to help him, to assist him in the process of creation. So, Brahma was very angry. He was very angry, but very soon Brahma realized, oh, they are very advanced spiritually. That's why they are refusing. It's not because, I don't like to enter family life. Don't bother me. Not like that. It's not because they don't like to enter or bother some headache, wife, children, all this. No, not with that understanding. They mature in their understanding. What is family life? So, that's why many times Prabhupada also explains, a devotee should understand, if a devotee, somebody is serious about self-realization, or more importantly, Krishna realization, then he should understand that this family life is a concession, for those who want to enjoy sex life, in a restricted way, regulated way. So, if the goal is, Krishna realization, and one has practiced Brahmacharya, then why enter Guru's Tashrama? No need. No need to enter Guru's Tashrama. To fix in the goal, and you have to pursue that, for which we have joined, this movement. Correct? So, why enter Grihastha life? Guru's Tashrama? Family life? Why enter family life?"

Just on the spur of the moment, he became upset. But immediately, he could understand, that they are not refusing because, they don't want botheration, or they don't like to enter family. No. They are refusing because, they have fixed in their goal of self-realization, for which this Naishika Brahmacharya, is very very very, very very conducive. So, then he appreciated that. Very nice. So, now he is describing, they are looking like five-year-olds, but they are the oldest people in the Universe, among the oldest people. And they are liberated, they have done lot of Tapasya, they have studied all the Vedas, they are very very very mature, knowledgeable people. Correct? But, the doorman, the seventh pair of doorman, Jaya and Vijaya, they became upset. Why are these boys, simply roaming around, trying to enter, the Lord's abode? What business they have? Small children, what business they have? They just keep playing, and then, so they stopped. Now, this verse, doesn't describe they stopped. First, the description is, in the 28th verse, what did the, four Kumaras see? They saw two doorman, but that was not, anything new for them, because they had seen already doorman, first gate up to sixth gate, they had seen the doorman. Then, they got the doorman's voice. Why? Prabhupada explains that also. It is a child's nature, to enter any place, without any consideration of permission, or am I allowed to go? No idea of, I should not trespass some places, nothing like that. And children are not duplicitous, that means, they have no particular reason to enter, any particular room, simply they will go. Correct? And it is also told here, by Prabhupada, a child can enter any place, as no one checks him, generally children will not be stopped, when they go around here and there. They generally will not stop."

But here, the Kumaras, no question of crying, they are mature adults actually, and, their anger, was meant to, punish this doorman, why are you stopping us? And it is also described here, by Prabhupada, that the first six doormen, did not stop. Only the seventh, door, they were stopped. Of course, this 29th verse, doesn't describe they have stopped. In the 30th verse, it is described, 29th verse it says, 28th verse, it says, first of all, the doorman saw, who are these four, small children? So, they raised their eyebrows, as if, what do you want? Like that. And, they were breathing heavily, discontented nostrils. Hmm? Sputha, nirgama bhyam. Like, becoming angry, or becoming upset, or thinking that some unnecessary disturbance, nuisance. They snorted, like this. And, their eyes were anyway reddish. It appeared like, they were, angry. Appeared like that. Their eyes were reddish anyway. With reddish eyes, discontented nostrils, arched eyebrows, they appeared somewhat agitated. Rabhasam dadhano. They appeared agitated. Why are you coming? Simply disturbing, creating nuisance. That kind of, ah, that kind of, disposition they had, towards the Kumaras. And, the next verse will, 30th verse will describe, they stopped. But, the 20, 29th verse, it says, the great sages, had open doors everywhere. They had no idea of ours and mine. They completely liberated. They know, everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. Nothing belongs to anybody. So, with open minds, they tried to enter the seventh door, as they had passed the six doors, which were all made of golden diamonds. Why is it being said, made of golden diamonds, those doors? It's not like the material world. It is completely different. But, the Kumaras are liberated. So, they have no attraction for these gold and extraordinary opulence. They have no such desire or any such special attraction for opulence like that. No. Why? Because, they are very eager to see the Supreme Lord. Very eager to see the Supreme Lord. So, therefore, they were thinking, why these doormen are agitated in the mind? And further, it will be described, they stopped even using the stick. Stop! Where are you going? Like that. So, then we will hear what happened"
