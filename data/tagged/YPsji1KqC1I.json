      "transcript": "Hare Krishna Prabhu, when should one chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra? The best time to chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra is after a long sleep, when you wake up, because your mind is fresh. The reason being, a fresh mind is required. What does a fresh mind mean? Once you start your day, so many thoughts, this and that, it keeps like a guna, kala, karma will be churning inside you, and something and all will be coming in your mind. In the midst of that, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare... So one side you are mechanically chanting, the other side all this thinking is going on. So that is not a quality chanting. You are not touching, unless the shabda that you chant goes inside through your ears into the heart. Effectiveness is very less. As I said, it is a science. If you take a piece of iron and keep it near the fire, you will get a little heat. Put it inside the fire, red hot. A little far away, a little heat. So you want a little heat from Hare Krishna, or you want a full fire? Full fire means attentively, early morning, before your day's prarabdha karma starts, finish your association. Finish your association with Krishna. Krishna will run your day. Your life will become smooth. He will run your day. Externally there may be so many difficulties. External difficulty is not the measure of difficulty."
