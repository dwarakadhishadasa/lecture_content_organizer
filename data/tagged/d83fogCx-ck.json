      "transcript": "Naravyagra, three-fold miseries, miseries due to three different causes, which is always there in material existence. Tapatraya, in Kannada they say tapatraya. What is this tapatraya? Tapa means miseries, traya means three kinds. Three kinds of fundamental miseries are always part of this material existence and they have been described here as divyaan, bhavmaan, daihikaan. Divyaan is the celestial influences, supernatural powers over which you have no control, just like rain. Too much rain or no rain. Divyaan is misery for people on the earth. They have suffered in so many ways. Or too much heat or too much cold. Or too much of wind. All these are sufferings. Earthquake, tsunami, volcanoes, so many celestial influences. Daihikaan is due to earthly reactions, different kinds of reactions due to other living entities. Other living entities, they give us trouble in so many ways, mosquitoes and wild animals, enemies and all kinds of pathogens, infectious germs. So they give us so much of trouble, miseries we suffer, and bodily pains, our own body, indigestion or some malfunctioning of some organ or some injury or some fatigue or some deficiency in some senses, we suffer in so many ways. So all are actually very dangerous. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, \"Material advancement of civilization means advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries due to celestial influence, earthly reactions, and bodily or mental pains.\""

      "transcript": "So this is a very important statement we have to understand and we have to internalize. We are very proud of material advancement. What is it that actually has brought about this advancement? Advancement, material advancement means, Prabhupada says, \"Advancement of the reactions of the three four miseries.\" So there are more miseries. People used to live simple life because of which there were less dangers, less accidents, less complications, less problems. You see many of the diseases called psychosomatic diseases, they are all occupational hazards. Middle-age and occupation itself did not exist, so where is the question of any occupational hazard when the occupation doesn't exist? For example, people sit in front of a terminal and work for eight hours or ten hours continuously and then they develop some back pain, neck problem, eye problem, or they develop some headache and some of these are chronic problems. They are not just coming and disappearing after some time. No, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year they work like that and then they develop permanent problem with the neck or with the back. So or with the hands, fingers. I know a person who keeps on typing, was typing, typing, typing and the finger movement itself has become very painful and doctors told, \"No more you can use your fingers in that way.\" So the person is skilled in typing and if it's told you cannot type, you should not type, how will he earn his livelihood? What will he do to earn his living? So many problems. There is no need of typing in the last about fifteen hundred years back. So they had simple occupation and they will live in a simple life, so they didn't have any of the complications that we have in the modern times."

The aggregate result is the agony of the body and the mind. Whichever the type of misery ultimately it affects our body or our mind or both. Man-made material science cannot do anything to counteract these threefold miseries. These miseries have always existed. It's not in modern times we have eliminated some of the miseries, no, they've always existed and they continue to harass us in this material world. So Srila Prabhupada says, \"They are all punishments from the superior energy of Maya under the direct advice of Upadhyaya.\" This is the clear statement of the pray or not, we are all punished by the laws of nature. Laws of nature are the same restriction of supreme law. We violate, we misbehave and therefore we are punished by the laws of nature. Laws of nature are fair, they're perfectly just, but we are the ones who are individually and collectively violating the laws and we are to suffer the consequences."

      "transcript": "body. This is called the science of nimitta. In the Vedic literature there is a, there is a whole compilation of certain symptoms which forebode undesirable happenings, like for example the left side of Yudhishthira's body is quivering, is shaking and there is also quivering in the arms and the eyes and the thighs again and again. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, \"Material existence is full of undesirables. Things you do not want are forced upon us by some superior energy and we do not see that these undesirables are on the grip of the three modes of material nature.\" Nature is working, three gunas are always acting. We don't have control over the gunas. The gunas are forcing upon us their influence, sometimes desirable, sometimes undesirable. When a man's eyes, arms and thighs are all quivering constantly, one must know that something is going to happen which are undesirable. Without your movement of the eye, the eye is quivering, is shaking without your moment, then it is to be understood that something undesirable is going to happen in the near future. These undesirables are compared to a fire in a forest. Why? No one goes into the forest to set fires, but fires automatically take place in the forest creating inconceivable calamities for the living beings of the forest. When there's a forest fire there's so much destruction and so many living entities are killed, burnt alive, roasted in the forest fire when they cannot escape. Such a fire cannot be extinguished by human efforts. The fire can be extinguished only by the mercy of the Lord who sends clouds to pour water on the forest. When there's a torrential rain, a big rain cloud pours heavily down water on the forest, the portion where there is fire spreading, then the fire can be extinguished, otherwise there's no possibility of any human intervention. Similarly undesirable happenings in life cannot be checked by individuals. Such miseries can be removed only by the mercy of the Lord who sends his bona fide representatives to enlighten human beings and thus save them from all calamities. Srila Prabhupada has come, he's come to save us from all these calamities by Krishna consciousness. That's the way to receive the mercy of the Lord, chanting Hare Krishna and doing it as directed by Prabhupada, by the representative of Krishna. He teaches exactly what to do, how to do it and if you follow sincerely, faithfully, we will definitely overcome all undesirables and will be successful ultimately in our life in going back to God. I'll stop here. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna."
