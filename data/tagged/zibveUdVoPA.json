The conclusion is that no one can be the benefactor of the Lord; everyone is actually the servant of the servant of the Lord. Rajottam Das ends the Bhaktivedanta purport."

Who are the others? Prabhupada says in the purport: those who are seeking the Goddess of Fortune are the Devatas, the Brahmanas, the Vaishnavas, and everyone else, they are seeking blessings, the favor, the mercy of the Goddess of Fortune. That Goddess of Fortune, she waits upon the Supreme Lord Narayana, Lakshmi Narayana, correct? So Lakshmi waits upon Narayana, for she is anxious to secure a place in the abode of the King of Bees, which is the abode of the King of Bees: Madhu, Vrata, Pater, Dhamma, Dhamnaha. The King of Bees actually is hovering over the fresh Tulasī leaves, which are all over the place, always permanently situated at the lotus feet of the Lord. So the lotus feet of the Lord is the most desired place in the entire Vaikuntha."

The verse which describes the nine types of devotional service is spoken by Prahlad Maharaj. Once Hiranyakashipu called his son, after he had finished some Gurukul education, said, \"What is the best of what you have learnt in the Gurukul?\" So he was expecting the son will tell something about economic development, sense gratification, administration, politics, diplomacy. That's what he wanted his son to learn, and that's what the teachers also were willing to teach in the Gurukul, Shanda and Amarka, two sons of Shukracharya. Instead, Prahlad was not interested in learning all that. He had already learnt whatever he had to learn when he was in the mother's womb. He had learnt from Narada about Bhakti, and that is the highest education, highest knowledge, king of all knowledge. That's what Krishna says in the ninth chapter, Raja Vidya. What is that Raja Vidya? Bhakti is the highest knowledge of all knowledge, Bhakti, pure devotional service. So that he had already learnt."

This is number four in that list of nine varieties of devotional service. First is Shravanam, second one is Kirtanam, third one is Smaranam, so after that, fourth one is Pada Sevanam. So Shravanam, Kirtanam, Smaranam, Pada Sevanam are the four kinds of devotional service. Shravanam, Kirtanam, Smaranam, Pada Sevanam are the four kinds of devotional service: hearing, chanting, remembrance. The fourth one is Pada Sevanam. One obtains the perfection of remembering when one constantly thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord. The perfection of remembrance of the Lord is possible when one constantly thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord. Being intensely attached to thinking of the Lord's lotus feet is called Pada Sevanam. See, we should carefully read and hear. We think Pada Sevanam means go and serve the lotus feet, which is correct, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, but what are the ways in which you can serve the lotus feet of the Lord? One of the ways is intentionally, intensely thinking, intensely attached to thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord is called Pada Sevanam, you see, intensely attached to thinking of the..."

But what is the symptom of, let us say, somebody is intensely attached to chanting? What is the symptom of such a person? What can we say? Eagerness to chant more. But how do we know that he has got eagerness to chant more? Huh? Always chanting. Constantly chanting. What is the astakur? What is he doing? Always chanting. Three lakh names a day. Almost 24 hours. Almost 24 hours chanting Hare Krishna. So that is intense attachment for devotional service. So Prabhupada in many places he says a pure devotee is 24 hours daily engaged in serving the Lord. That is because of intense attachment to serving the Lord. So one way of Pada Sevanam that's distinctly described here in the purport is being intensely attached to thinking of the Lord's Lotus Feet. Intensely attached to thinking means always want to think of the Lord's Lotus Feet."

So all such places one wants to reside, any of such places one wants to reside and render service, the same service, constantly engaged in chanting and hearing. Then that leads to, chanting and hearing leads to constant chanting and hearing, by following the rules. Constant chanting and hearing leads to residing in a holy place in Mathura or in Vrindavan, in order to do such service. That means one wants to do this service, devotional service, in the association of devotees."

For at least some of us, it would have been the impetus to join, so that we can nicely stay amidst devotees and do seva. We might have been doing seva outside, but one of the impetus for joining is, we can stay amidst devotees and completely engage in devotional service. So similarly, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur explains, that a progressive devotee goes through these stages. I will read that portion in Nectar of Instruction, because sometimes devotees think that Prabhupada has not given details beyond sadhana bhakti, how to execute sadhana bhakti practically. Practical tips, practical description Prabhupada has not given. Actually he has given that."

So in the purport, it's a very big purport, I'll read this portion of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's... So he says, one who has not yet developed interest in Krishna consciousness should give up all material motives and train his mind by following the progressive regulated principles, namely chanting and remembering Krishna and his name, form, quality, pastimes, and so forth. Chanting and remembering. Rasana manasi niyodhya. Tongue. You have to vibrate the tongue. Not chanting in the mind. Chanting by vibrating the tongue. And of course, one has to engage the mind in remembering. So for remembering in the mind, one has to not only chant, one should also hear. Chanting and hearing constitutes remembrance. Attentively. Chanting and hearing attentively constitutes remembrance. So here, one should practice without material motives chanting and remembering Krishna and his name, form, quality, pastimes. In this way, after developing a taste for such things, for chanting and remembering constantly, one should try to live in Vrindavan and pass his time constantly remembering Lord Krishna's name, fame, pastimes, and qualities under the direction and protection of an expert devotee."
