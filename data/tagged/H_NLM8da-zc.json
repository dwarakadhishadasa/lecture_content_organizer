      "transcript": "In this session we will be discussing from the 25th verse of the 12th chapter of the 1st canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. This will be discussed in two parts. So in this session we will discuss part 2. The verse, 25th verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: This child will be like Bali Maharaj in patience, a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna like Prahlad Maharaj, a patient devotee of Lord Krishna like Prahlad Maharaj, a performer of many Ashwamedha sacrifices, and a follower of the old and experienced men. Four different qualities are glorified about Pariksit by the brahmanas while foretelling about the greatness of the child when he grows up. So the first comparison is made that this child will be like Bali Maharaj in patience. So the history of Bali Maharaj is described as this, described again in the Bhagavatam in detail, great detail in the 8th canto, in connection with the pastime of Lord Vamanthi. So Srila Prabhupada says, one of the 12 authorities, Bali Maharaj is one of the 12 authorities in devotional service of the Lord, Mahajana Dvadash Mahajana. Bali Maharaj is a great authority in devotional service because he sacrificed everything to please the Supreme Lord and relinquished the connection with the Lord. He sacrificed everything to please the Supreme Lord and relinquished the connection with the Lord. He has a close connection with the so called spiritual master who obstructed him on the parts of risking everything for the service of the Supreme Lord. Now in the brief history of Bali Maharaj, because the comparison is made, how great was Bali Maharaj in being very, very patient, being very patient, that's how this Pariksit will also be very patient."

      "summary": "The speaker narrates the story of Vamanadeva's appearance as a Brahmachari and his visit to Bali Maharaj's sacrificial arena, highlighting Bali's respectful reception and offer of charity.",
      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/H_NLM8da-zc?t=175",
      "transcript": "So the description is, so the description is that the Supreme Lord appeared as Vaman Dev, as the son of Aditi and Kashyapa and he particularly came on the request of Aditi. So, Vaman Dev wanted to satisfy Aditi's desire that Aditi's sons headed by Indra who had lost their kingdom to Bali Maharaj, they get back their kingdom. So, Vaman Dev came to actually restore Indra's kingdom by taking it away in a way of tricking Bali Maharaj and Vaman Dev took away from Bali Maharaj by trickery and gave it to Indra. So, what was Bali's reaction to all this? That is very nicely described here. So, Vaman Dev as soon as he appeared, he disguised himself as a small Brahmachari boy and visited the sacrificial arena where Bali Maharaj was performing sacrifices. Now, Vaman Dev appeared in the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaj with his transcendentally effulgent form. Because he is the Supreme Lord, his form is full of transcendental effulgence called Brahmajyoti. So, normally the Lord in the material world will not display his Brahmajyoti. Then nobody will be able to see him. So, he partially displayed his transcendental effulgence and all the priests in that sacrificial arena they stood up from their seats and offered all respects and prayers to this Brahmachari. Of course, they didn't know it is Vaman Dev. So, they thought some very, very, very austere Brahmachari, some great personality. We do not know who he is. He has appeared with this effulgence which is very, very dazzling. And they stood up in respect and offered prayers to him. Now, so Vaman Dev was received very respectfully by Bali Maharaj as a Brahmachari boy. And Bali immediately washed the feet of this Brahmachari who is Lord himself as Vaman Dev and sprinkled that water that washes the feet of the Brahmachari on his head. And then Bali Maharaj inquired Vaman Dev that you may ask me for some dana. Either you may ask for some money or jewels or anything else you might desire. Because I am the emperor of the world. So, you may ask me anything that you desire."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/H_NLM8da-zc?t=371",
      "transcript": "Now, Vaman Dev praised Bali Maharaj. And Vaman Dev actually asked Bali Maharaj that I will be satisfied with just three paces of land measured by my footprint. A small Brahmachari boy, how much will his footprint be? So, Bali Maharaj thought this Brahmachari, even though he is so bright and effulgent and very, very, very austere, he does not have sufficient experience what to ask. So, Bali Maharaj said I can give you something much more than that. And he offered to give more. But Vaman Dev described to Bali Maharaj that one should be satisfied with the minimum necessities. Otherwise, there is no end to one's desire for possessing more and more and more. So, then Bali Maharaj hearing this enlightening words from this Brahmachari, he became very impressed and said, Oh, you are very, very learned and even realized. Okay, according to your desire, whatever you want, I am ready to give you, offer you in charity. I will give you three steps of land measured by your footprint. So, then when he is about to accept to give, agree to give, immediately Shukracharya stopped him. Stop. My dear King, please stop. What is the matter? So, then Shukracharya said, You do not know who this Brahmachari boy is. He is actually Vishnu disguised as a Brahmachari boy. He has come here on behalf of the devatas, our enemies. And he has come to take away your entire kingdom, on the plea of taking three steps of land in charity, he is going to take away your entire kingdom. So, beware, do not give what he is asking for in charity, because he has come to cheat you. So, then Bali Maharaj heard Shukracharya and he considered that Bali Maharaj thought it is the duty of a householder to maintain the principles of religion. And he thought it improper to withdraw his promise to the Brahmachari. Even if this Brahmachari is Vishnu. And even if he is going to take away everything I possess still, I do not want to go back on my promise, because lying is a sinful activity. So, I should not go back on my promise. And therefore, I want to give this Brahmachari whatever I have promised."

So, Bali Maharaj finally against the instruction of his guru Shukracharya, he decided to nevertheless give away three steps of land as Vaman Dev in the form of that Brahmachari had asked in charity. So, then what did Vaman Dev do? He immediately after getting that ascent, ascent, ascent of the, of Bali Maharaj. Vaman Dev expanded himself into a universal body. Because he is the Supreme Lord. He has got a form called the universal form. So, he displayed that universal form of his, means as big as the whole universe. And Bali Maharaj could see that the Lord is all pervading and everything resting in his body. And then Bali Maharaj could also see that this gigantic form the Brahmachari is displaying is actually the form of Lord Vishnu. Because Vishnu's mark of Srivatsa and his Kaustubha jewel and his crown and his ornaments and flower garland and everything that is decorating his body, Bali Maharaj could clearly see. So, what did Vaman Dev do after expanding himself into a universal body? He covered the entire surface of the world by extending his body and covered the entire sky. So, with one step he covered the earth and all the lower planets completely. And then with his second footstep he covered the entire upper planetary system. And there was no vacant place where he could place his third footstep. Then what happened? The Devatas headed by Brahma they certainly were very much attracted by the wonderful form of the Lord and his wonderful pastime of covering everything in the universe by his two footsteps. So, Brahma accompanied by great sages offered humble prayers to worship the Supreme Lord. They could recognize here is the Supreme Lord and he has appeared for the sake of favoring Indra."

And they wanted to attack this Brahmachari boy who is now in this form, universal form. And they attempted but immediately Vishnu's associates defeated all the associates of Bali Maharaj and sent them to the lower planets. And then Bali Maharaj was arrested by the ropes of Varuna by Garuda the carrier of Lord Vishnu. But when Lord Vishnu said to Bali Maharaj you have not fulfilled your promise to give me three steps of land. Where do I place my third step? So, then Bali Maharaj, he explained to Lord Vamana, Lord Vishnu that I have given away whatever is my possession. But I am still there. So, I will give my head in charity as the place for Lord Vishnu's third step. Now, that was very very pleasing to Lord Vishnu. Look at the patience of Bali Maharaj. He is completely bereft of all his possessions. He has been taken, all his possessions have been taken away and he is nothing. And still he is offering his own self, Atma Nivedanam. Of course, Bali Maharaj is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. So, the Lord performed this pastime to glorify Bali Maharaj and show to the whole world that my devotees are so very dedicated to my seva, that they are willing to give up everything just to please me, to satisfy me, to serve me. In this way, Bali Maharaj proved to be very very successful in his conduct as giving charity. So, his patience was tested by Lord Vamana Dev and he became successful. So, similarly Pariksit also will be very very patient. I will stop here. Thank you very much."
