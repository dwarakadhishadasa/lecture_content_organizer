      "transcript": "It is right across the stream. This is the southernmost part we would be in Bangladesh. After this, we would move northwards. In fact, your mobile phone will show home time. This is not the exact time, right? It shows 4.15, but it's actually 4.45, because mobile phone thinks you are back in India. Many pastimes were there, of Haridas Thakur, miraculous pastimes, small, different places. There is one mentioned here in Chaitanya. There's a story of Haridas Thakur, a snake charmer and a snake. One day, in the courtyard of a rich man's house, a snake charmer was performing a snake dance. He was chanting a special mantra accompanied by musicians playing the Mridanga and Manjira. Haridas was passing by and stood to one side watching the snake dance. Although the snake charmer was an ordinary human being, by the influence of his mantra he could dance as though the spirit of the king of the snakes Ananta Sesha possessed him. With an enchanting melody he sang about the pastime of Lord Krishna in the lake called Kaliadaha where the Lord had vanquished an evil serpent called Kalia. Haridasa listened intently to the pastime of his beloved Lord Krishna and he suddenly moved by ecstasy he fell unconscious to the ground when he regained consciousness. He jumped to his feet and rode like a lion, dancing in ecstasy as he babbled with joy. The snake charmer was impressed by the manifestation of ecstatic symptoms in Haridas Thakur's body and stood respectful to the sight. As the various symptoms of horripilation, crying and shivering traversed Haridas' body, he rolled in the dust, crying in love for Krishna. He remembered how his beloved Lord had mercifully saved the snake Kalia and as he floated in ecstatic trance, the people around him obliged by singing songs about the wonderful pastimes of the Lord. The snake charmer simply stood to the sight, overcome by awe and reverence for Haridas."

      "transcript": "When his ecstasy subsided, Haridas left and the snake charmer resumed his performance. Everyone who witnessed the ecstasy of Haridas felt spiritually accelerated and they smeared their bodies with dust from his feet. However, one cunning and insightful Brahmana in the crowd decided to cheat the people. He also started dancing. He told himself, I can see that the people are not very intelligent. They are offering so much respect to this low-born Haridas, just because he dances and cries. If I, a Brahmana, also dance and cry, then they will certainly worship me as well. The Brahmana threw himself on the ground and feigned unconsciousness as though he had fallen into trance. However, as soon as he touched the ground, the dancing snake charmer became furious, picked up a stick and began beating the Brahmana relentlessly. He struck him repeatedly. He hit him on every part of his body until the Brahmana, howling in agony, got up and ran away just to save his life. The snake charmer then resumed his dance while the entire crowd stood dumbfounded. At last, a man with folded hands humbly requested the snake charmer to explain why he had stood respectfully to the side while Haridas danced, yet he had beaten the Brahmana for what seemed to be the same activity. The spirit of Ananda Sesha, who dwelt within the snake charmer, then spoke in glorification of Srila Das Thakura. The subject matter of your inquiry is very confidential. Although such a topic is rarely discussed, because of its highly esoteric nature, I shall nevertheless answer your question. When Srila Das Thakura was dancing in ecstatic trance, each one of us felt it. Our respect and affection for him spontaneously increased. However, the deceitful Brahmana was simply imitating Haridasa in order to get some cheap adoration from the crowd, not out of love for Krishna, but out of enviousness towards a pure devotee. The Brahmana threw himself on the ground in ecstasy. Furthermore, he interrupted by dancing. Since he disturbed me and tried to imitate the pure devotee, I punished him severely. This arrogant and deceitful Brahmana has no love for Krishna. To receive the shelter of devotional service at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, one has to become pure, free from deceit. By seeing Srila Haridas Thakura dance, one becomes liberated from material bondage. Even the Supreme Lord Krishna himself dances when he sees Srila Dasa Thakura dance. The entire universe becomes cleansed of all sinful reactions just by seeing Srila Haridas dance."

He is free from any fault or offense towards the Supreme Lord or his devotees. Even in his dreams, he never commits an offense. A moment's association with Haridasa can purify any living entity and assure him the eternal shelter of Lord Krishna's lotus feet. Even Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva constantly desire his association. Haridas appeared in the family of a lowly Muslim on the order of the Supreme Lord, just to teach human society that material designations like caste, creed, birth, status and family positions are all illusory and pursuing them is futile. A pure devotee of the Lord is born in a low-class family. He is no less worthy of worship. This is injunction of the scriptures."

Just to prove the truth of these scriptures, Srila Haridas took birth in a low-caste family. Prahlad Maharaj, one of the greatest devotees of the Lord, had previously appeared in a family of demons. And Hanuman, the greatest devotee of Lord Ramachandra, took birth in the monkey species. The demigods desired the touch of the pure and transcendental form of Srila Haridas Thakura. And Ganga Mata also prays that her water will be sanctified by his presence. However, one need not touch Srila Das Thakura. By seeing him, simply by seeing him, one is automatically freed from the eternal cycle of birth and death. Furthermore, one who sees a devotee who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Srila Haridas Thakura is also granted freedom from material bondage. Neither a thousand mouths nor a thousand ears would be sufficient to describe and hear the wonderful qualities of Srila Haridas Thakura. You are a fortunate soul, for your inquiry has given me an opportunity to glorify the pure devotee and has given you the opportunity to hear the transcendental topic. From the moment a person speaks the name Srila Haridas Thakura, his ascension to the supreme abode of Lord Krishna is guaranteed."

      "transcript": "There is one more pastime in Chaitanya Charitamrita. Haridas Thakur walked until he came to the village of Chandapura, later known as Krishnapura, where he stayed at Balaram Acharya's house. Balaram Acharya was the family priest of Hiranya and Govardhana Majumda. Due to receiving his favour, Balaram Acharya was very attached to Haridas Thakur, and thus, he provided all his needs with great care and attention. Haridas Thakur was given a cottage in a secluded place and he came daily to Balaram Acharya's house to accept prasad. At that time, Raghunath Das was a schoolboy and he used to come and see Haridas Thakur every day. Naturally, Haridas Thakur was very merciful towards him, and as a result, Raghunath Das later on attained to his love. Haridas Thakur was immediately sheltered at the lotus feet of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Regular discourses were held at the residence of Hiranya and Govardhana. One day, Balaram Acharya very humbly invited Haridas Thakur to come there. Upon seeing Haridas Thakur arrive, the two Majumdaras immediately stood up and then fell at his lotus feet to offer obeisances. There were many learned scholars, brahmanas and respectable gentlemen in that assembly, and Hiranya and Govardhana were also greatly learned. As the two brothers very respectfully offered Haridas Thakur a sitting place, everyone began to speak about his exalted qualities as if they each possessed five mouths. Hiranya and Govardhana were very pleased to hear this talk. When it was mentioned how Haridas Thakur chanted 300,000 holy names daily, the learned scholars began to discuss the glories of the holy name of the Lord. Some of them said, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one is freed from all reactions to sinful activities. Others said, simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one becomes liberated from material bondage. Haridas Thakur protested. These two benedictions are not the true result of chanting the holy name of the Lord. If one actually chants the holy name without offences, his ecstatic love for the lotus feet of Lord Krishna is awakened."

      "timestamp_url": "https://youtu.be/pzMGkDdfoBE?t=786",
      "transcript": "In Srimad Bhagavatam, it is said, when a person is actually advanced and takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord, who is very dear to him, he becomes agitated, and thus sometimes laughs, sometimes cries, and sometimes chants loudly and dances without caring for outsiders. Liberation and the destruction of sinful reactions are two concomitant byproducts of chanting the holy name of the Lord. As the rising sun immediately dissipates all the world's darkness, so the holy name of the Lord, even if chanted only once without offences, dispels all of one's sinful reactions. Haridas Thakur questioned, O learned scholars, please explain the meaning of this verse. However, the audience responded, it would be better if you explain the meaning of this important verse. Haridas Thakur said, even before the sun rises in the morning, it dissipates the darkness of night with its dawning light, and thus all fear of thieves and ghosts immediately vanishes. Then, when the sun actually becomes visible, everything is clearly manifest and people begin performing their morning religious activities and other duties. Similarly, the first glimpse of offenceless chanting of the Lord's holy name immediately dissipates all reactions to sinful life. Then, when one is actually on the platform of offenceless chanting, there awakens a static loving devotional service to the lotus feet of Krishna. Liberation is thus the insignificant result derived from a mere glimpse of awakening of offenceless chanting. An example of such an effect of Nama Bhasa is seen in the life of Ajamila. Liberation, which is unacceptable to a pure devotee, is very easily offered by Lord Krishna."

      "transcript": "There was a person named Gopal Chakravarti staying at Hiranya and Govardhana's house. He was the chief tax collector, and it was his duty to collect 12 lakh coins and deposit them in the emperor's treasury. This caste brahmana had very handsome bodily features, and he was very learned and youthful. However, he could not tolerate hearing the statement that one can achieve liberation by glimpsing the awakening of pure chanting of the Lord's holy name. Becoming very angry, Gopal Chakravarti began criticizing Haridas Thakur as follows. O learned scholars, just hear the conclusion of this emotional devotee. After many millions of births, when one becomes complete in transcendental knowledge, one may still not attain liberation. Yet, this man says that it can be obtained simply by awakening a glimpse of the holy name of the Lord. Haridas Thakur replied, Why are you doubtful? Shastra clearly states that one can attain liberation simply by a slight glimpse of offenseless chanting. For the devotee who enjoys the transcendental bliss of devotional service, liberation is most insignificant, like the water containing within the hoof print of a calf. Gopal Chakravarti said, If one is not liberated by such namabasa chanting, then I shall certainly cut off your nose. Haridas Thakur accepted this challenge by saying, If by namabasa liberation is not available, then I shall certainly cut off my own nose. After hearing Gopal Chakravarti's challenge, everyone gathered there became very agitated, and while getting up from their seats, they made a tumultuous noise. Hiranya and Govardhana immediately went and began chastising Gopal Chakravarti, and Balram Acharya told him, You are a foolish logician. What do you know about the devotional service of the Lord? Since you have insulted Haridas Thakur, you have put yourself in a very dangerous position and so you should not expect anything auspicious. The two Majumdaras immediately dismissed Gopal Chakravarti from their service. Then, as Haridas Thakur got up to leave, they went along with the other members of the assembly and fell at his lotus feet. While smiling, Haridas Thakur spoke to them as follows in a very sweet voice, None of you are at fault. Indeed, even this ignorant so-called brahmana is not to be blamed, for he is accustomed to dry speculation and logic. One cannot understand the glories of the holy name of the Lord simply by mundane logic and argument."

Although his toes and fingers were as beautiful as golden champaka buds, they gradually withered away, and upon seeing Gopal Chakravarti's condition, everyone became highly astonished. While considering the wonderful influence of Haridas Thakur, everyone glorified him and offered him obeisances. Although Haridas Thakur did not take the brahmana's offences seriously, the Supreme Personality of God could not tolerate it and thus arranged for him to suffer the consequences. It is a characteristic of a pure devotee that he excuses any offences committed by an ignorant rascal. However, the characteristics of Lord Krishna is that he cannot tolerate blasphemy of his devotees. Haridas Thakur was unhappy to hear about how Gopal Chakravarti had been attacked by leprosy.

So, this material life, Sadhu Sanga, is so important that we learn how we associate with devotees of three different stages, as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said: devotees who are senior to us, devotees who are equal to us, and devotees who are junior to us. So, to all three levels, we need to have an appropriate relationship, a right way of dealing. We don't consider ourselves superior to the inferiors. Rather, we show mercy and teach them. To equals, we be very friendly, and together we serve the Supreme Lord. And towards the seniors, we humbly serve them."

So, we may be knowingly or unknowingly committing so many offences. So, every morning we say, devotees don't take the offence directly. But when devotees are offended, the Lord, even though He does not take offence to Him seriously, He will take the offence to His devotees seriously. So, we know the story of Ambarisha Maharaj. The story is here. Haridas Thakur, lowly born or highly born, educated, not educated, beautiful, ugly, black, white, doesn't matter. So, we need to pray to the Supreme Lord and the devotees to go past the externals of Ambarisha. One has to cross, looking at the Vaishnavas materially.

So, one has to, in the middle of many services and important roles we play in different places, it is always good to take some time off to visit Dhams with Vaishnavas. We can alone go two weeks, go around and come, but those two weeks, if we spend with Vaishnavas, the whole experience is totally different. So, we are coming here for Dham Seva. Not only Dham Seva, along with that Vaishnava Seva, and the greatest of Vaishnavas, Haridas Thakur."
