Ram is the greatest leader for the followers. He is the greatest leader for the entire human civilization because he took immense trouble, he went through tribulation just to keep up his promise, his family promise, his father's promise by giving away Ayodhya to his stepmother Kaikeyi and making Bharat as a king of Ayodhya. Ram could have easily become the king of Ayodhya, but he wanted to honor the words of his father, Dasharatha Maharaj. For that, he happily gave up Ayodhya and went to forest. Lord Ram teaches the importance of being truthful and honoring the promise and being respectful towards our own words."

      "transcript": "The moment the leader makes a promise, he must make all efforts to keep up his promise. Otherwise, the followers will question the credibility of your leadership. They may lose faith in your leadership because, oh, you say something, but you are not intending to follow your own promise. So Lord Ram is teaching a very important lesson to all the leaders, saying that no matter how difficult it is, no matter how troublesome in your own personal life, you must keep up your words. You must have a virtue, a value called integrity. There must be absolutely no gap between your action and your words. You must always, always walk the talk. And Lord Ram is an example for somebody who always walked what he talked. So that is the lesson Lord Ram teaches as a hero."
