The meaning of this verse is: Lazy human beings with paltry intelligence and a short duration of life pass the night sleeping and the day performing activities that are for naught. So here, the description is being given by Shounaka Rishi. There are the intelligent people who engage in hearing Bhagavatam and escape the slaughtering process of Yamaraj, they escape death, they pass on from this body to Krishna's abode for eternal life, and then there are lazy, less intelligent, foolish human beings also who miss out the rare opportunity in the human form of life to put an end to this suffering of death and disease and"

      "transcript": "old age. They are described here. First of all, their characteristic is such unfortunate people are lazy. They are lazy, especially they are lazy when it comes to exerting oneself to hear Bhagavatam, lazy when it comes to chanting Hare Krishna, lazy when it comes to avoiding sinful activities, they're lazy. And another characteristic is paltry inclinations, paltry intelligence, very, very little brain substance, they're less intelligent. They're less intelligent. Now, less intelligent, does it mean that some people are born less intelligent, so what can they do? No, this is not what is meant by less intelligent. Less intelligent means they misuse their intelligence for material sense enjoyment. They don't utilize their intelligence for spiritual activities, for spiritual knowledge. They don't use their intelligence properly. That's the meaning here. Please don't misunderstand this. And the third characteristic is that life in Kali Yuga is characterized by short duration, and even that short duration of life they are wasting, completely losing out all the time available in this human body. In what way? At night they are simply engaged in sleeping, and in the daytime they are engaged in useless activities which are not at all helpful for their conquering death, that are not meant for conquering death, that are not meant for gaining eternal life. They are simply a waste of time. So Prabhupada describes about this"

One has taken birth in this material world, in a material body, sure to die. That means has to quit the body. Now, after taking birth one has to live for certain number of years and quit the body, that's called death. Now, after quitting the body, if one is not prepared to go back to Godhead, one has to again take birth: dhruvam janmam ritasya cha. Birth is certain, another body, another term of suffering and misery. So this is called entanglement in the repetition of birth and death. So to get out of this is possible in the human form of life, and how do you take benefit of this human form of life to get out of the cycle of birth and death?"

They do not know what is this liberation from material bondage. They do not even know I am materially bound up, what is material bondage? See, as long as I have this body, this body is not me, but as long as I am in this body, the body becomes diseased, the body becomes old, the body becomes injured, the body becomes fatigued, the body becomes dirty, the body becomes infected, and I, the spirit soul, separate from the body, I suffer the infection, I suffer due to dirty conditions, I suffer due to injury, I suffer due to disease, I suffer due to old age. The body becomes old, I don't become old, spirit soul doesn't become old. So this is called material bondage, and living bondage, liberation from material bondage, what is that liberation from material bondage? To get out of this body and get a spiritual body, to never again enter another material body, to uncover our spiritual body, develop our spiritual body for spiritual life, that is the process."

So we have senses, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the skin, and we also have the genitals, we have the belly, we have the voice, we have hands, we have legs, all this, all these senses for the materialistic persons, for the less intelligent persons, for the foolish persons, for the lazy persons, for the unfortunate persons, simply they want to use these for enjoying, enjoying, enjoying, enjoying material happiness, material, material, and what they don't realize is by the laws of nature every creature including the lower animals, birds, worms, insects, the aquatics, the plants, every living being is allowed by nature to enjoy certain type of sense pleasure. Don't think human beings are the only one who are enjoying life and materially, even the hogs and dogs are enjoying this, this particularly pointed out by bhagavata,"

So therefore, Prabhupada says, one should definitely try to understand that sense enjoyment is not the ultimate goal of human life."

But that sense enjoyment is not at all giving us happiness or real pleasure. That's all. It doesn't give us happiness or pleasure, because it is a sensation by sense contact which is momentary, which is just for the short moment that there is contact. Just like you place one piece of sweet on your tongue, that contact, supposing you like that sweet, that sweet taste. Moment the contact there is some sensation of sweet taste, ah, so nice. But can you keep on telling, oh very nice, sweet taste, very nice, sweet taste, very nice, sweet taste, very nice, sweet taste, very nice. Can you keep on telling like that? No. That sweet taste, the sensation will last only for a moment. And then after that you have to place one more piece of sweet for one more sensation by contact. samsparishvaja bhoga. This is described in Bhagavad Gita. This material pleasure is nothing but the sense contact producing a sensation for a moment which we think is oh so nice, so enjoyable, so pleasure. But this is waste of time. There is spiritual happiness which is not momentary, which is not by sense contact, which is the natural pleasure of the soul,"
