These are the work of the great preachers, like we said in the morning, the first set of preachers after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, three people, three personalities: Srinivas Acharya, Narottam Das Thakur, and Shyamananda Prabhu. These were the first three preachers with the Shakti of Gauranga. All of them were very sad that they were born just after Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, they couldn't see Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, so they were the Shakti of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to initiate the preaching. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did a lot of preaching, but real organized preaching was done by these three personalities."

And then tomorrow, of course, we are in Bhaura-Hugli area, all the different small, small temples. Then we'll be going to Vishnupur, which is Srinivas Acharya's place. Then as we go towards the border of Bangladesh, we'll see Narottam Das Thakur's place. So we are basically seeing the three main preachers, their places are what is coming in this circuit. So many stories connected to these three personalities. They were sent by Jeeva Goswami to bring all the books of the Goswamis. All the Rupa Goswamis, Sanatan Goswami, all their books were brought, you know the story, on a big bullock cart the books were brought and it was stolen. So we'll be going day after tomorrow to the dacoit king's city called Vishnupur, very beautiful place. That is Srinivas Acharya. So we see the strength of the preaching of these acharyas all over Orissa and bordering of Bengal. Shyamananda did north Bengal, Srinivas Acharya did Bangladesh, Narottam Das Thakur, Srinivas Acharya went all the way to Tripura and also Manipur. So this whole place was actually preached, organized way, by these personalities."

The first Gopunima was done by him in Keturi ground. We'll see that, where Janava Mata himself, herself, and Nithyananda Prabhu's wife, she was present. So today also that is the same system we follow: go to your place, take a place, put, have the deities installed and start preaching. So this system is not something new, it is going on from Narottam Das Thakur's time onwards. They all went, installed duties, but the difference is that these personalities got deities and they dream, they got deities from Radharani. We have to make deities and then install them as Kali Yuga goes on."

But these preachers were Shakti away by themselves, Shyamananda, Narottam, Srinivas. So Shyamananda Prabhu, as we read a little bit in the previous temple, same line as Nithyananda. So we are also Nithyananda, coming down from Janava Mata and Narottam Das Thakur, Vishwanath Chakravarti. So this is our line. However, as far as these are concerned, they are a little different, even though they are from Nithyananda Prabhu's Vamsha because of the tilak mark, right? There's a little different, but basically..."

All the people said that he took reinitiation from Jeeva Goswami and Jeeva Goswami has changed his name from Dukhi Krishna to Shamananda. This whole kind of controversy erupted in Vandavan. So to solve this, his own Guru from Mayapur, from Ambika Kalna. From there, Gauridas Pandit's disciple Hridayachaitanya went all the way to Vandavan to settle this issue. But then finally, to make the story short, that it was proven that this Tilak was handed over by Radharani herself to Shamananda and he did not change anything. He considered Hridayachaitanya as his Guru, but Jeeva Goswami and Radharani did not change anything. He considered Hridayachaitanya as his Shiksa Guru for further preaching. So these great personalities went to Jeeva Goswami and Radharani who was a disciple of Lokannath, all went to Jeeva Goswami friend. for further preaching. So these great personalities all went to Jeeva Goswami friend. Narottam Dashtakul who was a disciple of Lokannath also went to Jeeva Goswami to learn. Shamananda, a disciple of Hridayachaitanya went to Jeeva Goswami to learn. And Srinivasacharya's disciple was..."

Prabhupada said Jiva Goswami is the authority, especially because of the shakshandarva he wrote conclusive truth about Krishna, Krishna is the Bhagavan Swayam. And then Baladeva Vidyabhushan, today morning you went to his birthplace. So these personalities actually fixed Gaudiya Vaishnavism as authorized parampara within the Madhya Gaudiya parampara. Especially the Ramanandis and the Ramanujacharyas, they were saying there is no authority to the Gaudiya Vaishnavism, where is your siddhanta coming from and where is your bhashya on the Brahma Sutras. Unless we have a bhashya on Brahma Sutras, we are not going to be able to understand Brahma Sutras. You are not considered an authorized line, because Sri Vaishnavas have their authorized bhashya, Madhya has their authorized bhashya. But what about Gaudiya Vaishnavism?"

So Prabhupada Goswami, Sanatana Goswami, Jeeva Goswami, Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur, Baladeva Vidyabhushan. And these three preachers, they were the solid foundation for Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to create a big foundation for Gaudiya Vaishnavism."

And then Bhaktivinoda Thakur had to establish another foundation with his 64 Gaudiya Maths. And then it was for our Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada to take it all over the world. Now Gaudiya Vaishnavism is like authority, people say, oh Janmashtami, the way ISKCON is doing, Abhishekam, the way ISKCON is doing, so ISKCON has become a kind of a, what do you call it, benchmark for Bhaktivinoda.

But there's a whole force behind that, there's a whole force behind this, there's a whole authority to books. There's a whole authority to conclusions and the whole tradition left by these people. So it's good that we take some time off and see all these places with the Vaishnavas to inspire ourselves and to charge ourselves and go and give it. The only difference is that these personalities we are preaching to people who are very simple. May not be very Vedic, what 50, 60, 100 or 200 years back or 300 years back, people were much more simple. But for us the challenge is we are preaching to hardcore, hardcore, we ourselves are hardcore materialists and we are preaching to hardcore materialists. So the difference is that. And they had the strength of Sanskrit and the strength of Vedic education. What do we have? We just parrot what Prabhupada said, that's it. But that voice of Prabhupada is so strong that it can change the world. Yes. It can change the hearts of thousands of people even though it is just going through our mouth. So we are just postman delivering the message of Prabhupada to the whole world. He is doing the preaching. So the great personality who is doing preaching now and continuing for next 10,000 years is Prabhupada."
