      "transcript": "World over, people are enchanted by Cupid, arrows of Cupid. Cupid shoots arrows, pierces our heart. We have that picture of a heart being pierced by an arrow, lusty desires. And Cupid is called Madan, and Krishna is called Madan Mohana, who enchants the Cupid, who is much, much more attractive, millions of times more attractive than the Cupid, so-called beauty in this material world. So if we get enchanted by Madan Mohana, if we worship Madan Mohan, if we surrender to Madan Mohan, if we follow the instructions of Krishna, Madan Mohan, which is given in the Bhagavad Gita, then Cupid has no place in our lives. We will not be tormented, will not be shot at by the Cupid, if we have experienced real love, real beauty of the Lord. Then we will experience that satisfaction, we will experience that higher taste."
