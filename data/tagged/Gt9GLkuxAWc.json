      "transcript": "This session will be discussing from the Srimad Bhagavatam, the first canto, sixth chapter. Sixth chapter is entitled Conversation between Narada and Vyasa Deva. This is the sixth verse I am going to read now. The meaning of this verse is: I was the only son of my mother who was not only a simple woman but a maid servant as well. Since I was her only offspring, she had no other alternative for protection. She bound me with the tie of affection. This is Narada Muni describing his previous life to Vyasa Deva. He is particularly answering Vyasa's question as to what did he do after initiation. So he was the only son of his mother. He was the only son of his mother and his mother was a maid servant doing some simple work and he was her only son. So she bound him up with her affectionate bondage. The next verse, the seventh verse. The meaning is: she wanted to look after my maintenance properly but because she was not independent, she was not able to do anything for me. The world is under the full control of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, everyone is like a wooden doll in the hands of a puppet master. So Narada Muni is explaining that the mother was having a plan to look after this boy very nicely. But we should always remember, none of us in this world are independent. The world is under the full control, complete control of the Supreme Lord. It is described here. Therefore, everyone is like a wooden doll in the hands of a puppet master. It is described here. Therefore, everyone is like a wooden doll in the hands of a puppet master. It is described here. So does it mean that what can we do? Whatever happens is completely under the control of the Supreme Lord. So we are kind of totally helpless."

But he also has given each of the human beings, particularly, a little free will, little independence. And we have to become responsible in properly utilizing the tiny amount of independence. Now this use of independence is dependent on our desires. In what way we want to cultivate our desires. In what way we want to cultivate our desires. So, depending on the desires and depending on our past karma, So, depending on the desires and depending on our past karma, the Supreme Lord arranges everything for a person, for each one of us. So, ultimately, the Supreme Lord is in control. Our specific enjoyment and suffering is due to our own actions, our desires. It is not imposed by the Lord. Desires are not imposed. Activities are not imposed. So, therefore, we have to carefully understand that, So, therefore, we have to carefully understand that, So, therefore, we have to carefully understand the statement here, So, therefore, we have to carefully understand the statement here, that we are not independent, that whatever we want, we can do. No. There is always a control. The supreme control. Not just a control, but the supreme control of the Supreme Lord. That we are bound up based on our past actions, and based on our desires, to have a certain freedom within a boundary. We are not having any absolute freedom."

The meaning of this verse is: When I was a mere child of five years, I lived in a Brahmana school. I was dependent on my mother's affection, and had no experience of different lands. Very limited scope for the boy to do anything. He was just a five-year-old boy. And he was living in a Brahmana school. And he was dependent on his mother. The next verse, further Narad Muni explains, describes, Ninth verse, Ekadā nirgatāṁ yehād, Duhantīṁ nishigāṁ patī, Sarpo adasat padās prishtah, Kripanāṁ kāla choditah.

      "transcript": "So, this is the supreme will of the Supreme Lord. So, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, That is the way of dragging a sincere soul nearer to God. The boy was bound up by his mother's affection. But, to release him from that bondage, the Lord has arranged something. What is that? The poor boy was being looked after only by his affectionate mother. And yet, the mother was taken away from the world by the supreme will, in order to put him completely at the mercy of the Lord. See, this is described here as the Lord's mercy upon this soul, Narada, in his previous life. Actually, each one of us is completely dependent entirely on the Supreme Lord. It is not just the case with this boy, Narada. It is the case with everyone. But, we have created artificial sources of dependence, based on some bodily connections. But, all these are simply the effect of the illusory energy. The body itself is the arrangement of the illusory energy. So, what to speak of the bodily connections? They are all completely governed by kala karma guna. So, there is no certainty how long a certain relationship will exist, and what will be the outcome of a certain relationship, at a certain time. Nobody can actually predict, or make a definite plan, though we try to make so many plans. But, all such plans are ultimately nullified,"

And, the mother was taken away, so that he could completely come to depend upon the Supreme Lord, who is the only available shelter, ultimately, and nobody else is the shelter. The tenth verse, tadātadaham īśasya bhaktānāṁśaṁ abhīpsatah anugrahaṁ manyamāṇaḥ prātiṣṭham diśaṁ uttarāṁ The meaning is: I took this as the special mercy of the lord, who always desires benediction for his devotees. And so thinking, I started for the north. So, Śrīla Prabhupāda explains, Confidential devotees of the lord see in every step a benedictory direction of the lord. What is considered to be an odd or difficult moment, in the mundane sense, is accepted as a special mercy of the lord. This is the position of a devotee. This boy was initiated, instructed, and enlightened by the sages, even when he was a very small boy. But he could understand, Oh, now that my mother is taken away from me, who is there for me, other than the Supreme Lord, nobody else. And therefore, this boy thought that it's the lord's mercy, that I have been placed in a situation where I exclusively have to depend on him. And, he understood that the lord has freed him from this bondage. And, as he was directed, or instructed by the sages, he actually started towards the north. North means going to the Himalayas for exclusively meditating upon the Supreme Lord, as directed by,"

      "transcript": "the saintly persons. So, it is explained here, mundane prosperity is a kind of material fever. And by the grace of the lord, the temperature of this material fever is gradually diminished. So, what we calculate according to our material calculation, that is not the proper understanding from the spiritual perspective. Just like fever is to be reduced. It's a symptom of an unhealthy body. Similarly, material prosperity, which may make us attached materially, or bound materially, is like a fever, unhealthy condition. So, when it comes down, then we come out of the bondage, material bondage. And that's what happened to Narada Muni. Of course, people do not understand this. Ordinary people do not understand this. It's only spiritual perspective which helps us understand this situation. So, I'll stop here. Thank you very much."
