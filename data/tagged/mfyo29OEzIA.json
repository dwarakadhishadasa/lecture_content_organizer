This is the section which describes Krishna's relationship with his queens, and Suta Goswami clarifies a very, very important point in this connection. The verse is as follows. The meaning of this verse is: Although the queen's beautiful smiles and furtive glances were all spotless and exciting, and although they could conquer Cupid himself by making him give up his bow in frustration, and although even the tolerant Shiva could fall victim to them, still, despite all their magical feats and attractions, they could not agitate the senses of the Lord."

      "transcript": "Now, Suta Goswami is describing the transcendental quality of the soul, of the Supreme Lord in his association with his 16,108 queens. What is the spiritual nature of the Lord? He is un-agitated by their association, even though they are very, very beautiful. They have beautiful smiles. They have very, very attractive glances. They can conquer Cupid himself. Cupid generally agitates the mind of materialistic people in this world to get attracted to material beauty, but Cupid himself becomes attracted by the beauty of these queens. And the Lord Shiva is known as a Dheera, but even Lord Shiva, He may fall victim to the attraction of the queens, but the queens can never agitate the senses of the Supreme Lord, which means that why did Upanishad interact with the queens as if he was engaged in a mundane love affair?"

      "transcript": "That is because of their devotion that we explained in the later verse. So here it is just stated by Suta Goswami that they could not agitate the senses of the Lord. So Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport, the path of salvation, that means the path of liberation from this material bondage, are a path going back to Godhead always forbids the association of women, and a complete Sanatana Dharma or Vanashrama Dharma scheme forbids or restricts association of women. Srila Prabhupada explains elsewhere three of the four ashramas completely forbid association with women: brahmachari ashram, vanaprastha ashram, and sannyas ashram, no association of women. Only in the Grihastha ashrama there is permission to associate with women, that also under highly restricted conditions, only with one wife, and that also for the sake of producing Krishna conscious children and becoming responsible, raising children and becoming responsible, raising a Krishna conscious family. All these are there, Grihastha ashrama, Grihastha Dharma. So Prabhupada raises this question, how then can one be accepted of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is addicted to more than 16,000 wives? Krishna seemed to be very much attached to those Queens, and He is one person, and He has 16,108 Queens and is attached to them, so what is the proper understanding? This question may relevantly be raised by inquisitive persons really anxious to know about the transcendental nature of the Supreme"

      "transcript": "Lord. And to answer such questions, the sages at Nainbi Sharanya have discussed the transcendental character of the Lord in this and in the following verses. What is that transcendental nature of Krishna different from the nature of people of this world? How is it different? So Srila Prabhupada further says, it is clear herein that the feminine attractive features which can conquer Cupid or even the supermost tolerant Lord Shiva could not conquer the senses of the Lord. Here is the difference, the distinct difference between Krishna and everyone else. Cupid's business is to invoke mundane lust. Mundane lust means his material lust. Material lust means materially attractive, material lust means material lust. Flute 아주 is the spirit with which the want of банal lust in spiritual earth is manifested. Extract love and karmically flow in the world instead of the lust. Tambad iramthis great 스ırहामि revenues from the the activities of the world are being carried on by the central attraction of male and female that is the central point of material existence a male is searching after a mate to his liking and the female is looking after a suitable male that is the way of material stimulus and as soon as a male is combined with a female the material bondage of the living being is at once tightly interlocked by sex relation and as a result of this both the males and females attraction for sweet home motherland bodily offspring wealth becomes the illusory"

      "transcript": "field of activities. A whole field of activities opens up. Man and woman marriage each other, and then the family expands, children and relation and relatives and friends and home and wealth and accumulation of wealth, a society, friendship, community, all these things become the illusory field of activities, and thus a false but indefatigable attraction for a temporary material existence which is full of miseries is manifest. See, material existence means miseries. Under illusion, we cannot understand that. We always think miseries are now and then coming and going, that's what we think, but actually we are always in the middle of miseries. Sometimes these miseries are overlooked, we are not cognizant of them, or it doesn't bother us as much as it may bother somebody else. Just like the climatic conditions are related for some people. A cold weather is very much related to the situation of the world. Some Ontarians say that the cold weather is pleasant for the people who are in the cold weather, and they dislike the cold weather because the body, the body is pleasant for them because their body somehow they have made it acclimatized to the cold weather by generating lot of heat within, and they like this cold weather, but in summer they just can't tolerate even a little bit of heat, they cannot tolerate. And then the other people are not tolerant of them, so that's a concept. Whose body is very warm, they are not so uncomfortable in summer, but in winter they can't tolerate little cold also. The fact is this is told by one Acharya Govinda Das Kaviraj. We are always harassed by four different material conditions, climatic conditions: Sheetha means cold, Vata. Sheetha-Atapa means heat and Vata means wind and varisolana-the rain."

      "transcript": "Cold, heat, wind, and rain, these are sometimes there in different times of the year, and they always bother us. One or the other botheration is there, but we are so determined to enjoy that we'll somehow make adjustment and try to live amid such conditions, unfavorable conditions, and try to create a favorable atmosphere by adjustment. This called material advancement of civilization, but the scriptures warn us and awaken us to the reality. It is temporary, and you are simply engaged in a hard struggle for existence. So those who are therefore on the path of salvation for going back home, back to Godhead, are especially advised by all scriptural instructions to become free from the bondage of the world and become free from the bondage of the world and from such paraphernalia of material attraction because material attraction makes us forget the reality. We go deeper into illusion because of material attraction between male and female, and how is this possible to become free from this paraphernalia of material attraction? It is possible only by association of the devotees of the Lord, were called Mahatmas...Mahar Manas Tummampartha Day目. The Mahatmas are the pure devotees, they are always under the shelter of the internal potency of the Lord, the spiritual potency, and they are always engaged in devotional service, and such Mahatmas association will help us to become free from material attraction. Now Prabhupada explains elaborately that this material world is such that Cupid's work is going on to keep the living entities under material bondage, but association of devotees helps us to come out of this material bondage by losing attraction for all material things, by developing spiritual attraction to come out of this bondage. Krishna, it is not done in a void. It is possible by positive spiritual attraction, and that positive spiritual attraction is by association of pure devotees, association of pure devotees."

Similarly, if we situate ourselves on the spiritual platform, all material attraction will be nullified, attractions will be nullified completely, and we get attracted to Krishna, which is desirable, which is most desirable, which is the best, the safest, and the topmost position of perfection for any living being to get attracted to Krishna and to become attached to Krishna, to become connected with Krishna in eternal relationship of love. That is the goal. I'll stop here. Thank you very much."
