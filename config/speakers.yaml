# Canonical speaker names — exact form as desired in Notion's Speaker property.
# Fuzzy matching (rapidfuzz WRatio, threshold=85) handles title variants:
# honorifics (HG, HH), abbreviations, typos, and ordering differences.
#
# To add a speaker after the initial run:
#   1. Add their canonical name here.
#   2. Re-run the pipeline — already-processed videos are skipped automatically.
#      Previously-skipped unresolved videos (never added to archive.txt)
#      will be automatically discovered and downloaded on the next run.
#
# Populate ALL known speakers before the first pipeline run.
